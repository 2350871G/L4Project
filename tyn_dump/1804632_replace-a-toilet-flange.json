If closing this valve fails to shut off the water supply completely, you\u2019ll have to shut off the water further down the line\u2014potentially at the main shutoff valve near your water meter. Flush and siphon the water out of the tank and bowl. Since the water supply is shut off, the tank won\u2019t refill when you flush once and empty its water into the bowl. Flush again to empty most of the water out of the bowl. Use a wet vac, turkey baster, or large sponge to remove any remaining water in the tank and the bowl. Disconnect the water supply hose.

Cleaning and Inspecting the Toilet Flange Scrape off the old wax ring with a putty knife. The wax ring sits on top of the toilet flange and seals the connection between the flange and the toilet base. The wax ring will be deformed and discolored, but it should scrape away fairly easily with a sturdy putty knife. Keep some newspaper or an old towel nearby so you can wipe off your putty knife as you work. The wax will likely come off in sticky chunks. Take off the screws that attach the flange to the floor. The screws run through the lip of the flange and into the floorboards below. You\u2019ll usually find 4 of them. Turn the heads counterclockwise with a screwdriver to remove them. Keep these as an emergency backup for the screws that come with your new flange kit. Remove the flange if it's made out of PVC and sealed with a gasket. If you have a gasket-sealed PVC flange, which is the most common type, you\u2019ll be able to lift it straight up from the outflow pipe once the screws have been removed. After this, rinse it under the sink and wipe it clean with a rag so you can take a closer look at it. If the flange has no cracks, chips, or deformations, you may choose to just reinstall it with a new wax ring. However, if it doesn\u2019t look to be in ideal condition, it\u2019s best to just replace it. Even if you reuse the flange, always install a new wax ring.

In most cases, the pipe should measure 4 in (10 cm) in diameter. Jot this measurement down for reference when you go to buy the new flange. If you\u2019re able to take the old flange with you to the hardware store, this measurement is largely for backup purposes.

Instead of wax, some newer rings are rubber gaskets instead. However, you can install a rubber gasket the same way you'd install a wax ring. Installing the New Flange and Wax Ring Feed the included bolts into the new flange. Remove the nut and washers on each bolt and set them aside for final installation. The flange lip will have channels on either side, into which you can feed the heads of the 2 bolts. Position the bolts so that they are pointing straight up and are directly across from each other. If you\u2019ve lost the new bolts, you can likely reuse the bolts from the old flange, provided that they\u2019re still in good condition. Push the new flange on and into the outflow pipe.

Securing the Toilet in Place Set the toilet straight down on top of the flange. Line up the holes in the toilet base with the 2 bolts that protrude from the flange. Once the toilet is resting on the flange, press down firmly near the back of the bowl rim to deform the wax ring and seal the connection. This process is the same whether you pressed the wax ring to the underside of the toilet or placed it on top of the flange. Place the washers and nuts onto the exposed bolts. Put a plastic washer onto each bolt first, then follow with a metal one. After that, hand-tighten the nuts clockwise before using a crescent or socket wrench to tightly secure them. If you have plastic caps that cover the bolts, just snap them in place. If the bolts are too long, however, you may need to trim them with a hacksaw so that the plastic caps will fit over them. Reconnect the water supply hose. Hand-tighten the coupling at the end of the braided metal supply hose onto the connection point on the underside of the toilet tank. Use a crescent wrench or adjustable pliers to finish tightening the coupling, if needed. Plastic couplings are usually only intended to be hand-tightened, while metal ones can be tightened with a wrench or pliers. Turn on the water supply to the toilet. Turn the oval-shaped valve counterclockwise to turn the water back on. You\u2019ll hear the toilet tank begin to fill. While the tank fills, check for leaks at the connection point between the supply line and the toilet tank. Flush the toilet multiple times to check for leaks. Carefully check the floor around the base of the toilet. If it stays dry, you\u2019re all set. If you see any water seeping out, you\u2019ll need to remove the toilet and try again\u2014or call a plumber.",

        " Removing the Toilet Place newspapers or towels on the floor next to the toilet.",
        "You will place the toilet on these after you disconnect it from the flange.",
        "Leave enough room to work on the toilet flange, but lay the newspapers or towels close by so you don\u2019t have to move the toilet too far.",
        "You could also place the removed toilet in a nearby tub or shower stall, but there\u2019s a chance the bottom of the toilet will scratch up the tile and/or the tub\u2019s finish.",
        "Turn off the water supply to the toilet.",
        "You\u2019ll usually find an oval-shaped shutoff valve protruding either from the floor or the wall, behind and to the left or right of the toilet.",
        "Turn this valve clockwise to shut off the water.",
        "If closing this valve fails to shut off the water supply completely, you\u2019ll have to shut off the water further down the line\u2014potentially at the main shutoff valve near your water meter.",
        "Flush and siphon the water out of the tank and bowl.",
        "Since the water supply is shut off, the tank won\u2019t refill when you flush once and empty its water into the bowl.",
        "Flush again to empty most of the water out of the bowl.",
        "Use a wet vac, turkey baster, or large sponge to remove any remaining water in the tank and the bowl.",
        "Disconnect the water supply hose.",
        "This runs between the shutoff valve and the toilet tank, and is usually made of braided metal.",
        "Disconnect it at the coupling that attaches to the underside of the toilet tank.",
        "If you can\u2019t loosen it by hand, use adjustable pliers or a crescent wrench to turn the coupling counterclockwise until it disconnects.",
        "A small amount of water will run out of the hose, so keep a towel handy to sop it up.",
        "Remove the 2 nuts that attach the toilet to the floor.",
        "You\u2019ll find these to the left and right of the toilet base, below the bowl.",
        "They may be covered by plastic caps\u2014if so, just pop these off by hand.",
        "Then, unscrew the nuts from the bolts (counterclockwise) by hand or with a socket or crescent wrench.",
        "Each nut should have a metal washer beneath it, and possibly a plastic one as well.",
        "Remove these also.",
        "The new toilet flange set should come with nuts, bolts, and washers, but keep these ones handy just in case you need them.",
        "Lift the toilet straight up and move it to the newspapers or towels.",
        "Toilets weigh between 70\u2013120 lb (32\u201354 kg), so get help if you\u2019re not sure you can lift it.",
        "To lift it alone, straddle the bowl, bend your knees, grip the underside of the toilet between the bowl and tank, and lift straight up with your legs (not your back).",
        "You need to lift the toilet straight up to clear the 2 bolts that are sticking up through the base.",
        "Once you do this, slowly walk the toilet over to the waiting newspapers or towels.",
        "Some residual water may leak out when you do this, so have a towel handy to wipe it up.",
        "Plug up the outflow pipe with an old towel or T-shirt.",
        "Push the towel or shirt securely into the pipe, but don\u2019t stuff it down so far or in so tightly that you won\u2019t be able to retrieve it later.",
        "Blocking the pipe will prevent unpleasant sewer gases from escaping.",
        "Some people wait to block up the pipe until after removing the old flange.",
        "However, by blocking it now, you stop sewer gases earlier and provide protection against accidentally losing things\u2014wax ring bits, screws, bolts, etc.\u2014down the pipe.",
        "Cleaning and Inspecting the Toilet Flange Scrape off the old wax ring with a putty knife.",
        "The wax ring sits on top of the toilet flange and seals the connection between the flange and the toilet base.",
        "The wax ring will be deformed and discolored, but it should scrape away fairly easily with a sturdy putty knife.",
        "Keep some newspaper or an old towel nearby so you can wipe off your putty knife as you work.",
        "The wax will likely come off in sticky chunks.",
        "Take off the screws that attach the flange to the floor.",
        "The screws run through the lip of the flange and into the floorboards below.",
        "You\u2019ll usually find 4 of them.",
        "Turn the heads counterclockwise with a screwdriver to remove them.",
        "Keep these as an emergency backup for the screws that come with your new flange kit.",
        "Remove the flange if it's made out of PVC and sealed with a gasket.",
        "If you have a gasket-sealed PVC flange, which is the most common type, you\u2019ll be able to lift it straight up from the outflow pipe once the screws have been removed.",
        "After this, rinse it under the sink and wipe it clean with a rag so you can take a closer look at it.",
        "If the flange has no cracks, chips, or deformations, you may choose to just reinstall it with a new wax ring.",
        "However, if it doesn\u2019t look to be in ideal condition, it\u2019s best to just replace it.",
        "Even if you reuse the flange, always install a new wax ring.",
        "Call a plumber if you have a glued-in or cast iron flange.",
        "If the flange isn\u2019t both made of PVC and held in the outflow pipe by a rubber gasket, there are 2 other likely options.",
        "It\u2019s probably either made of PVC but glued to a PVC outflow pipe, or it\u2019s made of cast iron and integrated into the cast iron outflow pipe.",
        "In either case, it\u2019s best to call a plumber and have them finish the job for you.",
        "If the flange is PVC but is glued to the inside or outside of a PVC outflow pipe, you\u2019ll have to carefully use a chisel and/or a drill with a hole-saw bit to work it free.",
        "If you damage the outflow pipe in the process, you\u2019ll be facing costly repairs.",
        "If you have an old flange made of cast iron that\u2019s joined to a cast iron outflow pipe, you\u2019ll have to meticulously chip away at the flange lip with a chisel and rubber mallet.",
        "Once again, any damage to the outflow pipe itself will be costly mistake.",
        "Getting the Right Replacement Flange Measure the interior diameter of the exposed outflow pipe.",
        "In most cases, the pipe should measure 4 in (10 cm) in diameter.",
        "Jot this measurement down for reference when you go to buy the new flange.",
        "If you\u2019re able to take the old flange with you to the hardware store, this measurement is largely for backup purposes.",
        "However, if the old flange has broken into pieces, you\u2019ll definitely need this measurement.",
        "Take the old flange to the hardware store and buy a matching one.",
        "Find a new flange that replicates the size and shape of the old one as closely as possible.",
        "This way, you\u2019ll be sure of a solid fit.",
        "If you can\u2019t find a good match or need help in general, ask an employee at the store for help.",
        "If you don\u2019t have the old flange, buy a new flange that matches the outflow pipe measurement you took.",
        "Purchase a new wax ring that fits your new flange.",
        "Some new flange kits come with a wax ring, while others require you to buy the ring separately.",
        "In any case, make sure you have a new wax ring to go with your new flange.",
        "Instead of wax, some newer rings are rubber gaskets instead.",
        "However, you can install a rubber gasket the same way you'd install a wax ring.",
        "Installing the New Flange and Wax Ring Feed the included bolts into the new flange.",
        "Remove the nut and washers on each bolt and set them aside for final installation.",
        "The flange lip will have channels on either side, into which you can feed the heads of the 2 bolts.",
        "Position the bolts so that they are pointing straight up and are directly across from each other.",
        "If you\u2019ve lost the new bolts, you can likely reuse the bolts from the old flange, provided that they\u2019re still in good condition.",
        "Push the new flange on and into the outflow pipe.",
        "The lip of the flange should rest flush on the floor all the way around, while the neck of the flange should slide snugly into the pipe.",
        "Position the flange so that the protruding bolts are at the 3 o\u2019clock and 9 o\u2019clock positions (presuming that the back of the toilet will be at 12 o\u2019clock).",
        "The neck of the flange should have a rubber gasket that creates a seal against the inside of the overflow pipe.",
        "If the lip of the flange won\u2019t rest flush to the floor all the way around, the flooring is likely warped or damaged due to water.",
        "You should do any needed floor repairs (or call in a pro to do them) before proceeding.",
        "Drive screws through the flange lip and into the flooring.",
        "Use a screwdriver (turning it clockwise) to secure the screws that came in the product package.",
        "There will be pre-cut holes in the flange lip where you should drive the screws in.",
        "Use a drill to create new pilot holes in the flooring, if needed.",
        "Existing holes from the previous flange may be in the same location but be too large to hold the new screws.",
        "If so, use a mallet to tap plastic wall anchors into the holes, then drive the screws through the flange lip and into the anchors.",
        "Most toilet flanges come with 4 screws, but yours may have more or fewer.",
        "Remove the towel or T-shirt from the outflow pipe.",
        "Pick out any pieces of wax ring, loose screws or washers, etc.",
        "before removing the towel or shirt.",
        "Otherwise they may fall down the pipe.",
        "Don\u2019t plan on using this towel or shirt again\u2014just toss it!",
        "Tilt up the toilet and push the new wax ring into place.",
        "Press the rounded side of the wax ring over the pipe stub that surrounds the opening on the bottom of the toilet.",
        "Press firmly all the way around the wax ring, but don\u2019t deform it.",
        "Pros usually prefer to apply the wax ring this way in order to guarantee a good seal around the toilet.",
        "However, you can also lay the ring (rounded side up) on top of the toilet flange, then set the toilet on top of it.",
        "If you\u2019re using the newer type of \u201cwax ring\u201d that is actually a rubber gasket, lay it rounded side up on the toilet flange and place the toilet on top of it.",
        "Securing the Toilet in Place Set the toilet straight down on top of the flange.",
        "Line up the holes in the toilet base with the 2 bolts that protrude from the flange.",
        "Once the toilet is resting on the flange, press down firmly near the back of the bowl rim to deform the wax ring and seal the connection.",
        "This process is the same whether you pressed the wax ring to the underside of the toilet or placed it on top of the flange.",
        "Place the washers and nuts onto the exposed bolts.",
        "Put a plastic washer onto each bolt first, then follow with a metal one.",
        "After that, hand-tighten the nuts clockwise before using a crescent or socket wrench to tightly secure them.",

        "Use a crescent wrench or adjustable pliers to finish tightening the coupling, if needed.",
        "Plastic couplings are usually only intended to be hand-tightened, while metal ones can be tightened with a wrench or pliers.",
        "Turn on the water supply to the toilet.",
        "Turn the oval-shaped valve counterclockwise to turn the water back on.",
