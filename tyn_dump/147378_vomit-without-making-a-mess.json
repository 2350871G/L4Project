Whether you've made it to a bathroom, found a trash can, or stepped outside to a safe outdoor environment, you'll want to prepare yourself as best you can for what's about to happen. If you have long hair, tie it back, tuck it behind your ears, or hold it in place behind your head. Vomit in your hair will quickly ruin your night and make an absolute mess. Remove any long, dangling necklaces, or at least tuck them into your shirt. This could create a similar complication as long hair. Try to direct the stream of vomit away from your shoes, pants, and hands (if you're on all fours). Aim slightly ahead of where you're standing/sitting/crawling. If indoors, keep your head above the toilet or trash can. Try to lower your head enough that no vomit will splatter outside the container you're vomiting into. If you're sick in bed, keep a trash can and a stack of towels next to the bed. That way, if you can't reach the trash can or make it to the toilet, you can put down a towel to vomit onto/into. The towel can easily be washed, and it will be much easier to clean up than if you threw up in your bed or on the carpet."

Do not chug the water or attempt to drink it quickly - just sip on it slowly and steadily.
