Which narrative you choose is an important part of adding realism to your work, as the extent to which you can explore the emotions, feelings, perspectives, etc. of the character in detail depends upon the form you've chosen. For some authors, first person narrative provides a better opportunity to sound realistic while for other authors, the third person narrative works better. It really comes down to what your own writing style is. First person narrative: A character (or characters) narrates the story. He/she is involved in the story but reveals his/her own feelings and experiences much of the time through the use of \"I\" or \"we\" viewpoints. Second person narrative: This is an attempt to make the reader become a character in the story, and the reader will be referred to as \"you\". It's not used a lot, as it is not an easy form in which to write. Third person narrative: This is from the perspective of he/she or they and the author is simply narrating things in a usually uninvolved way. The narrator may be aware of the main character's feelings and thoughts only or the narrator may be aware of the feelings and thoughts of a wider array of characters. Or, the narrator may choose to simply observe things as they unfold without describing the feelings and thoughts of the characters. The third person form is the most commonly used and it can be subject to different approaches, depending on your writing style. Mixing it up: It is possible to mix narrative forms if you're a good writer. However, you will need to plan this with care and introduce narrative changes at key points, and not jump around between them all over the place. For example, you might use third person throughout most of the story but for an intervening part or chapter, use the first person to give an overview or summary, then return to the third person."

Here are some genres that you could write: \nAction\nFantasy\nScience- fiction\nRomance\nAdventure\nErotica\nComedy\nDrama\nPrequel\nSequel. Note that no matter the genre, it is possible to write realistically. Even within fantasy, you can make the actions and world seem as real as the things that happen in the reader's own world every day. For fantasy and science-fiction, you will need excellent descriptive skills to bring the world and beings alive in realistic ways. If you are weak in this area, do some studying to strengthen your descriptive writing skills first. Finding your Idea Settle on an original main idea. All famous books start off with a key idea. You can find ideas anywhere. Try listening to the radio for news stories that could give you ideas. Look up pictures on the internet that could give you inspiration. Maybe another book could inspire your idea. Even if you want to write a prequel or a sequel, you should still get your main plot. Try to notice all of the small yet important details in your daily life. Write your ideas down so you can remember them all.

What caused the problem? What happens in the middle? How did or did not it get fixed? How do the characters have connection to each other and the problem? How does it end? Use your answers to write the story. Use all of your ideas as the story unfolds, as they offer you guidance in keeping the details realistic. Use a pencil, pen, computer anything as long as your writing is neat. Figure out whether your story is in the first, second, or third person.
