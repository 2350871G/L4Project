        "Weight down and let dry.",
        "Since the wet glue is not exposed to the air this time, it may take several hours longer to dry than the outside did.",
        "Cut out the top page.",
        "You don't want your compartment covered, of course.",
        "Cut out a rectangle in that single page so it matches the pages beneath it.",
        "Now your book safe is ready to hold your treasures.",
        "Extras: Paperbacks, Intricate Designs, and Power Tools Use the nail down method for paperbacks and extra thick books.",
        "Gluing the pages together before cutting keeps them steady, but this makes deep cuts awkward and still doesn't hold a paperback in place all that well.",
        "Try this method instead for these projects:\nTake two small pieces of fiberboard (or any similar scrap board) and sandwich the pages you plan to cut between them.",
        "Hammer four finishing nails through the top board and most of the pages, almost to the bottom board.",
        "Cut through the first layer of pages as usual and rip them out.",
        "Turn the top board and hollowed-out pages over and secure with a weight or rubber band.",
        "Repeat to cut through the rest of the book.",
        "The nails hold the pages in place, and turning the completed pages over improves your access to each fresh page.",
        "Cut with a scroll saw for intricate designs.",
        "Use the \"nail down\" approach described above to hold the pages steady.",
        "Trace a design on the board \u2014 as intricate as you like \u2014 and cut through from one board to the other using a scroll saw.",
        "Preferably, use a blade with a relatively low number of teeth per inch.",
        "If you reach a turn too sharp for the scroll saw, withdraw the saw and start again from an additional pilot hole.",
        "Book dust, especially from old musty books, can cause allergic reactions, breathing problems, and infections.",
        "Wear a respirator mask while cutting and work in a well-ventilated area.",
        "A dremel doesn't give you the same level of control, but it can speed up cutting the rectangle in the basic method above.",
        "Punch out paper quickly with a hole saw.",
        "Drill a hole through a piece of lumber using a hole saw.",
        "Clamp this over the pages you want to cut, with a solid piece of lumber on the other side.",
        "Drill a hole through the page, then use that hole as a guide for your hole saw.",
        "This will cut through the circle rapidly, although you do need to stop frequently to remove paper from the saw and allow it to cool down.",
        "This is the fastest option available, but you are limited by the shape of your hole saw.",
        "You can create larger patterns in different shapes by shifting the lumber to a different spot on the page and cutting additional, overlapping circles."
