Using dark colors on the wall can make the room appear more formal while lighter tones can make a small space look larger. If you can't choose just one color, you can paint the walls different colors. For example, paint an earthy brown on one wall and a warm green for a rustic themed dining room. Two colors are great for walls that have panels or molding because the walls are already divided. You can easily transform the space with paint, so don't be afraid to choose a bold color."

Use two bold colors that contrast if you want the walls to have a modern or contemporary look. For example, paint the lower half of the wall in a crisp white and paint the upper half in a rich navy blue. Or use two pale, neutral colors such as cream and pale pink for a soft and casual look. You can put up wallpaper as an accent or to cover the walls, but it's usually more expensive than paint. As an alternative, use paneling, such as shiplap or fabric wallpaper. These are fun, durable options for a dining room."
