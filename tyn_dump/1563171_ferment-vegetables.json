Choose vegetables that were grown nearby, and opt for organic when possible. You can ferment one vegetable at a time, or pack several types together for a delicious \"salad\" of fermented vegetables. Here are a few popular choices:\n\nCucumbers. Fermented cucumbers - pickles - are a great place to start if you've never fermented before. Try packing pickles alone or with onions, carrots and peppers. (Do not use waxed cucumbers. To see if a cucumber is waxed, scrape the cucumber with a fingernail. Ask for pickling cucumbers at the store.) Cabbage. Fermenting cabbage turns it into tart, crispy sauerkraut. Consider  making kimchi for a spicy spin on cabbage fermentation. Peppers. Peppers may be fermented on their own or packed with another vegetable to add some heat. Green beans or asparagus. Pickled green beans or asparagus are a welcome treat in the winter months when the fresh green taste of summer is hard to come by."

                    "description": "When vegetables are covered in a liquid solution, the natural bacteria present in their skin begins to break down the cellular structure in the process of fermentation. Vegetables will ferment in plain water, but their taste and texture is better with the addition of salt, which promotes the growth of \"good\" bacteria and inhibits the growth of \"bad\" bacteria, resulting in crispy, tasty vegetables. The standard amount of salt to add is 3 tablespoons per 5 pounds of vegetables. If you're on a low sodium diet, it's fine to add salt to taste. The less salt you add, the quicker the vegetables will ferment. Adding more salt will cause the process to go more slowly. If you don't want to add much salt, using a starter culture will help promote the growth of good bacteria and stifle the growth of bad bacteria. You can add whey, kefir grains, or dried starter culture to the mix and reduce the amount of salt. Be aware, however, that using a starter culture without any salt will result in less crisp vegetables."

You can buy fermenting vessels that have a weight and cover system in place, or devise your own using less expensive household supplies. If you use a ceramic crock, find a small, heavy plate that fits inside the crock. Place a heavy jar or rock on top of the plate to serve as a weight.
