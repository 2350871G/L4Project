Keeping your neck at unnatural angles for long periods of time can cause neck injury. If you\u2019re watching TV on a laptop, elevate the laptop to shoulder height.

Run for ten minutes and then walk for another five minutes, repeating until you\u2019re done watching television. If you\u2019re an experienced runner, you can run for longer intervals of time and walk less to burn more calories. For example, if you run for an entire a 44-minute episode of a TV show at 4 mph, you\u2019ll burn approximately 152 calories. If you\u2019re a beginner you can walk throughout the entire workout and slowly increase your speed every week."

Then, increase the incline on your treadmill to 3-10%. Walk at 2.5-3 mph for about thirty minutes. This is the perfect exercise for a shorter TV show and it\u2019s surprisingly difficult! This workout is especially good for toning leg and buttock muscles."

Next, increase the resistance and speed to make the workout more difficult. Engage your arms by pushing and pulling as you step and engage your core muscles by flexing your stomach tightly as you exercise.
