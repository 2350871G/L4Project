Michelle Driscoll, MPH\t\t\tFounder, Mulberry Maids\t\t\t\tMichelle Driscoll, a cleaning expert, recommends: \"When cleaning marble, be sure to stay away from harsh chemicals, like bleach, ammonia, hydrogen peroxide, and vinegar. Use a pH-neutral soap diluted in hot water to mop the floors. Then, dry the marble with a soft rag rather than allowing it to air-dry.\""
