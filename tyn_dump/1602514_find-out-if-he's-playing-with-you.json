If he\u2019s really playing you, then he probably has his balancing act down to an art. If you try to change his usual schedule, then you may be able to call his bluff. Ask yourself if he\u2019s always the one who decides where you should go. Of course, he may just want to take charge for other reasons, but this could be a giveaway that he wants to steer you away from places where you\u2019re likely to run in to some of his other ladies."

If he doesn\u2019t want you to meet his friends, it may be for the same reason, with the additional worry that his friends may say something about the other girls he\u2019s seeing. Whether he\u2019s seeing someone else or not, if you\u2019ve been together for a while and he\u2019s shown no interest in wanting to meet your friends or have you meet his, then it\u2019s a red flag. If he doesn\u2019t want to become a bigger part of your life, then it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want things to get too serious. That said, if you try to rush him into meeting your friends, or even your family, after just a few weeks of dating, then you may be moving too fast. He may have legitimate reasons for taking things slow, like wanting to make sure he knows where things stand, or giving his friends some time to get used to the idea of him having a new girlfriend because he recently got out of a serious relationship."

Either he\u2019s acting weird because he\u2019s seeing another girl and doesn\u2019t want to be seen with you, or because he doesn\u2019t want his friends or anyone else to think he\u2019s dating you. Either way, this should be a cause for concern. If he really cares for you, then he should be excited to see you and should even show you some affection. Of course, he doesn\u2019t have to be as affectionate in public as he would be in private, but he should act like he really wants to see you. Check out his body language. Does he make eye contact and move toward you? If so, then that\u2019s a good sign. But if he stands away from you, crosses his arms over his chest, and keeps looking around instead of looking at you, then this means that he\u2019s trying to keep his distance."

Though not all guys are into holding hands, for example, he should want to give you some sort of affection if he really cares for you. You don\u2019t want to put the pressure on him to be affectionate in public too early, but if you\u2019ve gone on several dates and he still stands a foot away from you any time you\u2019re out together, then this may be a cause for concern."

Maybe he\u2019s in the mood to hang out with you on certain days, while he thinks he has better things to do on others. Whether this means he\u2019d rather hang with another girl or spend time with his buddies, if he\u2019s always hot and cold, then he\u2019s definitely playing with you. Think about it: does he often leave you feeling confused about what he really feels about you or where you stand with him? If so, then this may be because he\u2019s playing with your emotions."

He would always spend a night out with his buddies, but when it comes to you, he\u2019ll only hang out with you on certain times, when you suspect that his friends might be busy or that he has nothing else on his social calendar. If he really likes you, then he\u2019ll think of you as a priority, not as social sloppy seconds. If you want to know if he\u2019s playing with you, see if he\u2019ll ever give up a night with his friends for a nice evening with you. If the guy is serious about you, then he should be excited about hanging out with you instead of his friends, at least some of the time. Though you don\u2019t want him to give up his other friends or his social life for you completely, if he makes no compromises for you at all, then it may be because he\u2019s playing with you."

If he\u2019s always checking his phone and then texting away from your direction, stepping out to take calls a lot without telling you who called, or goes hours without picking up his phone with no explanation, then it may be because he\u2019s playing you. Of course, some guys are protective about their privacy and that\u2019s perfectly normal, but if he\u2019s always on his phone and you never know what he\u2019s doing, then it may be a red flag that he\u2019s playing you. Think about it: does he ever leave his phone out, even for a second, or is it always stuck in his pocket? Though you don\u2019t want to snoop through it, if you can tell that he\u2019s freaked out even about the idea of you seeing who is calling or texting him, then you may have a problem. Another thing you can look out for is if he turns off his phone completely when he\u2019s hanging out with you. Though this may be a sweet gesture to give you his full attention, it may also be his way of warding off other girls who might be calling him when you\u2019re together."

The truth of the matter is that if a guy really wants to hang out with you, that he\u2019ll find the time to do it. Though there are exceptions if he really does get super busy, if you find out that he\u2019s spending that time with other people, then it should be a cause for concern. If he says he\u2019s busy studying or doing work and then you find out that he\u2019s been doing something else, even if he\u2019s just hanging out with his brother, then he\u2019s playing you.

If he cares about you and you\u2019ve been seeing each other a while, then he should be excited about the relationship and should want his friends to know who you are. If he\u2019s sweet to you when it\u2019s just the two of you, but is more buddy buddy or even distant around his friends, then he may just like to flirt with you without wanting anything serious. Of course, some guys like to act tough in front of their friends, and he may not shower you with kisses when you meet them.

If he introduces you to people as his friend or even seems like he\u2019s not feeling it when you call him your boyfriend, then it may be because he\u2019s playing you. Sometimes, words do speak louder than actions, and if he refuses to call you his girlfriend though you\u2019ve been dating for a while, then there must be a reason behind it.

If he really likes you, then he\u2019ll find no need to talk to other girls in a flirtatious way. Sure, he can still talk to them and he doesn\u2019t have to ignore every girl but you, but if you can tell from the way he talks to other girls that he wants more from them than just friendship, then he may be playing you. Though you don\u2019t want to spy on him or get too obsessive, if one of your friends is at a party where he\u2019s talking to other girls, ask your friend what it was like.

Though you don\u2019t want to interrogate him, if you just ask a few questions without making a big deal about it, you may even be able to catch him in a lie.

Tell your friends to be honest with you. They shouldn\u2019t lie to you just to spare your feelings. They can investigate a bit if you really want them to. If it won\u2019t look too obvious, you can have one of your friends casually show up in a place where your guy is likely to be and to keep an eye on him to see how he is with other girls.

Whether you\u2019re driving at a far distance away, walking, or taking the bus, try to be far enough away that he doesn\u2019t see you and to have a ready-made story in case he does catch you in the act.

Snooping is a last resort and you should only do it if you feel like you really need answers and nothing else is working. The problem with snooping is that, even if you\u2019ve found evidence, you\u2019ll have to admit that you\u2019ve been going through the guy\u2019s things if you want to call him out. This will make him angry at you, and will take the focus off the real situation. If you\u2019re looking through his phone, have an excuse ready in case he catches you. You can say that your phone died and that you were looking up the restaurant where you two were having dinner or that you needed to quickly check your email or something.

If he doesn\u2019t want you to meet his friends, it may be for the same reason, with the additional worry that his friends may say something about the other girls he\u2019s seeing. Whether he\u2019s seeing someone else or not, if you\u2019ve been together for a while and he\u2019s shown no interest in wanting to meet your friends or have you meet his, then it\u2019s a red flag. If he doesn\u2019t want to become a bigger part of your life, then it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t want things to get too serious. That said, if you try to rush him into meeting your friends, or even your family, after just a few weeks of dating, then you may be moving too fast. He may have legitimate reasons for taking things slow, like wanting to make sure he knows where things stand, or giving his friends some time to get used to the idea of him having a new girlfriend because he recently got out of a serious relationship. See if he acts weird if he runs into you in public. If things are great when you and your guy are alone and he suddenly gives you the cold shoulder when you run into him at the mall or outside a restaurant, then something is definitely up. Either he\u2019s acting weird because he\u2019s seeing another girl and doesn\u2019t want to be seen with you, or because he doesn\u2019t want his friends or anyone else to think he\u2019s dating you. Either way, this should be a cause for concern. If he really cares for you, then he should be excited to see you and should even show you some affection. Of course, he doesn\u2019t have to be as affectionate in public as he would be in private, but he should act like he really wants to see you. Check out his body language. Does he make eye contact and move toward you? If so, then that\u2019s a good sign. But if he stands away from you, crosses his arms over his chest, and keeps looking around instead of looking at you, then this means that he\u2019s trying to keep his distance. See if he\u2019s reluctant to be affectionate with you in public. If you two go out on a date but he acts like you\u2019re brother and sister, then you should be asking yourself why. If he\u2019s playing you, then he doesn\u2019t want the world to know that he\u2019s seeing you, either because he\u2019s also seeing someone else or he just wants to keep his options open. Though not all guys are into holding hands, for example, he should want to give you some sort of affection if he really cares for you. You don\u2019t want to put the pressure on him to be affectionate in public too early, but if you\u2019ve gone on several dates and he still stands a foot away from you any time you\u2019re out together, then this may be a cause for concern. See if he\u2019s sweet to you one minute and distant the next. If he\u2019s all loving, sweet, kind, and wanting to kiss you one minute and then the next, he acts like he barely knows who you are, then this may be because he\u2019s playing with you. Maybe he\u2019s in the mood to hang out with you on certain days, while he thinks he has better things to do on others. Whether this means he\u2019d rather hang with another girl or spend time with his buddies, if he\u2019s always hot and cold, then he\u2019s definitely playing with you. Think about it: does he often leave you feeling confused about what he really feels about you or where you stand with him? If so, then this may be because he\u2019s playing with your emotions. See if he would never give up a night with his friends for you. If the guy is playing with you, then he\u2019ll never think that you come first with him. He would always spend a night out with his buddies, but when it comes to you, he\u2019ll only hang out with you on certain times, when you suspect that his friends might be busy or that he has nothing else on his social calendar. If he really likes you, then he\u2019ll think of you as a priority, not as social sloppy seconds. If you want to know if he\u2019s playing with you, see if he\u2019ll ever give up a night with his friends for a nice evening with you. If the guy is serious about you, then he should be excited about hanging out with you instead of his friends, at least some of the time. Though you don\u2019t want him to give up his other friends or his social life for you completely, if he makes no compromises for you at all, then it may be because he\u2019s playing with you. See if he\u2019s shady with his phone. One dead giveaway that a guy is playing with you is that he\u2019s very secretive when it comes to his phone. If he\u2019s always checking his phone and then texting away from your direction, stepping out to take calls a lot without telling you who called, or goes hours without picking up his phone with no explanation, then it may be because he\u2019s playing you. Of course, some guys are protective about their privacy and that\u2019s perfectly normal, but if he\u2019s always on his phone and you never know what he\u2019s doing, then it may be a red flag that he\u2019s playing you. Think about it: does he ever leave his phone out, even for a second, or is it always stuck in his pocket? Though you don\u2019t want to snoop through it, if you can tell that he\u2019s freaked out even about the idea of you seeing who is calling or texting him, then you may have a problem. Another thing you can look out for is if he turns off his phone completely when he\u2019s hanging out with you. Though this may be a sweet gesture to give you his full attention, it may also be his way of warding off other girls who might be calling him when you\u2019re together. Seeing What He Says See if he\u2019s always saying he\u2019s too busy for you but he seems to have plenty of time for everyone else. If you\u2019ve heard him tell you how busy he is again and again, saying that he doesn\u2019t have ten free minutes for anyone, and then you heard that he spent his night out with a bunch of friends, then this may be a sign that he\u2019s playing with you. The truth of the matter is that if a guy really wants to hang out with you, that he\u2019ll find the time to do it. Though there are exceptions if he really does get super busy, if you find out that he\u2019s spending that time with other people, then it should be a cause for concern. If he says he\u2019s busy studying or doing work and then you find out that he\u2019s been doing something else, even if he\u2019s just hanging out with his brother, then he\u2019s playing you. If he cared for you, then he\u2019d be honest about what he was doing instead of lying. See if he\u2019s reluctant to commit to anything more than two weeks in the future. If your guy tries to change the subject any time you try to talk about the future, even if you\u2019re only talking about your holiday plans, which are a month away, then this may be a sign that he\u2019s playing you. If he\u2019s serious about you, then he\u2019ll want to see you as a part of his future and he won\u2019t back off when you bring it up. Of course, if you\u2019ve been dating for three weeks and start talking about your wedding, it\u2019s natural that he\u2019ll freak out, but if you just bring up what you\u2019ll both be doing a month from now, then he\u2019ll have no reason to worry if he cares for you. Listen to how he talks about you and the relationship. If he never, ever brings up the future or includes you in his future plans, then he may be playing you. See if he hasn\u2019t told any of his friends about you. If you finally meet his friends or run into his friends and they say something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t know he had a girlfriend\u2026\u201d or just look surprised by your presence, then this is because the guy didn\u2019t think your relationship was serious enough for him to bring it up to his friends. If he cares about you and you\u2019ve been seeing each other a while, then he should be excited about the relationship and should want his friends to know who you are. If he\u2019s sweet to you when it\u2019s just the two of you, but is more buddy buddy or even distant around his friends, then he may just like to flirt with you without wanting anything serious. Of course, some guys like to act tough in front of their friends, and he may not shower you with kisses when you meet them. But if he\u2019s never even told them about you, then he may just be playing you. See if he\u2019s reluctant to call you his girlfriend. If you consider him your boyfriend and have been seeing only him for months while you\u2019ve never heard the word \u201cgirlfriend\u201d come out of his mouth, then this may be because he doesn\u2019t think the relationship is as serious as you think it is. If he introduces you to people as his friend or even seems like he\u2019s not feeling it when you call him your boyfriend, then it may be because he\u2019s playing you. Sometimes, words do speak louder than actions, and if he refuses to call you his girlfriend though you\u2019ve been dating for a while, then there must be a reason behind it. He may be afraid of commitment without playing you. If this is the case, you still need to have a talk about it. See how he talks to other girls. If you want to know if he\u2019s playing you, then you should see how he talks to the other girls he knows. Sure, he may be polite and not interested when he talks to other girls if you\u2019re standing right next to him, but if you see him talking to a girl out of the corner of your eye from the other side of the room and he\u2019s being incredibly flirtatious, then this may be because he\u2019s playing you. If he really likes you, then he\u2019ll find no need to talk to other girls in a flirtatious way. Sure, he can still talk to them and he doesn\u2019t have to ignore every girl but you, but if you can tell from the way he talks to other girls that he wants more from them than just friendship, then he may be playing you. Though you don\u2019t want to spy on him or get too obsessive, if one of your friends is at a party where he\u2019s talking to other girls, ask your friend what it was like. Though your friend shouldn\u2019t be too obvious about watching him, you may get a better read on the situation this way than you would if you were in the room yourself. See if he\u2019s always full of excuses. A classic sign of a player is a man who is always full of excuses. He may be so smooth and so convincing that you don\u2019t even notice that he\u2019s completely lying to you. He may tell you about his grandmother getting sick, his dog needing to go to the vet, or about how he forgot your date because he \u201coverslept\u201d or had to comfort a friend. Sure, things happen, but if you find that he has a perfect excuse for every little reason why he\u2019s disappointed you, then he may be playing you. If you\u2019ve heard the excuse \u201cmy phone died\u201d more than twice, then chances are, this is not the real reason he didn\u2019t call you back. If he seems extra sweet and apologetic when he gives you these excuses, then it may be because he\u2019s covering up the fact that he\u2019s lying. See if he starts acting nervous when you ask him about his night. Another way to see if he\u2019s playing you is to simply ask him how his night went if he told you he was staying in or hanging out with his friends. While you don\u2019t need to ask about every little detail of the night, if you casually just ask a few questions about what happened, whether you ask what movie he watched when he was staying in alone or which bar he went to if he was supposedly out with his friends, you should check out his body language and words to see if he gets nervous, starts stuttering, or just acts uncomfortable. Though you don\u2019t want to interrogate him, if you just ask a few questions without making a big deal about it, you may even be able to catch him in a lie. Ask him while you\u2019re doing something else, like scrolling through your phone, so he doesn\u2019t see that you\u2019re really trying to figure him out. Finding Out For Sure Ask him. If you want to know if a guy is playing you, the easiest way can be to ask him. Though you may not want to know if he\u2019s cheating on you, you can just ask him where you stand with him. If he\u2019s not feeling it as much as you are, then you\u2019re better off knowing sooner rather than later. Simply find some time to be alone and ask him what his thoughts are about you and your future together. Though this may not be easy, this is far better than wondering for months. You\u2019ll have a definitive answer, once and for all. And if he\u2019s obviously lying, then you\u2019ll be able to see that, too. If you\u2019re really feeling bold, you can just flat-out ask him if he\u2019s cheating. Point to some shady behavior that has led you to feel this way. Ask your friends what they think. Though it\u2019s best to just ask him yourself, you can also get some great feedback from your friends, too. They\u2019ve been watching the situation unfold and may have a sense of what the relationship is like from the outside. They may even have a better sense of whether or not he\u2019s playing you because they might have seen him with girls without you and may have a different impression. Tell your friends to be honest with you. They shouldn\u2019t lie to you just to spare your feelings. They can investigate a bit if you really want them to. If it won\u2019t look too obvious, you can have one of your friends casually show up in a place where your guy is likely to be and to keep an eye on him to see how he is with other girls. Of course, if he thinks you\u2019ve sent a spy in his direction, he\u2019ll be on his best behavior. Consider following him. Okay, so if you really don\u2019t care about being found out or breaking his trust, then one thing you can do is to follow your guy after you\u2019ve been hanging out, or just when you know he\u2019ll be at a certain place, to see what he\u2019s been up to. Whether you\u2019re driving at a far distance away, walking, or taking the bus, try to be far enough away that he doesn\u2019t see you and to have a ready-made story in case he does catch you in the act. This can lead you to see if he\u2019s seeing any other girls\u2014or if he\u2019s just going home to hang out with his cat. Just know that this is pretty risky behavior that can lead you to get caught. If you\u2019re caught and he hasn\u2019t been doing anything wrong, this can be a relationship ender for you, so make sure you really think following him is a good idea before you begin. Show up at his place when he doesn\u2019t expect it. Another way to find out if he\u2019s playing you is to show up at his place unannounced. You can pop in an hour earlier than you said you\u2019d be there to see if there\u2019s a different woman there or if he\u2019s suspiciously cleaning everything up. You can also just drop by because you\u2019re \u201cin the area\u201d at a time when he\u2019s supposed to be studying or home working to bring him some coffee or a treat. When you show up, see if he\u2019s happy to see you or if he seems nervous, like he\u2019s hiding something\u2014or someone. Of course, if it\u2019s totally absurd that you would show up at his house out of the blue, then he\u2019ll be on to you. But if you\u2019ve come over there before and it hasn\u2019t been a big deal, just try to make it seem natural. Snoop through his things\u2014if you\u2019re okay with breaking his trust. Though snooping through your guy\u2019s things won\u2019t win you any trust points, if you\u2019re desperate and feel pretty sure that you want to cheat on him, then you can try looking through his phone or his email, or even looking through his room for suspicious items like female clothing that is obviously not yours. Snooping is a last resort and you should only do it if you feel like you really need answers and nothing else is working. The problem with snooping is that, even if you\u2019ve found evidence, you\u2019ll have to admit that you\u2019ve been going through the guy\u2019s things if you want to call him out. This will make him angry at you, and will take the focus off the real situation. If you\u2019re looking through his phone, have an excuse ready in case he catches you. You can say that your phone died and that you were looking up the restaurant where you two were having dinner or that you needed to quickly check your email or something. Though this may not be too convincing, it may be better than nothing. Try to catch him in a lie. You can also try to catch the guy in a lie to find out if he\u2019s playing you. If he\u2019s mentioned that he hung out with his friends or brother the other night, when you see them, you can ask about how the boy\u2019s night out went; if they look confused, then you may know that he lied. If he tells a story about how he had to stay home because his sister was having drama, you can ask him how she\u2019s feeling a few days later; if he acts like he has no idea what you\u2019re talking about, then it may be because he already forgot his own lie. You can even try asking him simple questions like which movie he saw if he went to the movies with his friends. If he looks embarrassed or clearly doesn\u2019t know the answer, then you\u2019ll know that he\u2019s playing you. Even if there\u2019s no proof, trust your gut. If you just get the feeling that the guy isn\u2019t sincere even though you can\u2019t find any proof of it through snooping, then it may be time to end the relationship. Maybe he\u2019s not seeing other girls, but he still can be playing with you just because he\u2019s not feeling it as much as you are. As long as you know you\u2019re not the one with jealousy issues and see that you have a real reason to be concerned, if you really think he might be playing you, then it\u2019s time to cut him loose. When you\u2019re with a guy who really cares for you and who is there for only you, you\u2019ll know. You won\u2019t spend hours calling him and wondering where he is and you won\u2019t have to stoop as low as snooping through his things or following him because you\u2019ll have no reason to do it. You\u2019ll know that he\u2019s there for you 100% and that will be an amazing feeling.",

        "If he\u2019s serious about you, then he\u2019ll want to see you as a part of his future and he won\u2019t back off when you bring it up.",
        "Of course, if you\u2019ve been dating for three weeks and start talking about your wedding, it\u2019s natural that he\u2019ll freak out, but if you just bring up what you\u2019ll both be doing a month from now, then he\u2019ll have no reason to worry if he cares for you.",
        "Listen to how he talks about you and the relationship.",
        "If he never, ever brings up the future or includes you in his future plans, then he may be playing you.",
        "See if he hasn\u2019t told any of his friends about you.",
        "If you finally meet his friends or run into his friends and they say something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t know he had a girlfriend\u2026\u201d or just look surprised by your presence, then this is because the guy didn\u2019t think your relationship was serious enough for him to bring it up to his friends.",
        "If he cares about you and you\u2019ve been seeing each other a while, then he should be excited about the relationship and should want his friends to know who you are.",
        "If he\u2019s sweet to you when it\u2019s just the two of you, but is more buddy buddy or even distant around his friends, then he may just like to flirt with you without wanting anything serious.",
        "Of course, some guys like to act tough in front of their friends, and he may not shower you with kisses when you meet them.",
        "But if he\u2019s never even told them about you, then he may just be playing you.",
        "See if he\u2019s reluctant to call you his girlfriend.",
        "If you consider him your boyfriend and have been seeing only him for months while you\u2019ve never heard the word \u201cgirlfriend\u201d come out of his mouth, then this may be because he doesn\u2019t think the relationship is as serious as you think it is.",
        "If he introduces you to people as his friend or even seems like he\u2019s not feeling it when you call him your boyfriend, then it may be because he\u2019s playing you.",
        "Sometimes, words do speak louder than actions, and if he refuses to call you his girlfriend though you\u2019ve been dating for a while, then there must be a reason behind it.",
        "He may be afraid of commitment without playing you.",
        "If this is the case, you still need to have a talk about it.",
        "See how he talks to other girls.",
        "If you want to know if he\u2019s playing you, then you should see how he talks to the other girls he knows.",
        "Sure, he may be polite and not interested when he talks to other girls if you\u2019re standing right next to him, but if you see him talking to a girl out of the corner of your eye from the other side of the room and he\u2019s being incredibly flirtatious, then this may be because he\u2019s playing you.",
        "If he really likes you, then he\u2019ll find no need to talk to other girls in a flirtatious way.",
        "Sure, he can still talk to them and he doesn\u2019t have to ignore every girl but you, but if you can tell from the way he talks to other girls that he wants more from them than just friendship, then he may be playing you.",
        "Though you don\u2019t want to spy on him or get too obsessive, if one of your friends is at a party where he\u2019s talking to other girls, ask your friend what it was like.",
        "Though your friend shouldn\u2019t be too obvious about watching him, you may get a better read on the situation this way than you would if you were in the room yourself.",
        "See if he\u2019s always full of excuses.",
        "A classic sign of a player is a man who is always full of excuses.",
        "He may be so smooth and so convincing that you don\u2019t even notice that he\u2019s completely lying to you.",
        "He may tell you about his grandmother getting sick, his dog needing to go to the vet, or about how he forgot your date because he \u201coverslept\u201d or had to comfort a friend.",
        "Sure, things happen, but if you find that he has a perfect excuse for every little reason why he\u2019s disappointed you, then he may be playing you.",
        "If you\u2019ve heard the excuse \u201cmy phone died\u201d more than twice, then chances are, this is not the real reason he didn\u2019t call you back.",
        "If he seems extra sweet and apologetic when he gives you these excuses, then it may be because he\u2019s covering up the fact that he\u2019s lying.",
        "See if he starts acting nervous when you ask him about his night.",
        "Another way to see if he\u2019s playing you is to simply ask him how his night went if he told you he was staying in or hanging out with his friends.",
        "While you don\u2019t need to ask about every little detail of the night, if you casually just ask a few questions about what happened, whether you ask what movie he watched when he was staying in alone or which bar he went to if he was supposedly out with his friends, you should check out his body language and words to see if he gets nervous, starts stuttering, or just acts uncomfortable.",
        "Though you don\u2019t want to interrogate him, if you just ask a few questions without making a big deal about it, you may even be able to catch him in a lie.",
        "Ask him while you\u2019re doing something else, like scrolling through your phone, so he doesn\u2019t see that you\u2019re really trying to figure him out.",
        "Finding Out For Sure Ask him.",
        "If you want to know if a guy is playing you, the easiest way can be to ask him.",
        "Though you may not want to know if he\u2019s cheating on you, you can just ask him where you stand with him.",
        "If he\u2019s not feeling it as much as you are, then you\u2019re better off knowing sooner rather than later.",
        "Simply find some time to be alone and ask him what his thoughts are about you and your future together.",
        "Though this may not be easy, this is far better than wondering for months.",
        "You\u2019ll have a definitive answer, once and for all.",
        "And if he\u2019s obviously lying, then you\u2019ll be able to see that, too.",
        "If you\u2019re really feeling bold, you can just flat-out ask him if he\u2019s cheating.",
        "Point to some shady behavior that has led you to feel this way.",
        "Ask your friends what they think.",
        "Though it\u2019s best to just ask him yourself, you can also get some great feedback from your friends, too.",
        "They\u2019ve been watching the situation unfold and may have a sense of what the relationship is like from the outside.",
        "They may even have a better sense of whether or not he\u2019s playing you because they might have seen him with girls without you and may have a different impression.",
        "Tell your friends to be honest with you.",
        "They shouldn\u2019t lie to you just to spare your feelings.",
        "They can investigate a bit if you really want them to.",
        "If it won\u2019t look too obvious, you can have one of your friends casually show up in a place where your guy is likely to be and to keep an eye on him to see how he is with other girls.",
        "Of course, if he thinks you\u2019ve sent a spy in his direction, he\u2019ll be on his best behavior.",
        "Consider following him.",
        "Okay, so if you really don\u2019t care about being found out or breaking his trust, then one thing you can do is to follow your guy after you\u2019ve been hanging out, or just when you know he\u2019ll be at a certain place, to see what he\u2019s been up to.",
        "Whether you\u2019re driving at a far distance away, walking, or taking the bus, try to be far enough away that he doesn\u2019t see you and to have a ready-made story in case he does catch you in the act.",
        "This can lead you to see if he\u2019s seeing any other girls\u2014or if he\u2019s just going home to hang out with his cat.",
        "Just know that this is pretty risky behavior that can lead you to get caught.",
        "If you\u2019re caught and he hasn\u2019t been doing anything wrong, this can be a relationship ender for you, so make sure you really think following him is a good idea before you begin.",
        "Show up at his place when he doesn\u2019t expect it.",
        "Another way to find out if he\u2019s playing you is to show up at his place unannounced.",
        "You can pop in an hour earlier than you said you\u2019d be there to see if there\u2019s a different woman there or if he\u2019s suspiciously cleaning everything up.",
        "You can also just drop by because you\u2019re \u201cin the area\u201d at a time when he\u2019s supposed to be studying or home working to bring him some coffee or a treat.",
        "When you show up, see if he\u2019s happy to see you or if he seems nervous, like he\u2019s hiding something\u2014or someone.",
        "Of course, if it\u2019s totally absurd that you would show up at his house out of the blue, then he\u2019ll be on to you.",
        "But if you\u2019ve come over there before and it hasn\u2019t been a big deal, just try to make it seem natural.",
        "Snoop through his things\u2014if you\u2019re okay with breaking his trust.",
        "Though snooping through your guy\u2019s things won\u2019t win you any trust points, if you\u2019re desperate and feel pretty sure that you want to cheat on him, then you can try looking through his phone or his email, or even looking through his room for suspicious items like female clothing that is obviously not yours.",
        "Snooping is a last resort and you should only do it if you feel like you really need answers and nothing else is working.",
        "The problem with snooping is that, even if you\u2019ve found evidence, you\u2019ll have to admit that you\u2019ve been going through the guy\u2019s things if you want to call him out.",
        "This will make him angry at you, and will take the focus off the real situation.",
        "If you\u2019re looking through his phone, have an excuse ready in case he catches you.",
        "You can say that your phone died and that you were looking up the restaurant where you two were having dinner or that you needed to quickly check your email or something.",
        "Though this may not be too convincing, it may be better than nothing.",
        "Try to catch him in a lie.",
        "You can also try to catch the guy in a lie to find out if he\u2019s playing you.",
        "If he\u2019s mentioned that he hung out with his friends or brother the other night, when you see them, you can ask about how the boy\u2019s night out went; if they look confused, then you may know that he lied.",
        "If he tells a story about how he had to stay home because his sister was having drama, you can ask him how she\u2019s feeling a few days later; if he acts like he has no idea what you\u2019re talking about, then it may be because he already forgot his own lie.",
        "You can even try asking him simple questions like which movie he saw if he went to the movies with his friends.",
        "If he looks embarrassed or clearly doesn\u2019t know the answer, then you\u2019ll know that he\u2019s playing you.",
        "Even if there\u2019s no proof, trust your gut.",
        "If you just get the feeling that the guy isn\u2019t sincere even though you can\u2019t find any proof of it through snooping, then it may be time to end the relationship.",
        "Maybe he\u2019s not seeing other girls, but he still can be playing with you just because he\u2019s not feeling it as much as you are.",
        "As long as you know you\u2019re not the one with jealousy issues and see that you have a real reason to be concerned, if you really think he might be playing you, then it\u2019s time to cut him loose.",
        "When you\u2019re with a guy who really cares for you and who is there for only you, you\u2019ll know.",
        "You won\u2019t spend hours calling him and wondering where he is and you won\u2019t have to stoop as low as snooping through his things or following him because you\u2019ll have no reason to do it.",
        "You\u2019ll know that he\u2019s there for you 100% and that will be an amazing feeling."
