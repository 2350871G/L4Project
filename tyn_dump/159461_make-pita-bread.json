How to Season Pita Bread Dough\nAdd a light seasoning to pita bread dough while you knead it with a few dashes of fresh ground pepper or dried herbs. Create garlicky pita bread by kneading in 3 to 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic. Make spiced pita bread by sprinkling 0.25 oz (7.1 g) of cinnamon into your dough as you knead it.
