                    "description": "If you\u2019re backpacking for a week or more, get a backpack that\u2019s at least 70 liters (18.5 gallons). If you\u2019ll only be backpacking for a few nights, a pack in the 30-50 liter (8-13 gallons) range will work. The longer your trip, the more you\u2019ll be packing. It\u2019s important that you get a larger backpack if you\u2019ll be gone for an extended period of time. Some backpacks are measured in cubic inches. As a rule of thumb, daypacks will mostly be under 2,500 cubic inches, while weekend packs are somewhere in the 2,500-4,000 cubic inch (40 to 65 liter) range. For week long trips, you will need around 4,000-6,000 cubic inches (65-95 liters) of space."

Look at the tag or product details for any backpack you're considering to find out what fit you should get based on these measurements. Some backpacks are sold in small, medium, and large sizes that correspond with different hip sizes and torso lengths. To find your torso length, measure from the bottom of your neck to the top of your hips. Measure your hip size by wrapping a tape measure around your hips, a little above where you wear your belts."

If you\u2019re backpacking for a week or more, get a backpack that\u2019s at least 70 liters (18.5 gallons). If you\u2019ll only be backpacking for a few nights, a pack in the 30-50 liter (8-13 gallons) range will work. The longer your trip, the more you\u2019ll be packing.

        "Get an internal-frame backpack for extra stability.",
        "Internal-frame backpacks have a built-in frame that will help you keep your balance on uneven trails.",

        "Go with a frameless backpack if you want something light.",

        "Choose a frameless bag if you\u2019re concerned about your pack being too heavy to carry.",
        "Frameless bags are usually cheaper than more advanced backpacking packs, making them a great option if you're on a budget.",
        "Look for a backpack with the right features for your trip.",
        "Some backpacks are more advanced than others.",
        "The features you\u2019ll need depend on the length of your trip and where you\u2019ll be backpacking.",

        "Extra padding.",
        "A backpack with extra padding on the straps and hip belts will help prevent you from getting sore during your trip.",
        "A rain cover.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about it raining during your trip, look for a backpack that comes with a rain cover.",
        "You can cover your backpack with the waterproof rain cover to keep the contents of your pack dry.",
        "Find a backpack made out of a durable, water-resistant material.",
        "You don't want your bag to tear or get soaked in the rain during your trip.",
        "Look for a bag made out of nylon, polyester, or a blend of the two.",
        "Borrow or buy a used backpack if you're on a budget.",
        "Ask a friend or family member if you can use their backpack for your trip if you can't afford a brand new one.",
        "You can also purchase a discounted used backpack online through websites like eBay and Craigslist.",
        "Try to find one that's the appropriate size and fit for you.",
        "Check that all the zippers on the backpack work and that there aren't any holes.",
        "You don't want to use a damaged backpack or your things could get lost or ruined.",
        "Packing Efficiently Organize all your gear before you pack.",
        "Lay everything out on the floor and make sure you\u2019re not forgetting anything.",
        "Group similar items together in piles so you can pack them together.",
        "If you have a lot of small, loose items, put them all together in a sealable bag so they\u2019re easy to find when you need them.",
        "For example, pack all of your bathroom stuff together so it's all in one place when you need it.",
        "Put loose batteries, first-aid items, and fire supplies in a sealable plastic bag so they don't get lost in your backpack.",
        "Leave behind unnecessary items.",
        "You want to be disciplined while packing your backpack so you don't bring more than you need.",
        "Avoid packing things like hair products, large cameras, pillows (use your backpack as a pillow instead), multiple pairs of shoes, and bulky blankets.",
        "Try to be as strict as possible with what you allow yourself to pack.",
        "Distribute the weight of the gear in your pack.",
        "This will make your backpack feel lighter and easier to carry.",
        "Pack your backpack so the lightest gear is at the bottom and the heaviest gear is in the middle and to the back of the bag where your back will be.",
        "Put the rest of the gear at the top of the backpack.",
        "Pack your clothes, sleeping pad, and sleeping bag at the bottom of your backpack.",
        "Put heavier items like flashlights, cans of food, and cooking supplies at the top of your backpack.",
