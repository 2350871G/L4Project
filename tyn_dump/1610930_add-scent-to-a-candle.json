        "The bottle will offer insights into how concentrated your particular oil is.",
        "Keep in mind that because essential oils are natural, they are more potent than fragrance oils so a little goes a long way.",
        "Let the beads rest.",
        "While you can light your candle immediately, for best results, allow the scent to absorb throughout the container and settle.",
        "Waiting 24-48 hours is best.",
        "If the container has a lid, cover it during this time.",
        "Light the candle.",
        "When ready, light the wick and enjoy your scent.",
        "Using Scented Cubes Purchase scented cubes.",
        "Scented cubes are small wax cubes with a powerful scent.",
        "Most large retailers carry scented cubes and there are hundreds to choose from.",
        "While most people place them on a warmer, causing them to melt and emit a smell, they can be used alongside candles.",
        "Light the candle.",
        "Using a candle of your choosing, let it burn for several minutes or until about an inch-deep pool of melted wax has accumulated around the wick.",
        "Once this happens, place the scented wax cube into the melted wax.",
        "The flame will help the scented wax continue to melt down and emit a strong smell that will fill up the room.",
        "Sense the wax cubes are so strong, consider cutting them in half using a butter knife.",
        "Continue to enjoy.",
        "The scented wax will melt to form a layer of wax.",
        "Every time you light this candle, the scented wax layer will continue to emit a smell for quite some time.",
        "Making a Scented Candle from Scratch Gather materials.",
        "To make your own candle, you will need a bag of soy wax flakes, one wick (more if making several candles), a glass container for the candle, a scented oil of your choosing, skewers and a glass measuring cup.",
        "You will be able to find these items at a craft store.",
        "Consider using palm or beeswax flakes as an alternative.",
        "Set the wick.",
        "Grab the container of your choice.",
        "This could be a glass bowl or a mason jar.",
        "Lay the metal end of the wick flat along the bottom of the container.",
        "Tape the top end of the wick to a skewer so that the wick is pulled completely straight.",
        "Lay the skewer on top of the container with the wick outstretched.",
        "If the wick is really long, simply cut it with scissors.",
        "It should reach slightly above the rim of the container.",
        "If a skewer isn't available, just about anything will work.",
        "Try using a kitchen utensil instead.",
        "Measure your wax flakes.",
        "Use a glass measuring cup for this.",
        "You will need twice the amount of wax flakes as the size of your container.",
        "For example, if your container measures one cup, pour two cups of wax flakes.",
        "If you're unsure about the size of your container, simply fill the container with water.",
        "Pour the water from the container into a measuring cup to have an exact measurement.",
        "Melt the wax.",
        "Fill a saucepan halfway with water.",
        "Then, set your glass measuring cup with wax flakes in the water.",
        "Make sure water isn't getting into the container.",
        "If it is, you will need to pour a little water out.",
        "Turn your heat to medium-high and stir the wax with a metal spoon or spatula.",
        "Once completely melted, turn the heat off.",
        "This will only take a few minutes.",
        "Add scent.",
        "Using an essential oil, add about 10 drops into the melted wax.",
        "This will create a moderately scented candle.",
        "For a stronger scent, add more drops.",
        "Stir the wax and scent slowly using a toothpick or metal spoon.",
        "Remember that you can replace the essential oil with a fragrance oil or scented cube, if that's more readily available.",
        "Each bottle of oil will have specific instructions regarding number of drops, follow these guidelines for best results.",
        "Pour the wax into the container.",
        "Use an oven mitt to hold the glass measuring cup.",
        "Hold the skewer so the wick doesn't shift while pouring.",
        "Slowly pour the scented wax into the container.",
        "Let the wax sit and cool for 3-4 hours.",
        "Burn the candle.",
        "After the candle is completely solidified, remove the skewer.",
        "Feel free to burn your scented candle and enjoy.",
        "These make excellent, inexpensive gifts as well."
