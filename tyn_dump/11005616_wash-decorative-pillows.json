This tag will typically tell you how to wash both the pillow and the cover, although if the cover is removable, it may have a separate tag. If your pillow doesn\u2019t have a care tag, look at the materials to determine how to clean the separate parts. Try looking online if you're not sure how to clean a specific fabric. For instance, if your cover is made from denim, you'd probably be fine putting in the washing machine, but if it's delicate silk, you'd need to dry clean it."

                    "description": "Often, decorative pillows will consist of an inner pillow and a removable cover. The cover may overlap in the back, similar to a pillow sham, or it may have a hidden zipper. If you can, remove this cover and wash it separately according to the care tag\u2019s instructions. If it's safe to machine or hand-wash, use mild laundry detergent. If you can\u2019t remove the cover, you'll probably need to wash the whole thing. Take the cover material and the fill into consideration when you're deciding which cleaning method to use. For example, even if you have a machine-washable cover made from a material like cotton, denim, or polyester, but the fill is memory foam, you'd need to spot-clean it because of the fill material. If the cover is made from a delicate material like silk, wool, or velvet, or if it has a lot of decorative trim, it probably needs to be dry cleaned, or you can spot clean it if you just need to clean a small stain."
