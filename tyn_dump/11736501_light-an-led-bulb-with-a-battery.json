                    "description": "Regular-sized light bulbs, like those used in lamps or ceiling fixtures, typically require 120V or more to run them. A normal household battery won\u2019t provide enough power to light these larger types of bulbs up. You can use a small LED bulb from a flashlight, for example. To power a higher voltage light bulb, you would need to string together multiple batteries of 12V or higher, which isn\u2019t safe to do for this experiment as you could get an electrical shock.The instructions below are for LED bulbs.If you follow those steps using a regular LED, remember they are polarized. Always connect the longest leg to the positive terminal of the battery and the shortest leg to the negative terminal. Else the LED won't light or could be damaged. Do not use a battery with a voltage over 3V, else your LED might explode."

You can use any standard household battery, such as a AA, AAA, C or D battery, which are all 1.5V batteries. You could also just hold the wire in place if you don\u2019t have any electrical tape to temporarily connect them. There is no risk of getting electrocuted by such a low voltage."

You can also try this experiment with just 1 wire by touching the light bulb directly to 1 of the batteries terminals for 1 of the connections.
