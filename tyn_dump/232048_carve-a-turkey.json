This type of fork will hold the turkey firmly without damaging the meat, giving you total control over the carving and slicing. Some people like to use two knives. They will use the carving knife for slicing the turkey into thin strips and a cook's knife to divide the bird into joints."

Removing the Wishbone Remove a little skin from the neck-end of the turkey's breast. This will enable you to see the actual turkey meat, so that you can remove the wishbone. Poke into the cavity with your finger, feeling around for the wishbone. Once you've found it, cut around the V-shaped wishbone as close as possible Grasp the wishbone carefully and remove it from the turkey. Try to avoid damaging the meat or breaking the wishbone. Allow the wishbone to dry for a few days, and then use it to make a wish. Two people hold the wishbone, one holding each end, and make a silent wish. They then pull the bone apart and whoever gets the longer piece will have their wish come true. In some traditions, the person who gets the shorter piece will be the first to marry. Carving the Legs Carve the legs. Cut along the turkey's hip joint with your knife, letting the leg slowly separate from the body of the turkey. Remove the leg completely from the joint once you view the separation. The joint should snap free. If not, it can easily be cut with your knife. Don't be afraid to use a little force. Remove as much meat as you can. Carve close to the body, especially near the turkey's back. Note the succulent orb of meat at the base of the back, called the oyster. Consume it as the cook's reward! Cut the leg at its knee joint. An easy way to find the joint is by feeling with your finger. It should cut easily. Slice the thigh meat by holding it firmly to the cutting surface with a fork. Cut slices parallel to the bone. This task can be assigned to someone else to save time while you move on to carve other parts of the turkey. Repeat this process on the other leg. On the serving platter, you may want to keep the sections together to cater to everyone's favorite part of the bird. Carving the Breasts Cut into the bird alongside of its breastbone. Use it as a guide for your knife. You'll have two large sections both busting full of scrumptious meat. Angle the knife and cut the meat away from the carcass. This will cut through the wing joint. At this point, all the meat should be off the body. The breast should come easily away from the body, moist and tender. Repeat for the other side. Cut off the wing tips from the breasts.
