Always get a proper pet cage, hutch, or tank. Guinea pigs and rabbits can have hutches or cube and coroplast cages. Hamsters and mice can live in wire cages. Fish live in tanks or aquariums. Some fish will require aquarium lights. Reptiles live in glass terrariums. They will need a basking lamp with a UVB lightbulb. Hide the cage in a corner or closet. You can place the cage in a corner and arrange your furniture around it so that it cannot be seen. Similarly, if your closet is big enough, you can try fitting it there. Be sure to leave your closet door slightly open so there is plenty of air getting to your pets. Some pets do not like being in the dark constantly. Leave a closet light on, or make sure that there is a small light attached to your cage. Place the cage on a high shelf. Few cages are small enough to fit under a bed, but you may be able to keep it out of view on a shelf. Make sure you that you can easily reach the cage without trouble. Use books and other items to hide the cage on the shelf. This works best for smaller cages, such as hamster cages, reptile terrariums, or small fish bowls. Cover the cage with a blanket. If you have a guinea pig cage or rabbit hutch, you can drape a blanket over the cage to hide most of it. Make sure that there is at least one wire/mesh wall free so your pets can breathe and look out. If the cage can support it, place light objects, such as notebooks or jewelry boxes, on top to disguise it. If you have a fish tank, a wire hamster cage, or a reptile terrarium, this is not a good idea, as the top may need to be left open for oxygen, lamp wires, or exercise. Clean the cage every week. You should scoop out any poop every day, but at least once a week, do a thorough cleaning. Remove your pet into a separate box or cage. Scoop out the hay or litter into a plastic garbage bag. Take it to the curb immediately. Wash the cage down with dish soap and water or a mixture of vinegar and water. Let it dry, refill with shavings, and put your pet back in. If you have a reptile in a terrarium, be sure to spray down the glass with a disinfectant. If you have a fish, take the fish out to another bowl or a cooler full of water. Scoop out any debris, and replace the water with fresh before returning the fish to the bowl. Turn off lights at night. For pets that need light, you can switch off the light when it gets dark. Most reptiles need sunlight during the day but complete darkness during the night. The same goes for most types of fish. You can give them a few hours of light at night before shutting off their aquarium light.This is convenient for you as it ensures that your parents will not be alerted by any lights at night time. Always double check the guidelines for the specific breeds or species you own. Some need more light than others, and some may require light at night. Revealing Your Pet Clean your pet's bedding or cage. When you show your parents your pet, you'll want to put its best face forward. If possible, give your pet a bath. Clean out their cage, and wash their bedding. Make sure that their room is tidy. If your parents see that the animal is well cared for, they may be more likely to let you keep it. Find an alternate home. Just in case your parents say no, make sure you have your back-up plan all set. Find a friend or relative who is willing to take your pet for you. Offer them all of the necessary pet supplies. Avoid taking your pets to a shelter unless you have no other option. Practice what you will say. You want to make sure you appear mature and collected when you show your parents your pet. Since this can be an emotional topic, write down what you want to tell them. Try saying it in front of the mirror a few times. Sit down with your parents. The best time to talk to your parents is at home when no one is distracted. Tell your parents that you want to talk, and ask them to sit down with you. Do not tell them as they are driving, cooking, or cleaning. You may be able to talk with them over dinner. Be careful about approaching them right after they get home from work. They may be tired and stressed out. Wait for them to relax before you talk to them. Tell them. Be honest and straightforward. Let them know how well you have taken care of the pet. If they haven't noticed, point out that the pet is not as noisy or smelly as they may have thought. Acknowledge that you broke the rules, and apologize for it. Ask them if you can keep the pet. Promise to take care of the pet yourself. For example, you can say,  \"I found a cat that needed a home. For the last two weeks, I have cared for the cat in my bedroom. She is very sweet, and I have taken care of her all by myself. I hope to continue caring for her. I know I have broken your trust, but please, can I keep her?\" If your parents say no, you have to live with consequences. Give the pet to another home along with all of their bedding, toys, and food. You may be grounded or punished. Show your parents the pet. Bring your pet out to show them. Let them hold and touch your pet. If they form an emotional bond with the pet, your parents may be more likely to let you keep it.",
