In other words, it's better to have $10 today than $10 one year in the future because you can invest your $10 today and have more than $10 in a year. For NPV calculations, you need to know the interest rate of an investment account or opportunity with a similar level of risk to the investment you're analyzing. This is called your \"discount rate\" and is expressed as a decimal, rather than a percent. In corporate finance, a firm's weighted-average cost of capital is often used to determine the discount rate. In simpler situations, you can usually just use the return rate on a savings account, stock investment, etc. that you might put your money in instead of making the investment you're analyzing.

        "Simply use the formula PV = FV / (1+i), where i is your discount rate, t the number of time periods being analyzed, FV is the future money value, and PV is the present value.",
        "If you know i, t, and either FV or PV, it's relatively simple to solve for the final variable.",
        "For instance, let's say we want to know how much $1,000 will be worth in five years.",
        "If we know that, at bare minimum, we can get a return rate of 2% on this money, we'll use 0.02 for i, 5 for t, and 1,000 for PV and solve for FV as follows:\n1,000 = FV / (1+0.02)\n1,000 = FV / (1.02)\n1,000 = FV / 1.104\n1,000 \u00d7 1.104 = FV = $1,104.",
        "Research valuation methods for more accurate NPVs.",
        "The accuracy of any NPV calculation basically depends on the accuracy of the values you use for your discount rate and your future cash inflows.",
        "If your discount rate is close to the actual return rate you can get on your money for an alternative investment of similar risk and your future cash inflows are close to the amounts of money you'll actually make from your investment, your NPV calculation will be right on the money."
