Fold the bag not quite in half width wise (with the fold perpendicular to the seam you cut off). Let one of the edges stick out about 1 inch/2.5 cm. Fold the part you already folded in half, repeating until the folded part is also about 1 inch/2.5 cm wide. Cut off the handles.  About every inch or 2.5 cm, cut the folded part of the bag with vertical slits. Make sure you cut all the way through the folded part, but try not to cut into the unfolded part of the bag. Grab the unfolded part of the bag, and shake gently. The folded part will unroll into a fringe. Open up the unfolded part of the bag and spread flat. It helps to slide in a piece of cardboard or a cardboard tube under the unfolded part so that you don't accidentally cut through the fringe area. Make a cut from the center (width wise) of the unfolded part to the nearest cut, diagonally.  Keep cutting across the unfolded part, diagonally, connecting the different cuts.
