A paint scraper or metal putty knife may also do the trick. Scrape off peeling paint and powdery, flaking rust until the surface is mostly smooth. You don\u2019t need to get down to bare metal. You just need to get rid of peeling or flaking rust and old paint, which prevent new coats of paint from bonding.

You might even need to use a grinder if the rust is really deep. Then, coat the piece in a primer that will inhibit rust, and paint over that.\""
