Set a large mixing bowl or pitcher on a sturdy work surface. Take the strainer and put it on top of a bowl or pitcher with tall sides so your juice doesn\u2019t drip over the sides. You can buy fine-mesh strainers from kitchen or restaurant supply stores. If the strainer doesn\u2019t fit over the pitcher without hanging over the sides, set a funnel on top of the pitcher first before putting the bowl on it."
