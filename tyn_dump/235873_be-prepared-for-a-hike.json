Walk at a comfortable pace where you can still hold a conversation without breathing heavily. Start with walks that are about 30\u201360 minutes long so you don\u2019t get too worn out. Take a rest day between walks so you don\u2019t get any sprains. At least once a week, go on a walk that\u2019s 2 hours or longer so you can build your stamina. By the time you go on your hike, you should be comfortable going on walks that last 4\u20136 hours.Try walking on different terrains since hiking trails aren\u2019t usually paved. Track how far you walk using your phone or smartwatch so you know your pace. Take the stairs whenever you can so you get used to climbing elevation.Tip: Make sure your heel strikes the ground first when you step down to prevent shin splints and pulled tendons. Practice cardio exercises to help increase your stamina. Even though going for a walk is a cardio exercise, try doing something that\u2019s more high-intensity a few times a week. Focus on cardio exercises that work your legs, such as running, cycling, soccer, or swimming. Work on your cardio at least 2\u20133 times a week on top of your walks.Include high-intensity cardio in your walks. For example, you could jog for 10\u201320 minutes in the middle of your walk to raise your heart rate. Incorporate squats and lunges into your workout to strengthen your legs. Keep your back straight and feet shoulder-width apart. To do a squat, bend your knees until they\u2019re at a 90-degree angle. Hold the position for a count before standing up again. If you want to do a lunge, step forward with 1 leg and bend your knees at 90-degree angles. Push yourself back up to a standing position. Do 2\u20133 sets that are 10 reps each.Working out your legs prevents them from getting sore and exhausted while you\u2019re in the middle of your hike. Hold dumbbells while performing squats or lunges if you want to build more muscle. Exercise your core to improve your balance. You\u2019ll have to carry hiking gear and supplies, so it may be difficult to keep your balance on uneven trails. Try doing 10\u201320 sit-ups or holding a plank position for 30 seconds to help you build up your core. Aim to do 2\u20133 sets of each exercise at least 2\u20133 times per week. Try foot exercises to prevent sprains and aches. Spread a towel flat on the floor and set your foot on top of it. Keep your heel still and grab the towel with your toes. Pull the towel closer toward your heel before stretching your foot out again. Do this 5 times with each foot. You can also pick up marbles with your toes and drop them into a cup as an alternative way to stretch your arches.If your feet get sore, lay a cold bottle horizontal on the floor and roll your foot over it. Eat a meal with carbs and protein before your hike. Carbs and protein help give your body energy so you don\u2019t get exhausted while you\u2019re out on your hike. Opt for something like oatmeal, eggs, pasta, and lean meat since they\u2019re nutritious. Incorporate fruits and vegetables into your meal as well for additional carbs and natural sugars.Avoid overeating since you may feel uncomfortable while you\u2019re out hiking.",
