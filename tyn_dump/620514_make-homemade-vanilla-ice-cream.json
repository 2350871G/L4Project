Don't be fooled by the plumpness of the bean -- a plump bean doesn't automatically equal more flavor, it may just have a high water content. If the bean smells smoky, this means the bean was not left to dry out properly, rather it was quickly flash dried over a fire.

When the mixture has cooled fully, add in the vanilla extract, cover the bowl, and place in the refrigerator. Leave for several hours or overnight, if possible. There are three main types of vanilla extract: Bourbon, Tahitian and Mexican. Each has a slightly different flavor. Bourbon vanilla is from Madagascar and has a strong, bold flavor; Tahitian vanilla is floral, while real Mexican vanilla is creamy-tasting, with a pronounced flavor. Always use a vanilla essence with an alcohol base. The alcohol, even if burned off during cooking, enhances the flavor of the vanilla extract. For a lighter custard, you can replace the heavy cream with half-and-half. Just be aware that your ice cream will turn out less smooth as a result."
