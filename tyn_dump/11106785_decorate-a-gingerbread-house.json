                    "description": "To decorate a gingerbread house, you're going to need a lot of icing. The best type of icing to use is royal icing because it dries hard and is long lasting \u2013 perfect for keeping your gingerbread house put together throughout the holiday season. You can make your own royal icing, or you can purchase it from a baking company or grocery store. Some stores sell royal icing in a variety of colors. You may want to use white icing for snow, green icing for Christmas trees, and red and blue icing for colorful lights. If you can't find any or want to make your own colors, purchase some soft gel paste food coloring. To make different colors, pour your icing into separate bowls. Add 1-2 drops of your preferred food coloring, and then mix it with a spoon until the colors are evenly distributed. If you want to make the color darker, add a couple more drops and mix it again."

All you need to do is put the icing you're going to use inside the bag, and squeeze it from the top until the icing comes out of the tip. Piping bags can be purchased at most grocery stores, or you can make your own using plastic bags or parchment paper. If you're using multiple piping bags during your gingerbread decorating, lay a damp towel over the tips of the piping bags to prevent the icing from hardening. To create different effects with your piping bags, you can buy some with various tip shapes and sizes. For example, some piping bags have round tips that create a clean dot of icing, while other piping bags have star tips that create a more detailed icing dot."
