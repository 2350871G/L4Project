Fusible bonding web can be used to mend wholes in many different kinds of fabrics\u2014cotton, blends, polyester, and even silk. Cut a piece of fusible bonding web that is slightly larger than the hole. Use a pair of scissors to cut a square or circle of bonding web that is about \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) bigger than the actual area you\u2019re repairing. The smaller the piece of bonding web, the less likely it\u2019ll be visible from the outside of the garment once it has been fixed. Fusible bonding web melts when it comes into contact with heat. It gets sandwiched between the garment and another piece of material and essentially bonds that fabric back together as it melts. Fusible bonding web is also often used for bigger tears to hold the fabric together while you add stitching to secure the area even more, so it can come in handy for many different repairs. Buy fusible bonding web online or from your local craft store. Layer a slightly larger piece of sew-in stabilizer over the bonding web. Cut out a piece of sew-in stabilizer that is \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) larger than the piece of fusible bonding web. Set it carefully over top of the bonding web so the web is neatly layered between the garment and the stabilizer. Sew-in stabilizer doesn\u2019t change consistency when it\u2019s heated, so it won\u2019t wrinkle or distort your garment. It provides a layer of protection so that the webbing doesn\u2019t stick to your iron. You could also use interfacing in place of stabilizer. Put a press cloth over the prepared garment on your ironing board. In case the sew-in stabilizer is dislodged, the cloth will protect your iron from the sticky bonding web. If you don\u2019t have a press cloth, any scrap of fabric will do. Even a tea towel will work well as a press cloth. If it\u2019s especially thick, just keep in mind that it\u2019ll take the heat from the iron a little longer to get through to the bonding web. Set the iron face-down over the hole or tear for 10 seconds. Set your iron to medium heat. Don\u2019t move the iron back and forth like you would if you were smoothing out wrinkles. Instead, just let it sit directly overtop of the sandwiched bonding web so it will melt and fuse the fabric back together. If you\u2019re using a thicker press cloth, leave the iron in place for 15-20 seconds. Flip the garment right-side-out, press the hole together, and iron it again. Remove the press cloth and give the garment a minute so it isn\u2019t hot to the touch. Then, turn it inside out and press the hole together with your fingertips. Set the iron down on the hole for an additional 10 seconds. Once your garment is fixed, you can wear and launder it just like you did before. The hole should be nearly invisible and protected from getting bigger. Making Minor Repairs Sew a popped button back into place quickly with needle and thread. Thread your needle and position the button back in place from where it popped off. Examine the other buttons on the garment to see if they\u2019re sewn on with a cross-stitch or a straight-stitch. Pull the needle up through the buttonhole and pass it back down through the other buttonhole. Make 3-4 stitches through each hole to secure the button, then tie the thread and clip it off. For this repair, you\u2019ll need a needle, thread that matches the garment, and a pair of scissors. A thimble may also come in handy so you don\u2019t accidentally prick a fingertip. A cross-stitch is when the thread crosses from a top hole on one side to the bottom hole on the opposite side. In a straight-stitch, the thread passes through the top and bottom holes on the same side of the button or the two top holes and two bottom holes. Fix a broken zipper yourself instead of replacing the garment. There are several different problems you could run into with a zipper. It could simply be stuck, or it could have come apart completely. Luckily, there are ways to address each of those issues:\nReplace the slider to fix a zipper that won\u2019t stay closed even after the garment has been zipped. You could also use a pair of pliers to pinch the existing slider so it is tighter and see if that fixes the problem. Check either side of the zipper for stuck fabric or thread if your zipper won\u2019t open or shut. If you can\u2019t pull the blockage out by hand, use a thin needle to poke the material out of the zipper's jaws. Remove pilling with scissors to keep your clothes looking fresh. Use a pair of scissors to trim away pills, or you could also use a special sweater comb and stroke the fabric with the comb to gently pull off the pills. To help prevent pilling, try washing items inside out, use the delicate cycle, and hang-dry your clothes. Avoid pulling the pills off with your fingers. This is tempting and seems easy, but it actually promotes more pilling! Get rid of deodorant stains on clothes with baking soda and vinegar. Sprinkle baking soda over the deodorant stain and then saturate the area with white vinegar. Scrub the stain gently with a soft brush before washing it like you normally would. You may need to do this 2-3 times to fully get rid of the stain. If this is a consistent problem you see on your dark clothes, consider switching to a spray or gel deodorant. They\u2019re less likely to stain. Distress your jeans to turn worn patches into intentional design spots. Grab a pumice stone and rub it back and forth in a circular motion over the sections you want to make more distressed until the denim starts to shred. Once the denim begins to separate, you can pull the threads apart by hand to make the patches look even more distressed. This trick works especially well with worn-out knees. You could extend the distressed section up over your thighs, or even add a few patches to the front or back pockets. Fix a gaping neckline to refresh your favorite tops. Turn the garment inside out and loosen the seams connecting the shoulders to the body of the shirt. Take in the neckline by \u20444 to \u20442 inch (0.64 to 1.27 cm) on each side, depending on how widely the neckline is gaping. Stitch the shoulder seam back in place with a matching thread. If there is a lot of excess fabric left after you\u2019ve sewn the seams, you may want to trim them away so they don\u2019t create a bulge underneath the shirt.",
