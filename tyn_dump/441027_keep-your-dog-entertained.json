A 20-minute walk daily is recommended for most breeds of dogs. Working dogs may need two 20-minute walks a day. Make a busy bucket for your dog.

        "Dog parks also offer plenty of opportunity for sensory stimulation, as there is plenty to see and smell.",

        "For dogs, one minute of swimming is the equivalent of four minutes of running!",

        "If your weekend plans include meeting up with friends for a meal or a drink, don\u2019t leave your canine friend behind!",

        "Dogs (especially puppies) are very social creatures, and need plenty of time to interact with their own species.",
        "Make sure that you find a play companion for your pup who is around the same size and temperament as your dog, so that both dogs stay safe, and enjoy their time together.",
        "Introduce your dog to new buddies on neutral territory (while on a walk or at a park), so that the dogs don\u2019t feel like they need to defend their home turf from stranger dogs.",
        "Play fetch at the park.",
        "All you need to keep your dog entertained for hours at the park is a tennis ball or Frisbee.",

        "Stop at rest stops for walks and bathroom breaks.",
        "Most rest areas along highways offer places to walk dogs, and some even have fenced-in areas to allow your canine friend a safe place to run around.",
        "Bring along some new toys as well.",
        "Before you venture out on a trip with your dog, buy some new toys and mix them in with some old familiar favorites.",
