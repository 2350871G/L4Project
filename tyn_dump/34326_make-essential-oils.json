        "Generally, plants that are in whole form (not crushed or powdered) are best.",
        "While distillation removes many impurities, pesticides and herbicides can contaminate your oil.",
        "It\u2019s best to use organically grown plants, whether you purchase them or grow your own.",
        "Dry the plant material.",
        "Drying reduces the amount of oil in each plant, but can greatly increase how much essential oil you make per batch.",
        "This is because you\u2019ll be able to fit more material into each batch.",
        "Drying should be done slowly and away from direct sunlight.",
        "Commercially grown plants such as lavender and peppermint may be allowed to dry in the field after cutting for a day or so.",
        "The ideal drying method varies from plant to plant, but in general, you shouldn\u2019t overheat the plants.",
        "Drying in the shade or even in a dark room minimizes the oil loss.",
        "Don\u2019t allow the plants to become wet again before distillation.",
        "Distill as soon as possible after drying.",
        "You can choose not to dry your plant material if you\u2019d like to skip this step.",
        "Distilling Your Essential Oil Pour water into the tank of your still.",
        "If you made your own still, your tank is the pressure cooker.",
        "Use clean water; it should be ideally filtered or distilled and as soft as possible.",
        "If you're using a manufactured still, follow the manufacturer's direction.",
        "Otherwise, just make sure you have enough water to complete the distillation.",
        "Depending on the plant and on the quantity, distillation can take anywhere from a half-hour to six hours or more after the water boils.",
        "Add your plant matter to the water.",
        "Fit as much plant matter as the tank can contain.",
        "As long as you have enough water to last without boiling off, your plants should be fine even if they\u2019re packed in tight.",
        "Just make sure that they don\u2019t block the steam outlet in the lid of the pressure cooker.",
        "Give yourself a couple inches of leeway.",
        "You don\u2019t need to chop or otherwise prepare the plant in any way \u2014 in fact, doing so will cause you to lose some of the oils.",
        "Bring the pressure cooker to a boil.",
        "Seal the lid so that the only steam that escapes must travel through the pipe that\u2019s attached to the steam valve.",
        "Most plants will release their essential oils at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 the normal boiling point of water.",
        "Keep an eye on the still.",
        "After a while, the distillate should begin to come through your condenser and into your separator.",
        "The process should be fairly hands-off, but you want to make sure you don\u2019t run out of water in your still.",
        "Depending on the length of the distillation process, you may also need to change the water in the cold-water tub.",
        "If the hot pipe warms the water up, replace it with fresh cold water or ice so that the cooling process continues to work.",
        "Filter the collected oil (optional).",
        "Once your distillation is complete, you might choose filter the oil through cheesecloth or similar dry cotton fabric.",
        "Make sure that the cloth is dry and clean \u2014 detergent residues and dirt can contaminate the oil.",
        "Don\u2019t be disappointed that you get a very small amount of essential oil from a large amount of plant matter.",
        "Percent yields vary from species to species, but they\u2019re always lower than a beginning distiller might think.",
        "Pour the oil into a container for storage as quickly as possible.",
        "Most essential oils can be kept for at least one or two years, but some have very short shelf lives.",
        "To maximize the useful life of your oil, keep it in a dark glass bottle or stainless steel container.",
        "Use a clean funnel to pour the oil into the container, and make sure the container is clean before pouring the oil into it.",
        "Store it in a cool, dark place.",
        "Decide what to do with the hydrosol as well.",
        "The other material in the essencier is hydrosol \u2014 water that\u2019s been distilled and infused with the scent of the plant.",
        "Some hydrosols, like rose or lavender water are usable themselves.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to save the hydrosol, you can pour it into the still for the next batch if you will be distilling another batch immediately.",
        "Otherwise, throw it out."
