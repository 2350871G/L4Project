Use a picture of a butterfly to help you choose a wing design and copy it as best you can. Or find a free butterfly wing pattern online and print it out. Cut out your paper template using a sharp pair of scissors.Tip: If you are making this costume with a small child, make sure someone responsible and older is cutting. If you are making your own template, measure from fingertip to fingertip and divide this number in half to determine how wide to make the wing template. Then, measure from your shoulder to the middle of your thigh to determine how long to make the template. You only need to draw or print 1 wing to use as your template."

Place the template onto the fabric so that the inner or flat edge of the wing template is lined up with the fold. Place a pin every 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) along the edges. Be sure that the fabric is no too heavy or bulky if you are wearing the costume for extended periods of time, like trick-or-treating or at a party. Insert the pins so that they are perpendicular to the edges of the template.Tip: You can use any type of fabric you like to create your wings. For a quick, easy, and cheap pair of butterfly wings, trace the paper template onto a plastic garbage bag and then use orange and white plastic pieces to decorate the wings."

Try using black, orange, and white for a monarch butterfly look. Go with different shades of 1 color, such as dark blue, royal blue, and light blue for a monochromatic look. Choose several bright or pastel colors for a rainbow effect."

                    "description": "If the template you used includes various shapes, then you can use these to cut out fabric pieces that you can glue onto your wings. If the wing template does not include shapes, you can draw your own using an image of butterfly wings as your guide. Cut out teardrops and dots and attach them to the wing with fabric glue. Position the teardrops in the middle of the wings with the pointed ends facing in and place the dots along the outer edges. To attach the shapes you can use hot glue, fabric glue, or needle and thread. Make sure that whatever you do use to attach the embellishments is durable. Butterflies usually have intricate patterns on their wings, but don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t replicate it exactly. Gluing a variety of shapes to the wing will create the desired effect."

Use fabric glue to attach items to the wings where you want them to go. Let the glue dry for 8 hours or overnight before you move or wear the wings.Tip: You may decorate 1 or both sides of the wings depending on how you want the costume to look. Decorating both sides will ensure that the colors will be visible from the front and the back. However, only decorating 1 side might make your costume a little more mysterious. Keep in mind that if you decorate both sides, your body will cover up a portion of the front, so don't decorate there."
