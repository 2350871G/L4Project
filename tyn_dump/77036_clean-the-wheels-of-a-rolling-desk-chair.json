Lay out a plastic sheet underneath your rolling desk chair. Flip your chair upside down. It\u2019s easier to work with the wheels of your chair when they are elevated and fully exposed. Remove the wheels. Most rolling desk chair wheels can be removed by simply pulling on them. However, some models require a screwdriver or wrench in order to remove the wheels. If the wheels of your chair cannot be removed, remove the base or legs of the chair from the upper seat portion. Cleaning the Inside of the Wheels Use your fingers to remove visible debris. Remove any small objects, stickers or larger pieces of debris that can easily be removed by hand. Use tools to help remove stuck debris. If any debris seems stuck, grab a pair of tweezers to remove it. Other tools to help remove debris include scissors, nail clippers, bottle cutters and screwdrivers. Use duct tape to remove small pieces of debris. Cut a strip of duct tape so that it can fit inside the wheel. Pat the piece of duct tape into the wheel so that the sticky tape can trap the small pieces of dirt. Once the dirt has attached to the piece of tape, remove the tape from the wheel and discard it. Vacuum the wheels. Use a vacuum to capture any small pieces of dirt or debris that could not be picked up with tape. Ensure you are using a smaller vacuum attachment for easier access. Cleaning the Outside of the Wheels Use a scrub brush to remove debris. Scrub the outside of the wheel with a strong scrub brush. You may want to lightly soak the brush in soapy water. Use a butter knife to remove stubborn stuck on debris. Hold the knife so that it is parallel to the wheel. Slice in the direction that the wheel spins. Soak the wheels in water and soap. Allow the wheels to soak in a soapy water mixture for at least 10 minutes. You may use a brush to continue scrubbing them while they soak.
