                    "description": "A habitat this big can comfortably house between 1 and 3 ferrets. Go with an enclosure or hutch for small animals, such as a large rabbit hutch. You can also opt to build the enclosure yourself out of wooden frames and mesh panel siding if you have construction experience. You can buy this type of outdoor enclosure from most large pet supply stores, such as PetSmart or Pet Supplies Plus. Building the enclosure yourself is a little difficult, so if you don\u2019t have any construction experience, your best bet is to buy a pre-made enclosure. Avoid buying or building an enclosure smaller than 6 by 6 by 6 feet (1.8 by 1.8 by 1.8 m). Your ferrets will not be happy with their outdoor home if they feel cramped in it. If you plan to house more than 3 ferrets in your outdoor enclosure, add 2 feet (0.61 m) to each dimension for each additional ferret. For example, if your habitat will house 4 ferrets, go with an enclosure that measures 8 by 8 by 8 feet (2.4 by 2.4 by 2.4 m)."
