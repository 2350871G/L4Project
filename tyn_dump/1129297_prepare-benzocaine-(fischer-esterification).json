    "text": " Add a magnetic stir bar, 1.0g of p-aminobenzoic acid, and 10mL of absolute ethanol to a round bottom flask.  Swirl the mixture until the solid is completely dissolved.  Add 1mL of concentrated sulfuric acid drop wise with a Pasteur pipette to the ethanol-aminobenzoic solution. A solid will precipitate out of the solution. Remember, sulfuric acid is very corrosive and can cause serious chemical burns if allowed to come into contact with your skin. Use extreme caution when handling this chemical. Attach a condenser to the round bottom flask containing the ethanol solution, and set up the apparatus for heating under reflux. The water-in tube attaches to the bottom spigot of the condenser and water-out tube attaches to the top spigot of the condenser. Heat the solution on a hot plate under gentle reflux for approximately 30 minutes. Set the heat to 2 initially and the stir to 6-7. You may need to adjust the heat to keep the solution refluxing, but not boiling violently. You know the solution is refluxing when liquid droplets form at the tip of the condenser where the condenser is attached to the round bottom flask. If any solid precipitate remains after heating, take the condenser off of the round bottom flask and remove the round bottom flask from the hot plate. Cool the solution at room temperature for 2-3 minutes. Add 3mL of absolute ethanol and 0.5mL of sulfuric acid (by drop) to the round bottom flask containing the solution and precipitate. Reattach the condenser to the round bottom flask, and resume heating under gentle reflux until all of the solid has dissolved. It is very important for this experiment to succeed that ALL of the solids dissolve during this period. Once the solid is completely dissolved, continue heating the solution under gentle reflux for another 30 minutes.  Remove the round bottom flask from the heat source and allow the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature. This should take between 7-10 minutes. Fill a 100mL beaker with 30mL of water and pour the cooled reaction mixture into the beaker containing the 30mL of water.  Basify the reaction mixture and water solution to a pH of about 8. To do this, calculate the approximate volume of 10% aqueous sodium carbonate required to neutralize the total amount of sulfuric acid you used (Usually between 18-24 mL). Slowly pour the calculated amount of 10% aqueous sodium carbonate into the beaker containing the reaction mixture and water solution. Be sure to add the sodium carbonate slowly as frothing occurs during neutralization. A solid should precipitate. This is crude benzocaine. Assemble your vacuum filtration apparatus and collect the crude benzocaine via vacuum filtration.  Weigh the crude benzocaine collected during vacuum filtration.  Transfer the crude benzocaine to a 50mL Erlenmeyer flask and add a magnetic stir bar and 20mL of water  Place the Erlenmeyer flask on a hot plate and set the heat to 2-3 and the stir to 6-7. Heat the benzocaine-water mixture to about 60 \u00b0C (140 \u00b0F). You can measure the temperature by placing the thermometer adapter onto the top of condenser and sliding the thermometer through the condenser until the thermometer's tip rests 1 to 2 centimeters (0.4 to 0.8 in) above the liquid in the round bottom flask. Add enough methanol to the heated solution to dissolve the benzocaine solid. This step should only require 5-10mL of methanol. Do not add more methanol than is necessary to dissolve the solid. Remove the Erlenmeyer flask from the heat source once all the solid dissolves, and allow the solution to cool to room temperature. This should take 7-10 minutes. Cool the solution in an ice water bath for 15 minutes to complete crystallization of the benzocaine.  Use vacuum filtration to isolate the crystallized benzocaine  Weigh the final product and calculate the percent yield.  Obtain an IR spectra of your final product for comparison against an authentic sample. ",
