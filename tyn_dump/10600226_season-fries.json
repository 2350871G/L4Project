                    "description": "Use about 2 \u20442 lb (1.1 kg) of Russet potatoes for a batch of fries. Remove the skins with a potato peeler, then use a sharp chef\u2019s knife to slice all the potatoes in half. Cut the halves into sticks about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) wide and \u20444 in (0.64 cm) thick. Russet potatoes and sweet potatoes hold their shape well, making them the best options for fries. Other types, including red potatoes, are usable, but keep a close eye on them as they cook to prevent them from falling apart."

When you\u2019re done, drain the water and pat the potatoes dry with a paper towel. The water removes excess starch, leading to crispier fries. To prevent the potatoes from browning, leave them in the water as you prepare the other ingredients. This usually isn\u2019t necessary, but it helps if you aren\u2019t able to fry them right away."

Use a kitchen thermometer to ensure the oil reaches a hot enough temperature. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, dip a wooden spoon into the oil to test it. Hot oil will continue to bubble steadily despite the spoon. Another way to get a good fry is to add the oil to a tabletop deep fryer. Add the seasoning after the fries are done cooking. It\u2019s great if you want crisp, plain fries with nothing but salt."
