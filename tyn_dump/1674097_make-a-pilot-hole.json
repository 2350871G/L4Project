        "Aim to drive in the nail no more than about 2/3 of the way.",
        "Pull out the nail carefully to avoid damaging the wood.",
        "Instead of using the claw on the back of the hammer head, first try to pull the nail out by gripping it with pliers and pulling straight out.",
        "If this fails, use the claw carefully so you don\u2019t damage the wood.",
        "If you\u2019re using the hammer head as a lever while utilizing the claw, place a rag between the hammer head and the wood to reduce the risk of damage.",
        "Drive the screw into the pilot hole.",
        "You can use a drill with a screwdriver bit, an electric screwdriver, or a manual screwdriver for the job.",
        "Work slowly so you don\u2019t split the wood.",
        "Pilot holes made with nails tend to be more difficult to drive screws into, and are more likely to cause splits or other damage to the wood.",
        "Rely on a drill to make a pilot hole when possible, especially on finished wood surfaces.",
        "Drilling Pilot Holes in Other Materials Choose an appropriate drill bit for materials like concrete, metal, or drywall.",
        "Most standard drill bit sets are well-suited to wood, but may be less effective (or just wear out more quickly) when used to drill into other materials.",
        "If you frequently work with range of different materials, consider investing in material-specific drill bit sets.",
        "Drywall (gypsum board) is a fairly soft material, and standard drill bits will do the job.",
        "However, you\u2019ll likely get smoother, better results and a longer bit lifespan with a drywall drill bit set.",
        "Concrete will wear out a standard drill bit quickly, and may even cause it to snap off.",
        "Choose dedicated concrete drill bits instead.",
        "It may be difficult to drill smoothly and accurately into metal with a standard drill bit, and the bit will likely wear out more rapidly.",
        "Look for a drill bit set meant for use with metal.",
        "Factor in any wall anchors you\u2019re using when determining the pilot hole size.",
        "A wall anchor is typically made of plastic, is tapped into a pilot hole, and expands to grip the hole when the screw is driven into the center of the anchor.",
        "They\u2019re rarely needed in wood, but often necessary with drywall, concrete, and metal.",
        "Make sure your pilot hole is large enough to properly accept the anchor you\u2019re using.",
        "If you\u2019re using a standard tap-in anchor with drywall, make the pilot hole equal to or just slightly smaller than the diameter of the anchor.",
        "Gently tap it into the pilot hole with a hammer.",
        "With concrete or metal, make the pilot hole a very slight amount larger in diameter than the anchor.",
        "Otherwise, the anchor will deform or break when you try to tap it into place.",
        "Use self-tapping drywall anchors to skip making pilot holes in drywall.",
        "Self-tapping drywall anchors add a threaded screw tip to a plastic anchor.",
        "Insert the screwdriver bit attachment into your drill, stick the tip into the head of the anchor, and drive it straight into the marked spot on the drywall\u2014no pilot hole needed.",
        "Once the anchor is in place, simply drill the screw into the hole in the head of the anchor.",
        "The interior of the anchor will expand to grip the drywall.",
        "Work with hammer drill to make drilling into concrete easier.",
        "Drilling into concrete is a tall task for a standard power drill, especially if you need to make multiple pilot holes.",
        "Consider renting or buying a hammer drill, which\u2014as the name indicates\u2014basically combines the motions of both a drill and a hammer.",
        "Hammer drills produce a bit of a \u201ckick,\u201d so use both hands, steady yourself, and follow all product instructions when using one."
