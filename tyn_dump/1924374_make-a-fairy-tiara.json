You can use any color of pipe cleaner you want, but metallic colors, such as gold, silver, or even metallic green, are especially popular among fairies. If you don't have a headband, you can twist and loop pipe cleaners to make a ring big enough to set on your child's head. If you don't have any headbands or pipe cleaners handy, you can strips of tin foil, and twist it into a circlet big enough to fit over your child's head."

If you don't have enough, try a matching color. Metallic green would look great with silver! If you don't have pipe cleaners, you can twist tin foil into 6-inch (15.24) long ropes for the short pieces. Twist a fourth one into a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) rope for the long piece."

    "text": " Making a Pipe Cleaner Tiara Wrap pipe cleaners around a thin, metal headband. Begin and finish wrapping the pipe cleaners 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from the ends of the headband. You can use any color of pipe cleaner you want, but metallic colors, such as gold, silver, or even metallic green, are especially popular among fairies. If you don't have a headband, you can twist and loop pipe cleaners to make a ring big enough to set on your child's head. If you don't have any headbands or pipe cleaners handy, you can strips of tin foil, and twist it into a circlet big enough to fit over your child's head. Cut three pipe cleaners in half. Set a fourth pipe cleaner aside; leave that one whole. Try to use the same color of pipe cleaner as you did for the headband. If you don't have enough, try a matching color. Metallic green would look great with silver! If you don't have pipe cleaners, you can twist tin foil into 6-inch (15.24) long ropes for the short pieces. Twist a fourth one into a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) rope for the long piece. Loop and twist the short pipe cleaners into V shapes. Wrap the middle of a short pipe cleaner around your finger, then twist it once or twice to form a loop. Slide the pipe cleaner off of your finger, then pry open the ends. You will have a shape that looks like an upside down V with a loop on the top. Repeat this step for all of the short pipe cleaners. Fold the fourth pipe cleaner into V with a heart at the tip. Fold the middle of the pipe cleaner into an m-like shape. Twist the legs together once or twice to complete the heart shape, then spread the tails open to make an upside down V. Twist the bottom ends of the heart-V piece onto the headband. Place the heart-V piece over the top-center of the headband. Twist the ends of the upside down V over the headband twice to lock it in place. Your headband will now have a triangle with a heart on it. Twist the remaining pieces onto the headband, three on each side of the heart-V. Twist the remaining pieces using the same technique as you did for the heart-V piece. You will need three on the left side of the heart, and three on the right. Make sure that the ends are all side-by-side and touching. Orient the headband horizontally and turn the spikes up. Set the headband flat on the table. Turn each of the spikes upwards, so that they are at 90-degree angles to the headband. You will now have something that looks like a tiara! If you want to make it even more tiara-like, you can hot glue plastic combs to the ends of the headband. Make sure that they are pointing downwards, away from the spikes. Decorate the tiara with rhinestones. Use hot glue to secure rhinestones over the headband and the spikes. You can place them wherever you want. Great places include the little o-shaped loops on top of the spikes, and the spots on the headband where the spikes connect. Don't want to use rhinestones? No problem! Try pearls, beads, fancy buttons, pompoms, sequins, or even tiny, fake flowers. Making a Lace Crown Roll poster paper into a tube, then cover it with plastic wrap. Roll a sheet of poster paper until it is big enough to fit your child's head. Use a few pieces of tape to hold it together. Next, wrap the poster paper tube with plastic wrap or wax paper. This will keep the paint from sticking. If you want to make a mini crown, you can use a cardstock instead. Wrap a piece of crocheted lace trim around the tube, then secure it with a pin. Choose some crocheted lace trim that you think would look nice as a crown. Something with peaks and points would work great. Wrap the lace around the tub with \u00bd-inch (1.27-centimeter) overlap, then secure it with a pin. Spray the lace with clear, acrylic spray sealer. Head off to a well-ventilated area. Coat the lace with clear, acrylic spray. Let the spray dry before moving on. Make sure that the spray has a glossy finish. If you don't want to use spray sealer, you can paint on a layer of clear decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) or fabric stiffener instead. Spray the lace with your desired color of spray paint. Metallic colors, such as gold or silver, will work the best, but you can use any color of spray paint you want.

Glue tiny rhinestones to the points. Decorate the body of the crown with larger rhinestones, brooches, cabochons, etc. Making a Floral Crown Cut some grapevine wire to three times the length you need. Measure around your child's head first, then cut a piece of grapevine wire to that's three times that length. If you can't find grapevine wire, you can use paper-wrapped wire or plain florist's wire instead. Use a pair of sturdy wire cutters for this so that you don't ruin your scissors. Coil the wire into a twisted ring. Roll the wire into a ring big enough to fit your child's head. Wrap the excess wire around it to create a thick, twisted band. Fold the ends of the wire down, then cover them with hot glue. This will keep them from scratching and snagging. If you used plain florist's wire, wrap the entire crown with green florist's tape. Cut three lengths of \u00bc-inch (0.64-centimeter) of satin ribbon. Choose 1 to 3 colors of ribbon. Measure and cut the ribbon to three 36-inch (91.44-centimeter) pieces. For a nicer finish, cut the ends of the ribbon at an angle. For a more magical effect, switch out one of the strands for sheer, iridescent, or metallic ribbon instead. Keep the ribbon from fraying by holding the ends over a flame until the fibers melt. Secure the ribbons to the crown with a slip knot. Stack all of the ribbons together so that the ends and edges match up. Fold the stack in half, then tuck the folded end down through the crown by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Pull the tails over the top of the wire and down through the loop. Gently tug on the tails to tighten the knot. Choose flowers or leaves that match your fairy costume. If your costume already has flowers on it, try to get the same kind. Small and medium-sized flowers will work the best. It would also be a good idea to think about the season as well.

        "Winter: try holly leaves, or use any white-colored flowers and leaves.",
        "Pull the flowers off of their stems.",
