If you aren't using and spelling the words you need to study, you may begin to forget exactly how to spell them. By regularly studying, using, and spelling the words on the test, you can make recalling the correct spelling much easier. Try to practice your spelling words at least once a day.

        "To use the trace, copy and recall method of study, you'll need 3 pieces of paper.",
        "One piece will be for the list of words you want to study and trace, another sheet will be for you to copy the words onto, and the final sheet will be used for you to write words down from memory.",
        "Go ahead and get these sheets of paper ready before you get started.",
        "You can write the function of each sheet at the top of the paper.",
        "On your tracing sheet, write down every word that you want to study.",

        "Some words seem to be spelled in strange ways, being pronounced differently from how they are written.",
        "Other words have long spellings and can be difficult to remember.",

        "Make sure you are spelling the word correctly when practicing.",
        "Getting in Extra Practice Make some flashcards.",
        "A simple way that you can boost your study sessions, is to make some flashcards that have your spelling words on them.",

        "Continue eliminating letters.",
        "Keep moving down to the next line and writing one less letter every time you spell the word.",

        "Add another letter to get \u201ct_wer\u201d.",

        "Double check that you've spelled the word correctly.",
        "Avoid looking at the original spelling of the word while you are rebuilding it.",
