Instead, use a nude liner that\u2019s as close to your natural lip color as possible. Keep in mind, though, that using a liner in a shade that matches your lipstick usually results in a more intense color on your lips.

                    "description": "For the longest wearing lip color, you should use a matte lipstick. The drier texture keeps the color from fading as easily as glossy shades do. To get the boldest color from your lipstick, though, apply it directly from the tube to your lips. If you\u2019re worried about not getting your bold lip color on precisely enough, you can apply it with a lip brush. You can also do a combination of applying from the tube and with a brush. For example, apply the color from the tube to the center of the lips and use a brush to apply it the edge where you want more precision. When it comes to choosing a bold lip color, there are a wide variety of options to consider. For example, a dark lipstick shade, such as a deep burgundy or wine, can look bold on fair skin. If you have darker skin, you may prefer going bold with a bright shade, such as a hot pink or cherry red. You can also go bold by choosing an unexpected lipstick color, such as black, blue, or green."
