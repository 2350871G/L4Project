        "Having your molds ready ahead of time means that you won\u2019t have to scramble to get everything ready.",
        "Whether or not you have to prepare your mold depends on what kind of mold you are using.",
        "Loaf or rectangular-shaped soap molds need to be lined with parchment paper or wax paper.",
        "Decorative molds for individual bars of soap typically don\u2019t need any preparation, although you could spray them with mold release made for soap-making.",
        "Silicone molds don\u2019t need any sort of preparation.",
        "Silicone is a special type of material that doesn\u2019t stick to whatever you\u2019re casting, in this case, soap.",
        "Measure the oils and pour them into a second stainless steel pot.",
        "Use your kitchen scale to weigh 4.8 ounces (140 g) of olive oil, 4.8 ounces (140 g) of coconut oil, 2.4 ounces (68 g) of apricot kernel oil, 1.6 ounces (45 g) of castor oil, 1.6 ounces (45 g) of cocoa butter, and 0.8 ounces (23 g) of jojoba oil.",
        "Pour all of the oils into a stainless steel pot as you finish weighing them.",
        "Don\u2019t add these oils to the pot with the lye water in it.",
        "Use a second pot.",
        "Make sure that you won't be using this second pot for cooking either.",
        "You can use other butters and oils, such as avocado oil, sunflower oil, and shea butter.",
        "If you decide to use different butters/oils, adjust your measurements using a soap making calculator, like http://soapcalc.net/calc/soapcalcwp.asp.",
        "Melt the oils over low to medium-low heat until they turn liquid.",
        "Stir the oils often with a spoon so that they blend together.",
        "Solid oils, such as coconut oil and cocoa butter, have a low melting point, so this process should not take more than a few minutes.",
        "You can use any spoon for this since the oils won\u2019t react with it.",
        "Make sure that you don't reuse this spoon for cooking, however!",
        "Let the oils cool until they're between 100 and 125 \u00b0F (38 and 52 \u00b0C).",
        "Once the oils have melted, take the pot off the stove and set it aside.",
        "Use a soap making thermometer to gauge the temperature as they cool down.",
        "Once the temperature is between 100 and 125 \u00b0F (38 and 52 \u00b0C), you\u2019re ready to add the lye water.",
        "You can use the same thermometer that you used for the lye water.",
        "You don't need to wipe it off since it should have air dried in the meantime.",
        "Pour the lye water into the oil mixture.",
        "Be very careful during this step not to spill or splash the lye water; it is still caustic during this stage and can cause severe burns if it gets on your skin.",
        "Keep your spray bottle filled with vinegar handy in case of accidents.",
        "The oils should be within 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) of your lye solution, so double-check and compare the temperatures before you start pouring.",
        "Blend the mixture with a stainless steel immersion blender until it traces.",
        "Mix the lye into the oils using a low speed setting until it turns smooth.",
        "Then, turn the speed up to medium, and blend it at 20-second pulses until it \u201ctraces.\u201d How long this will take will vary each time, but expect it to take about 10 to 15 minutes.The \u201ctrace\u201d stage  is when the soap mixture is able to hold ripples.",
        "Another way to test for \u201ctrace\u201d is if you can draw streaks through the surface of the mixture with the tip of a spoon.",
        "Many soap makers describe traced soap as \u201cthick custard.\u201d\nUse the immersion blender for soap making purposes only.",
        "Don't reuse it for cooking.",
        "Mix in 2 teaspoons of rose clay.",
        "This is one of the rare instances where you can measure something out by volume.",
        "This is because clay is considered an additive, much like lavender buds.",
        "Rose clay is great for soap because of its absorbent qualities.",
        "Other clays that you can use include:\nBentonite clay, which is light green.",
        "It's very absorbent, making it an excellent choice for oily skin.",
        "It's also slippery, which makes it good for shaving.",
        "Kaolin clay is a mild, white clay.",
        "Its fluffy texture will give you creamy, silky soap.",
        "Rhassoul clay, which is light brown in color.",
        "It's good for exfoliating and absorbing oils from skin.",
        "Stir in 0.5 ounces (14 g) of essential oil, if desired.",
        "You can use a combination of fragrances, or you can use just 1 fragrance.",
        "If you choose to use a combination of 2 or more fragrances, make sure that the total amount is 0.5 ounces (14 g).",
        "Rose geranium, jasmine, ylang ylang, and sandalwood combined pair wonderfully with the pink color of rose clay soap.",
        "If you prefer a simpler option, peppermint is a classic choice.",
        "You can also try lavender essential oil too.",
        "Pouring and Curing the Soap Pour the soap into your prepared soap molds.",
        "Use a silicone spatula to help guide the soap into the molds.",
        "Gently tap the mold against the counter to help settle any air bubbles.",
        "The soap is still caustic at this point, so you should continue to wear your safety gear.",
        "Move the soap into a warm, dry place, then cover it with a blanket.",
        "Covering soap with a blanket may sound silly, but it\u2019s actually very important to keep the soap warm as it cures.",
        "If you don\u2019t do this, the soap may develop cracks in its surface.",
        "Don\u2019t just stop at 1 blanket; use several!",
        "The heavier and thicker, the better.",
        "Consider covering your soap with a sheet of plastic wrap first.",
        "This will not only help trap the heat further, but also help keep your blanket clean.",
        "Wait 24 to 48 hours, then demold the soap.",
        "Remove the blanket first, then take the soap out of the mold.",
        "How you do this depends on what type of mold you are using.",
        "Some molds can be inverted, like a cake pan.",
        "Other molds must be taken apart first.",
        "If the soap feels soft after you take the blanket off, let it sit for a couple of hours.",
        "Keep the soap in the warm, dry place during these 24 to 48 hours.",
        "If you covered your soap with a sheet of plastic wrap in addition to the blanket, be sure to peel that off as well.",
        "Cut the soap into 1 in (2.5 cm) thick slices.",
        "If the soap is too soft and starts to deform when you handle it, wait a few days.",
        "Once it feels more firm, you can try cutting it again.",
        "A special slicer made for soap making would be ideal, but you can also use any sharp, non-serrated knife.",
        "Skip this step if you poured the soap into individual soap molds.",
        "It\u2019s already the right size.",
        "Allow the bars to cure on a drying rack for 4 to 6 weeks.",
        "Spread the soap bars out on the rack while they dry so that they don\u2019t touch.",
        "If they touch, they won\u2019t cure evenly.",
        "About once per week, rotate the soap bars so that they cure evenly on each side.",
        "This may sound like a long time, but it's very important; although the soap is solid, the lye is still caustic and can burn your skin.",
        "Keep the soap in a warm, dry place throughout this period.",
        "This is key to helping the soap cure properly.",
        "The soap will be cured and useable within 4 weeks, but it will be harsh and drying.",
        "The longer you let it cure, however, the milder it will become."
