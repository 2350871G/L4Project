When using seeds, you can generally expect that roughly \u00bc of the seeds won't grow, so you may want to plant several. Clippings should only be taken from established plants. You should wait until the roots of your plants are well developed and new growth begins appearing before taking clippings."

For best results in your garden, you should give your oregano about 10 in (25 cm) of space between plants. If you plan on growing your oregano indoors, choose a pot that is about 1 ft (30.5 cm) in diameter. This way your plant has adequate room to grow."

You should avoid attempting to use seeds that have been stored long periods of time. As time passes, the chance the seeds will grow decreases. Strip cuttings of their leaves on the end being planted.

Check whether your plant needs water or not by touching the soil around it. If it feels dry, you should thoroughly water the area.

Wait until the plant is about 4 in (10.2 cm) tall, and use a pair of shears or scissors to lightly thin the outer growth. Trimming also helps prevent excessive stem growth in your plant. This condition, called legginess, will reduce the yield of your crop. Where you trim your plant, you should notice it branch at that point when it continues growing. In turn, these branches will bear more leaves, meaning more oregano for you. As you trim, you can use the fresh oregano in a recipe, or dry it to use later on."
