Take out any drawers, too. If you notice that the hardware is scuffed or damaged, now is the perfect time to replace it. You can also spray paint the hardware to give it a fresh look. Labeling the cupboard doors before you remove them will help you put them back in the right place later on. Use a piece of tape or a pencil to write the cupboard's location, like \u201cupper right,\u201d on the back. Empty all of the contents of the cupboards, including food or dishes, before you begin cleaning or sanding."

Use a cloth to apply the TSP to the cupboards, then wipe them down with water and let them dry. The cupboards near the stove or hood will be the greasiest. If you want a more natural cleaning solution, try a TSP substitute, which you can find at any hardware store. Wear rubber gloves when handling harsh chemical cleaners to protect your skin.

How to Fill Dents or Scratches in Cupboards\nIf you notice any dings, scratches, or holes in your cupboards, press a wood or auto body filler into the spot.
