In a large pitcher, punch bowl, or similar container, mix the pomegranate juice and seltzer water in equal parts. Stir sugar into the mixture with a wooden spoon until your desired level of sweetness is achieved and the sugar completely dissolved. Serve your pomegranate seltzer over ice. Fill a glass with ice. Pour your pomegranate seltzer mixture over the ice. Take a lemon wedge and squeeze its juice into the mixture. Stir the mixture with a spoon or a straw to distribute the lemon juice and enjoy.

Juicing Pomegranate Seeds Cut open the pomegranate. At the top and bottom of the pomegranate, the rind thickens and can be cut away. Remove the rind until you see the red seeds inside the pomegranate. Then cut the pomegranate into wedges. Pomegranate juice is bright red. It tends to stain things, so be careful when handling it. You may want to wear an apron and gloves while doing this. Clean juice that\u2019s gotten onto counters and other kitchen surfaces immediately with soapy water to prevent stains from forming. Insert the pomegranate into a bowl filled with water. Take a large bowl and fill it with water. Your bowl should be large enough to accommodate all of the pomegranate wedges. Put the wedges into the water. Remove any large pieces of rind that float free. Separate the seeds from the rind. The rind of the pomegranate floats in water, but seeds sink to the bottom. Use your clean hands to knock seeds from the rind into the bottom of the bowl. Pick rind out of the water. Do this until all rind has been removed. Pulse the seeds in a blender. Drain the water from your bowl of seeds. Transfer your seeds to a blender. Close the blender and pulse it no more than a few times. Blending the seeds for too long will cause your juice to become cloudy. Strain the juice into an airtight container. Position a fine mesh strainer over an airtight container. Pour your seeds from your blender through the mesh strainer and into the airtight container. After the juice has drained, use a wooden spoon to press the pulp into the mesh to release juice trapped inside the pulp. Store your juice in a refrigerator. Refrigerated, your juice should stay good for several days. Add your juice to seltzer water for a refreshing drink. Drizzle some pomegranate juice on spring salads to add a refreshing tartness to them.",
