Be careful not to spill any of the water out of the top when you weigh it. If you do spill the water, take note of the new volume and re-weigh the water-filled graduated cylinder. For example, let\u2019s say the full graduated cylinder weighs 18.3 grams. Subtract the weight of the empty cylinder from the full cylinder. To get the mass of the water only, you must subtract out the weight of the graduated cylinder. The result is the mass of the water in the cylinder. In our example, the mass of the graduated cylinder is 11 g and the mass of the cylinder full of water is 18.3 g. 18.3 g \u2013 11 g = 7.3 g, therefore the mass of the water is 7.3 grams. Calculate the density by dividing the mass by the volume. Using the equation density = mass/volume, you can determine the density of water. Plug in the values of mass and volume you determined and solve. Mass of the water: 7.3 g\nVolume of the water: 7.3 mL\nDensity of water = 7.3/7.3 = 1 g/mL Understanding Density Define the equation for density.
