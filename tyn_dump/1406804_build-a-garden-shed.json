    "text": " Cutting the Wood Trim the foundation boards to size. Cut 3 2 by 8 in (5.1 by 20.3 cm) boards to 16 feet (4.9 m). These boards will form part of the mudslips or bottom of the shed. Also, trim 2 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) boards to 16 feet (4.9 m), which will form the other part of the mudslips. Finally, cut 15 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) boards to fit across the center of the floor, going from one mudslip to the other. They should be 10 feet (3.0 m) each. Set these in one area so you know they're for the foundation. Cut 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) pieces to length for the walls. Cut 26 boards to the height you want at the back of the shed, typically 6 feet (1.8 m); this equals 6 boards for the back wall and 10 for each of the sides. For the front, cut 4 boards that are 12 feet (3.7 m) high. Also, cut the boards for the tops and bottoms of the wall frames. Start with 4 boards that are 113 inches (290 cm) long for the front and back walls. For the sides, cut 4 boards that are 192 inches (490 cm) long. Always measure carefully before cutting the boards. Make the pieces for the triangular roof braces. Draw out the schematic for the triangle on a piece of plywood. The triangle will need to be 188.5 inches (479 cm) on the bottom. Measure a right angle, and then create a side going up that's 72 inches (180 cm) tall. Draw a line from the top of this edge down to the other end of the board on the bottom, forming a triangle. Cut pieces to fit in the triangle. You'll need to cut the hypotenuse (the side that doesn't touch the right angle of the triangle) at an angle on both ends to meet the other boards. Cut and measure 4 boards to go vertically in the triangle. Each board will be a different height, and you'll need to cut the top of the board at an angle. Cut enough boards for 2 triangles, one for each side. Trim the boards for the roof. Cut 2 2 by 8 in (5.1 by 20.3 cm) boards to 10 feet (3.0 m), one each to go on the top of the walls at the front and back. Cut 11 2 by 8 in (5.1 by 20.3 cm) rafters for the roof. The rafters will run from the top of the front wall to the top of the back wall. Measure how long you want yours to be when you get the roof up. They will need to be at least 19 feet (5.8 m) to make an overhang of 1 foot (0.30 m) on each end. Building the Foundation Lay down a foundation of gravel. Use a wheelbarrow and a shovel to spread it out. You'll need a square of gravel that's about 12 by 18 feet (3.7 by 5.5 m) and enough gravel to spread it to a depth of 4 inches (10 cm). You don't have to add gravel, but it will help keep the shed dry. Set 12 solid concrete blocks in 4 inches (10 cm) of gravel. Choose blocks that are 4 by 8 by 16 inches (10 by 20 by 41 cm). Set them 59 inches (150 cm) apart from each other in the gravel you've laid out. When setting up the blocks, place them in a 3-by-4 square. Make 3 rows of 4 blocks, evenly spaced apart. After setting out the blocks, make sure the blocks are all level in the ground and check to ensure they are level to each other. If they're not, add 2 in (5.1 cm) patio blocks, cedar shingles, or asphalt roofing to the tops of any blocks that are short. Place 3 16 ft (4.9 m) 2 by 8 in (5.1 by 20.3 cm) boards on the blocks. Lay these boards across the top of the concrete rows going lengthwise. Center them on the blocks; they should be the same width as the blocks. Join 2 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) boards to the floorboards on the sides to make mudslips. Eventually, you want the wider boards on the bottom against the concrete blocks and the smaller boards on their sides running along the outer edge of that board on top. However, you'll need to flip them over to nail the smaller board in place. Use a nail gun to drive a nail in every 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) to join the boards. You should now have \"L\"-shaped joists that you can flip over onto the concrete blocks on either end. Nail in 10 ft (3.0 m) 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) boards along the center of the floor. You'll need about 15 of these boards, as you need one on each end and the others spaced out across the floor. Set the boards on their edges and lay them across the 3 boards you set out earlier, fitting them into the mudslips on both ends of the boards. Space them out about 16 inches (41 cm) apart from each other and nail them into place. Place nails at an angle to drive them through these boards and into the mudslips and middle support below. Measure the floor from corner to corner. Measure the other way from corner to corner, too. These 2 measurements need to be equal before you move on. If they're not, you may need to take some boards out and adjust the angles of the boards. Trim plywood to fit over the flooring and nail it in. If your shed came in a kit, the boards should already be cut to fit. Otherwise, you'll need to measure the boards against the floor you've created. Lay them out to see how the pieces fit and trim off any areas that are too big for the floor you've created. Once your pieces all fit, nail the particle board into the joists below using a nail gun. It helps to draw chalk lines across the board where the joists are so you know where to nail. Creating the Walls Mark the platform to use as a guide for the back wall. Set a chalk line 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) from each side edge. Measure between these lines to make sure it's 113 inches (290 cm) apart; take measurements at different points to see if the lines are parallel all along the platform. Lay the boards out for the back wall and nail them to each other. Place the 2 113 in (290 cm) boards at the top and bottom of the wall. Add 2 6 ft (1.8 m) boards to each end. Space the other 4 6 ft (1.8 m) boards out evenly across the middle of the wall running up and down. Nail the boards into each other with size 16 penny nails. Nail into the top and bottom of the wall at each perpendicular board, adding 2-3 nails to each end for every board. Add plywood siding to the wall. Cut the plywood to fit the wall by measuring the wall and the plywood. Lay it on top of the wall, and then use size 6 penny nails to nail it into the boards below. Try to place a nail at least every 1 foot (0.30 m) or so. Move this wall off the platform to work on another wall. Repeat the process for the side walls. Lay 2 192 in (490 cm) boards going lengthwise along the platform, one at the top and one at the bottom to form the wall. Place 1 6 ft (1.8 m) board on each end and space the other 8 out along the middle at an equal distance. Nail the wall together with size 16 penny nails by adding 2-3 at the top and bottom of each vertical board. Wait to cut and nail in the plywood siding for this wall. Do this step twice to build a wall for each side. Measure the door you plan to use for the front. Before building the front wall, you need to know how big of a space you need to leave in the front wall for a door. Measure the height and width of the door using a tape measure. Make a frame for the door. Create the frame out of your 2 by 4 in (5.1 by 10.2 cm) boards. Cut 2 boards that go the height of the door and 1 that is the width of the door plus the width of the other 2 boards. Place the 2 longer boards parallel to each on the floor on their edges and the shorter board perpendicular at the top on its edge. Spread the 2 longer boards out so they are at either end of the shorter board, then nail them into place with size 16 penny nails to form the frame. Build the front wall. Lay out 2 113 in (290 cm) boards at the top and bottom. Lay down the door frame you built where you want the door to go. Space out 3-4 12 ft (3.7 m) on either side of the door frame, placing one each directly on either side of the door. Cut a board to fit on top of the door frame going horizontally between the 2 vertical boards. Then, cut a board to go from the top of that board up to the top board of the wall frame. Nail everything together in the frame with size 16 penny nails. Secure the long board to the top and bottom boards and the door frame to the vertical boards. You may need to go in at an angle for the vertical board above the door. Cut plywood siding to fit over everything but the door frame and nail it into place with size 6 penny nails. Make triangular pieces for the side walls to brace the roof. Lay out the boards you made for the triangular roof brace. Nail the boards into place with size 16 penny nails. Remember, you need to make 2 triangles, one for each side. Nail these triangles into the top of the side walls. Place the longest edge along the top of the wall with the right angle at the front. This side will meet the tall wall at the front of the shed. Use size 16 penny nails to attach the piece to the top of the wall. Cut plywood siding to fit the walls and nail it into place. Lifting and Nailing the Walls Together Nail 2-3 small wood braces along the floor on each side. Use scrap boards that are about 1 foot (0.30 m) long. Nail them into place so that they go up over the edge of the floor. That way, when you're lifting the walls up, they won't slip off the platform. Ask for help to raise the back wall and nail it in place. While there are ways to do this on your own, the easiest and safest way is to grab another person to help. Brace the bottom against the pieces you nailed into the floor and swing the top edge up, walking it into place with your hands. Screw the wall into place at the bottom. With a drill, screw through the bottom board in the frame of the wall into the floor below. Use at least 2 3 in (7.6 cm) screws between each vertical stud (board) to hold it in place. Make sure you leave even spaces on both edges of the back wall to slide the sides in. Raise the other walls and screw them in place. Go through the same process with the other walls, starting with the sides. After screwing in the bottoms, screw the sides into the back panel, too, placing a screw every 1 foot (0.30 m) or so. Face the right angle of the triangle on top to the front. That way, it will meet the front wall. Once you're done with the sides, do the same with the front, screwing it into place. Building the Roof Nail a 2 by 8 in (5.1 by 20.3 cm) board on the front and back walls at the top. These boards will provide a brace for the rafters. When you nail them up, leave half of the board above the wall, which you'll notch the rafters into in a moment. Cut notches out of the rafters for the boards you just nailed in pace. Measure and mark a board and see if it fits properly, then cut the rest of the boards. The notches in the rafter should just slide into place on top of the end boards. Keep in mind that you'll need overhang on each end. Trim the ends before notching the boards into place; cut the ends at an angle so they are perpendicular to the ground. Space the rafters about 1 foot (0.30 m) apart across the roof. Put 1 on each end of the roof. Place the other boards evenly spaced out between the 2 end pieces. Place a hurricane tie on the inside where each rafter slides into the end boards. Screw them into place. A hurricane tie is a type of brace. Slide it over the bottom of the board. You should see holes to screw it into place. Cut and add braces to the middle of the roof. Moving from side to side, add cut boards across the center of the roof. You will need to cut 1 to go in between every 2 rafters. Nail them into the rafters once they're cut, making a straight line. Finish the edges with a board. Place a board over the trimmed ends of the rafters, putting 1 in the front and 1 in the back. Push it up so it's even with the top of the rafter boards, then nail them into the ends of the rafters. Cut and nail plywood or orient strand boards (OSB) to the roof. These will form the hard part of the roof. Measure how long and wide the boards should be. They need to cover the rafters with no overhang. Once you have them cut, lay them on the roof and nail them into place. Roll out tar paper over the roof and nail it down. The tar paper should completely cover the OSBs. Start at the bottom of the slant, going across the whole roof. On the next layer, overlap the first layer. Use roofing staples to tack the tar paper into place. Move all the way up the roof until you cover the boards at the end of the rafters. Trim off any excess paper. Nail in an aluminum drip edge over the tar paper. Place the edge over the top of the tar paper, bending it down over the board at the front. Nail the aluminum drip edge in place with aluminum nails. Attach shingles starting at the bottom. Place shingles next to each across the roof, nailing them into place. On the next section, overlap these shingles by 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm). Make sure you don't put the seams in the same places by alternating the rows. Keep moving up the roof until you reach the top with the shingles. Read the instructions for your shingles. Typically, you use 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) roofing nails to install them. Finishing the Shed Install the door. How you install the door depends on what type you choose. Typically, you need to attach the hinges on the wall and the door. You may also need to drill a hole for the latch and screw the latch plate into place if your handle has one. You may also need to install a lip at the bottom of the door to help it hang properly. Add stain for a natural look if you bought unstained plywood siding. One way to finish the shed is to simply stain the wood. When staining wood, paint it on in the same direction as the grain of the wood. Use paintbrushes or rollers to make an even layer. You'll likely need to add 2 layers. If you stain it, you'll also need to paint on an all-weather finish for wood after the stain dries. Paint the wood for a colorful finish. Another option is to use outdoor latex paint. Paint it on with rollers or paintbrushes, adding it on in a smooth layer. Once it dries, add a second layer of paint. You likely won't need a sealant for the paint. Pick a dry, windless day for the best results when painting.",
