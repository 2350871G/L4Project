    "text": " Ping-Pong Ball Make a paperclip stand for your snitch. First, take a ping pong ball, and make a small hole. This can be done with anything sharp and small. Unfold the large paper clip and form it to make an appropriate stand. Stick the paper clip into the hole in the ball. Paint your snitch. Put down some newspaper beneath the ping-pong ball so that the paint doesn't stain your workstation. Use a metallic gold spray paint cover your ball with at least two coats. Let it dry.

You can do the wings as you like, but an idea is to cut out 2 appropriately-sizes half circles, and then cut \"flaps\" out of the straight sides, to make feathers. Attach everything together. Glue the cut-out half-ping pong balls to the actual ball on the stand. Put some glue on the end of each wing, and tuck it in the swirls. Hold it together for a few seconds so that they stays on. Let the glue dry before you remove your finished snitch from its stand. Styrofoam Ball Paint the snitch. Use metallic golden spray paint on the styrofoam ball. Put newspaper down so you don't stain your workstation\nStick a toothpick to hold the ball while you paint it. Make the coats light so that the paint doesn't melt the styrofoam. Let it dry. Attach glitter or sequins (optional). As an alternative to using paint, you can use glitter or sequins. If you want to use glitter to decorate your snitch, just spray the ball with adhesive, and sprinkle glitter over it. Brush off excess glitter and reapply until you are happy with the result. If you want to use gold sequins, stick small pins into the sequins, and then stick them into the styrofoam ball, until the ball is evenly covered with sequins. Attach feathers. Take two gold, yellow, or white feathers, coat the ends with glue, and stick onto the ball. Make sure the wings are perfectly opposite one another on the ball. If the stems of the feathers are strong enough, they can be stuck directly into the styrofoam, without the need for glue. Christmas Ornament Prepare the wings.
