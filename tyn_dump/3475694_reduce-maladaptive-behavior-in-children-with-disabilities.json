        "coming up with a hand signal that means \"get me out of here\" when the child notices stress building up, so she can calm down somewhere quiet instead of pushing herself to the point of explosion) When you see the child engaging in the maladaptive behavior, ask them to use the replacement behavior instead.",
        "For example, if your son screams when upset, calmly ask him to take deep breaths and tell you what's wrong, just like you brainstormed together.",
        "Be gentle with the child.",
        "Maladaptive behavior often emerges during stress, so (s)he may not be thinking clearly, and may need extra reminders.",
        "Remind the child why the replacement behavior is good.",
        "For example, \"It's hard for me to help you when you scream.",
        "If you talk to me and tell me what's wrong, then I'll understand why you're upset, and I can help you fix the problem.\"",
        "Encourage the child when they begin to use the replacement behavior.",
        "Praise their efforts and tell them how proud you are of their skills.",
        "For example, \"I noticed that you were getting mad, and that you started to take deep breaths and walked away.",
        "I'm really proud of how strong and mature you were.",
        "Good job!\"",
        "Emphasize why they did a good thing.",
        "This helps them learn the distinction between people-pleasing and constructively taking advice.",
        "Never pressure the child or teach them to comply for compliance's sake, as this will hamper their social skills as an adult.",
        "Younger children may benefit from a reward system.",
        "For example, each time a girl successfully uses breathing techniques to calm herself, she gets a gold sticker to place on her chart.",
        "When she fills the chart, you bring home a treat from the grocery store or let her pick out a small toy.",
        "Avoid overusing reward systems, because the child may become too dependent on approval.",
        "Reward systems should be phased out as a child gets older.",
        "The child/teen should learn how to set boundaries and say no, so they can be safe.",
        "Keep clear communication between yourself and the child.",
        "Treat the child's communication (verbal and nonverbal) with respect, and always presume competence.",
        "Talk regularly to the child so they know what's going on and what's in your mind.",
        "That way, the child will trust you and talk to you if a problem arises.",
        "Outside Intervention Call a meeting of caregivers.",
        "Bring every person (parents, therapists, teachers, older siblings) who will be involved in replacing the maladaptive behavior.",
        "It is best if everyone meets at the same time and place so that no misunderstandings can exist.",
        "One team member should take notes or record the meeting.",
