        "For smaller bridges, coins will work as weighted objects.",
        "For larger bridges, consider using something like bags of sand or, if your bridge is quite large, actual weights from a weight set.",
        "Make sure you know the actual weight of the objects you use so that you can accurately determine how much weight you\u2019ve added to the bridge before it collapses.",
        "Add weight.",
        "Begin to add weights to the container a little at a time.",
        "Take care not to jar the bridge or cause the container to swing.",
        "This can be a very nerve-wracking process.",
        "Watch the bridge collapse.",
        "Eventually, you will have added too much weight for your bridge to hold and it will collapse.",
        "After enjoying the bridge\u2019s destruction, determine how much weight the bridge held by calculating the sum of the weights you added to the bridge.",
        "Go back to the drawing board.",
        "You will now want to go through this process again making minor alterations to the materials or adjustments to how you constructed the bridge.",
        "The goal here is to see if you can build a stronger bridge capable of holding more weight.",
        "Like any good science experiment, a little trial and error will be necessary.",
        "Strengthening Your Bridge Select the best building materials.",
        "If you want to make a bridge that can sustain large amounts of weight, you will need to use the best materials.",
        "As stated above, epoxy is the strongest bonding agent you can use.",
        "Also, you want to make sure you have plenty of pasta on-hand to make the necessary reinforcements to your bridge.",
        "Consider the benefits and disadvantages of various types of pasta.Rounded spaghetti noodles may be better for some parts of your bridge while flattened noodles, like linguine, may be better for other parts.",
        "Design a stronger bridge.",
        "The purpose of building a spaghetti bridge is to apply the theoretical principles of engineering to a real-life construction project.",
        "As such, how you design the bridge deeply impacts the overall strength of the bridge.",
        "Some tips for building a stronger bridge include:\nUse triangular rather than rectangular trusses.",
        "Build the roadbed with multiple layers of pasta.",
        "You should leave the middle layer of your pasta roadbed unglued.",
        "Some flexibility in the pasta helps to redistribute weight across your bridge.",
        "Limit the space your bridge must cover.",
        "The longer the gap a bridge has to span, the harder it will be to redistribute the weight from one area across the entire bridge.",
        "So, if it is up to you, making a shorter bridge will help your bridge sustain more weight.",
        "Strike a balance.",
        "There is a relationship between the weight and strength of your bridge.",
        "Adding more pasta to your bridge during construction, when properly built, should add strength, but also adds more weight.",
        "The heavier your bridge is, the more likely it is that it will collapse when extra weight is applied.",
        "So, make sure you account for the weight of your bridge when designing your bridge.",
        "Entering Your Bridge for Competition Identify where to compete.",
        "A number of schools, school districts, science museums, universities, and engineering-oriented groups hold spaghetti bridge building competitions.",
        "Find one in your area and sign up.",
        "Some competitions have various categories for different types of bridges.",
        "Make sure you identify what type of bridge you want to build for the competition and enter it into the correct category.",
        "Read the rules closely.",
        "Spaghetti bridge building contests have unique rules about sanctioned building materials, size limitations or restrictions, types and sizes of weights, etc\u2026 Be sure to read and follow all of the rules carefully.",
        "You don\u2019t want to get disqualified.",
        "Look for inspiration.",
        "You can find inspiration for your spaghetti bridge by looking at actual bridges around the world.",
        "Bridges are unique feats of engineering, with each one being built to very exact specifications.",
        "As such, looking at real life bridges can give you some great ideas to outdo the competition when the time comes.",
        "Practice.",
        "Each spaghetti bridge building competition is different and, as such, will employ a different system of applying weight to the bridge to make it collapse.",
        "It is wise to start preparing early and to use the same type and placement of weights to test the strength of the bridge you will build.",
        "Be careful when moving your bridge.",
        "While some bridge competitions require that you build your bridge on-site, others may require you to bring an already built bridge to the competition.",
        "If this is the case, make sure you have a safe and effective way to move your bridge from point A to point B without breaking or weakening your bridge."
