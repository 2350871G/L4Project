Draw several figures. Pick a hand and draw a circle, a square, and a triangle. Draw the same shapes with your other hand. Compare your drawings, and make a note of which hand produced clearer lines and more accurate shapes. Completing Manual Activities Pick something up. Find several objects and place them directly in front of you. Pick it up, without consciously choosing a hand. This step will likely require several repeats over a period of time to erase accidental bias. Take note of which hand was used more frequently. Use eating utensils.

Concluding Which Hand is Dominant Make a list of which hand you preferred in each test. Tally the number of times you used each hand in writing and drawing. Do the same for other manual activities, and take a total. The hand you predominantly used in writing and drawing will often be how you identify which handedness you have, as it is the most socially relevant, apparent, and distinctive activity impacted by handedness. Your other activities will give you an impression of your overall left or right-handedness. Which hand you identify as your dominant intuitively is likely to be your overall dominant hand, even if you write with the opposite hand. Look to see if the number of times you used each hand is equivalent or very close in number. If so, you are likely mixed-handed. You are truly ambidextrous if there was little to no difficulty or change in outcome from changing hands in the other activities.
