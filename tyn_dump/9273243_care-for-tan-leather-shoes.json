Doing this regularly will prevent dirt and grime from building up on your shoes. Polish your leather shoes once a month. A regular polishing routine will keep your shoes looking new.

Rub the conditioner into the leather, making sure the entire outer surface of each shoe has been treated. Condition your shoes after every monthly polish so you don't forget. Waterproof your leather shoes to protect them from water damage. Look for a spray-on or wax-based waterproof compound designed specifically for leather. Test an inconspicuous spot on your shoes first to see if the compound causes discoloration. If it doesn\u2019t, apply an even coat of the compound to the entire outer surface of your shoes. Cleaning Tan Leather Shoes Use a gentle leather cleaner that contains surfactants. Surfactants draw out dirt and other particles from leather. Some common surfactants to look for on the ingredients list are alkyl sulfates, alkylbenzene sulfonate, imidazolines, and betaines. Make sure the leather cleaner you use doesn\u2019t have alcohol or abrasives in it; these ingredients can damage leather. Always check the ingredients label on a cleaner before you use it.

If the stain doesn\u2019t lift, gently rub the mixture into the stain with the cloth. Wipe off the vinegar mixture with a different damp cloth and let the shoes dry. Storing Your Shoes Use shoehorns to preserve the shape of your shoes. Get two shoehorns that match your foot size and put them in your leather shoes whenever you\u2019ll be storing them for over a week. Always let your shoes rest for one day after wearing them before putting the shoehorns in; otherwise you may trap damaging moisture in the shoes. Stuff and wrap your shoes with acid-free paper.
