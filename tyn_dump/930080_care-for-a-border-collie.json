You should purchase a leash, collar, dog food, food and water dishes, toys, a crate, and a dog hairbrush. The leash should be an appropriate length for your Border Collie, and comfortable for you and your dog. This means that it should be long enough to allow your energetic Collie some freedom of movement, but short enough to still maintain control over your dog. Avoid retractable leashes as these may encourage your dog to pull. Instead, opt for a long line leash while training your Collie and getting to know their personality better. The collar must have an ID tag with your phone number and/or address on it. The food and water dishes should be stainless steel if possible. Purchase \"indestructible\" dog toys such as Kong brand toys. Since Collies tend to vigorously chew their toys, this kind will last longer (though most will be destroyed eventually) than stuffed toys or dainty rubber squeaky toys. If you want to crate train your Border Collie, be sure to get a crate that is big enough for your pup. The recommended crate size is typically 36 in (91 cm) x 30 in (76 cm)."
