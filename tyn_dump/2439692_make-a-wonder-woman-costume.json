Look for one in a glossy material, if possible. For a more modest variation, use a red swimsuit or snug red tank top. You can also cut up a dress from the top and have the open side stitched."

There are several designs you could use for the emblem, which you can find photos of online, and they range from elaborate eagle patterns to simple W shapes. One option is to cut a W-shaped eagle out of craft foam, spray paint it gold, and then glue it to the top. For something very simple, just line the top front edge of your bustier, swimsuit, or tank top with gold tape. For something a little more daring, create a double-layer W (one W inside another W) with wings or straight horizontal lines coming off the top ends of both W shapes."

High-waisted boy shorts work perfectly, but blue gym shorts can work as well. If you want a more modest option, though, you can wear a blue miniskirt, like Wonder Woman used to wear in the old comics. In some modern revamps of the comic, Wonder Woman is wearing tight blue or black pants, so you could go this route if you\u2019re not comfortable wearing shorts or a skirt. In the 2017 film, she wears a skirt with strips of fabric hanging down, which also provides more coverage. Create this look by finding strips of scrap leather and painting them blue before sewing or gluing them to the bottom of your bustier."
