Cut off the top portion of the bottle so that you have a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide opening. You could also measure down 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the base of the neck, make a mark, then use that mark as your cutting guide. Use a box cutter or craft blade to cut the bottle. Cut the bottom off of the plastic bottle. Some plastic soda bottles have a molded line. If your bottle is one of those, you can use that line as a cutting guide. Otherwise, cut off 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) off of the bottom of your bottle. Use a pair of scissors to trim away ragged edges on the top and bottom. If you'd like, you can make the bottom smoother by pressing a hot iron against it for 15 to 20 seconds. Don't do this for the top hole, or the plastic bags may get caught. Use the highest setting on your iron. Paint or decorate the bottle, if desired. Your holder is almost complete, but you can make it look nicer (and less like a plastic bottle) by spray painting it or by covering it with scrapbooking paper. Attach the scrapbooking paper with double-sided tape. Punch two holes on both sides of the cut bottom edge, and thread a ribbon through them. This is now the top of your plastic bag holder. Alternatively, you can also punch just one hole, thread a short piece of ribbon through it, then tie the ribbon into a loop. Hang the holder by the ribbon, then fill it with plastic bags. Pull the plastic bags out from the smaller hole at the bottom. Use the plastic bag holder. Pull the plastic bags out, one at a time, from the bottom hole.
