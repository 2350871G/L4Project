                    "description": "Any solvent that\u2019s strong enough to eat away at set-in ink stains will also be strong enough to cause skin irritation with prolonged exposure. For this reason, it\u2019s a good idea to always pull on a pair of gloves anytime you\u2019re going to be working with chemical solvents manually. If you don\u2019t happen to have any gloves handy, do your best to minimize your exposure to the solvent, and be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water afterwards. Avoid cloth or textile gloves. Absorbent fabrics can easily soak up the solvent you use and end up saturating your skin."

Best of all, you probably have at least one of these items sitting around in your home\u2019s supply closet already. For a gentler solution, try substituting hand sanitizer or distilled white vinegar.
