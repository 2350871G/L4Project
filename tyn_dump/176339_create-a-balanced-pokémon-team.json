Also try to make strategies that can counter your friend's. For example, if his main Pok\u00e9mon is a Snorlax who tanks (can take many hits while dealing damage to your team and healing itself with Rest): consider \"Sub-Punching\" it. Put up a Substitute, and then use Focus Punch the next turn. All teams should have a high type variety, usually with no more than two Pok\u00e9mon sharing a weakness. This not only means mixing types, but also physical and special users as well. However, if you plan on Baton Passing Nasty Plot or Swords Dance, having more of one type of attack than the other will broaden your options a bit. It's also a good idea to keep some Pok\u00e9mon on your team that are not designed for attacking, but instead for healing other Pok\u00e9mon or taking many hits. This is called \"stalling.\" If you aren't battling competitively, you don't have to be so selective, but it is a good thing to keep in mind, and your Pok\u00e9mon team will be far stronger because of it!"

Pok\u00e9mon can learn moves from their parents. If both parents have a move that the baby can learn from level up, it will start with that move. There are also certain moves, called egg moves, that a Pok\u00e9mon can only learn by breeding a father or mother (from Gen VI onward) with that move. TM or HM moves can only be passed down in games prior to Gen VI. These moves are only passed down from the father. Natures can be inherited if the parent holds an Everstone.

At level 100, a stat will be roughly increased by the IV value, with the increase being lower at lower levels. These can make a huge difference in the power of your Pok\u00e9mon, as well as determining what type of Hidden Power it has. Therefore, you probably want high IVs, but there are cases where you want low IVs for a certain stat like in Trick Room teams or a certain number of IVs in the stats that affect Hidden Power. Hidden Power is a Special move that can be learned by nearly every Pok\u00e9mon which changes type and power based on its IVs. It can be useful for special attackers who need coverage of a certain type. There are online calculators which can determine what IVs you need for Hidden Power. Three of a Pok\u00e9mon's IVs are randomly inherited from its parents. If either parent holds a Power item (Power Bracer, Anklet, Band, Lens, Weight, Belt), the baby will inherit the corresponding stat. If both parents hold one, the baby will only inherit one of those stats from a randomly chosen parent. After that, the baby will inherit two other random IVs. From B/W onward, if one Pok\u00e9mon holds a Destiny Knot, 5 IVs will be inherited."

Except in some circumstances, do not have two moves of the same type on one Pok\u00e9mon, such as Surf and Hydro Pump. This is because you will want to ensure that your Pok\u00e9mon can defeat as many types of Pok\u00e9mon as possible. Stat boosters and restoration moves are OK (Synthesis, Aromatherapy, Growth and Petal Dance are all Grass-type moves, but only one is used for attacking), as are moves like Flamethrower and Overheat, which can be used in different circumstances. An attacking Pok\u00e9mon should have a strong move/moves of its own type, as it will get a boost to this move's power (called Same Type Attack Bonus or STAB). It should also have coverage moves that can hit different types than your main attack, otherwise your Pok\u00e9mon will be walled by certain types. Some attackers can use a set-up move which can bring its power up to ridiculous amounts, others might use some support move, healing, or switching moves like U-Turn. Priority is also a good idea, because moves of a higher priority will always go before moves of a lower priority. Your team's tank should be a hardy Pok\u00e9mon with high HP that can take a lot of damage while you heal and manage your other Pok\u00e9mon. Tanks should have moves like healing, Taunt, Protect or Substitute, or status. Moves like Aromatherapy or Wish that help your teammates are good too. Support Pok\u00e9mon use status moves to cripple opposing Pok\u00e9mon, get rid of threats like set-up sweepers, get rid of entry hazards, or help your team."

Be sure that you can lay traps (e.g. Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes). Have stat boosting moves such as Swords Dance. It may not look like much, as you may just want to attack as soon as possible, but Swords Dance doubles your Pok\u00e9mon's Attack power. Even if it just adds 50%, try it anyway. Use moves with added effects, such as Flamethrower and Blizzard, which respectively have a chance of burning and freezing the target. Make sure that the moves you use are complemented by the Pok\u00e9mon's stats. For example, using Flamethrower and Blizzard with a Pok\u00e9mon that has a low special attack stat wouldn't be a good idea. Keep in mind that many Pok\u00e9mon aren't offensively inclined. These Pok\u00e9mon would likely be most effective with status moves that cause these effects, as they wouldn't do much damage with physical or special attacks."

If you're trying to beat a friend, then try to use Pok\u00e9mon whose types are super-effective against his/hers. Also try to make strategies that can counter your friend's. For example, if his main Pok\u00e9mon is a Snorlax who tanks (can take many hits while dealing damage to your team and healing itself with Rest): consider \"Sub-Punching\" it. Put up a Substitute, and then use Focus Punch the next turn. All teams should have a high type variety, usually with no more than two Pok\u00e9mon sharing a weakness. This not only means mixing types, but also physical and special users as well. However, if you plan on Baton Passing Nasty Plot or Swords Dance, having more of one type of attack than the other will broaden your options a bit. It's also a good idea to keep some Pok\u00e9mon on your team that are not designed for attacking, but instead for healing other Pok\u00e9mon or taking many hits. This is called \"stalling.\" If you aren't battling competitively, you don't have to be so selective, but it is a good thing to keep in mind, and your Pok\u00e9mon team will be far stronger because of it! Try basing a team around a specific move or battle mechanic. Some teams may be based around a single mechanic, like weather, Trick Room, or Tailwind. If you're going to go this route, your team should have many Pok\u00e9mon that can take advantage of that effect. Be sure to include Pok\u00e9mon that can balance out any weaknesses and one or two who can set up the field condition. Be sure that your team includes a strong core. This is essential for a competitive team. A core is two or three Pok\u00e9mon whose strengths and weaknesses complement each other and who can switch in to each other's counters. Have the right nature on your Pok\u00e9mon. Natures will decrease one stat by 10%, while increasing another by 10%. It's important to have one that will increase a stat that is important to that Pok\u00e9mon, while decreasing a less important stat, like Special Attack for physical attackers. Breeding Pok\u00e9mon Consider breeding Pok\u00e9mon. In order to get Pok\u00e9mon that are optimal for battling, you may need to breed for desirable egg moves, IVs, or natures. Pok\u00e9mon can learn moves from their parents. If both parents have a move that the baby can learn from level up, it will start with that move. There are also certain moves, called egg moves, that a Pok\u00e9mon can only learn by breeding a father or mother (from Gen VI onward) with that move. TM or HM moves can only be passed down in games prior to Gen VI. These moves are only passed down from the father. Natures can be inherited if the parent holds an Everstone. The chance is 50% prior to B/W 2, and guaranteed from then onward. Know that IVs (Individual Values) can be passed down. An IV is a randomized hidden value for each stat, from 0-31. At level 100, a stat will be roughly increased by the IV value, with the increase being lower at lower levels. These can make a huge difference in the power of your Pok\u00e9mon, as well as determining what type of Hidden Power it has. Therefore, you probably want high IVs, but there are cases where you want low IVs for a certain stat like in Trick Room teams or a certain number of IVs in the stats that affect Hidden Power. Hidden Power is a Special move that can be learned by nearly every Pok\u00e9mon which changes type and power based on its IVs. It can be useful for special attackers who need coverage of a certain type. There are online calculators which can determine what IVs you need for Hidden Power. Three of a Pok\u00e9mon's IVs are randomly inherited from its parents. If either parent holds a Power item (Power Bracer, Anklet, Band, Lens, Weight, Belt), the baby will inherit the corresponding stat. If both parents hold one, the baby will only inherit one of those stats from a randomly chosen parent. After that, the baby will inherit two other random IVs. From B/W onward, if one Pok\u00e9mon holds a Destiny Knot, 5 IVs will be inherited. Breed for Hidden Abilities. Hidden Abilities can be passed down if the female Pok\u00e9mon has it. Male and genderless Pok\u00e9mon can pass on their hidden abilities when bred with Ditto. The female Pok\u00e9mon has an 80% chance to pass her ability to the baby. This chance does not apply if Ditto is one of the parents. Balancing Your Team Plan out your team so that each Pok\u00e9mon has a role. Look at the stats and moves of each  Pok\u00e9mon to determine whether it's a good fit for a given role. Consider the following formula:\nPhysical Sweeper (Pok\u00e9mon with high Attack stat)\nSpecial Sweeper (Pok\u00e9mon with high Special Attack stat)\nPhysical Wall (Pok\u00e9mon with high Defense, who can soak up damage)\nSpecial Wall (Same as Physical Wall, but for Special Defense)\nLead (Pok\u00e9mon who sets up entry hazards or field conditions early in the game.) Crippler (Pok\u00e9mon who inflicts status conditions, then switches out to a Sweeper) Choose your Pok\u00e9mon's moves. Be sure that the moves that you're assigning them are compatible. Except in some circumstances, do not have two moves of the same type on one Pok\u00e9mon, such as Surf and Hydro Pump. This is because you will want to ensure that your Pok\u00e9mon can defeat as many types of Pok\u00e9mon as possible. Stat boosters and restoration moves are OK (Synthesis, Aromatherapy, Growth and Petal Dance are all Grass-type moves, but only one is used for attacking), as are moves like Flamethrower and Overheat, which can be used in different circumstances. An attacking Pok\u00e9mon should have a strong move/moves of its own type, as it will get a boost to this move's power (called Same Type Attack Bonus or STAB). It should also have coverage moves that can hit different types than your main attack, otherwise your Pok\u00e9mon will be walled by certain types. Some attackers can use a set-up move which can bring its power up to ridiculous amounts, others might use some support move, healing, or switching moves like U-Turn. Priority is also a good idea, because moves of a higher priority will always go before moves of a lower priority. Your team's tank should be a hardy Pok\u00e9mon with high HP that can take a lot of damage while you heal and manage your other Pok\u00e9mon. Tanks should have moves like healing, Taunt, Protect or Substitute, or status. Moves like Aromatherapy or Wish that help your teammates are good too. Support Pok\u00e9mon use status moves to cripple opposing Pok\u00e9mon, get rid of threats like set-up sweepers, get rid of entry hazards, or help your team. Choose a strong lead Pok\u00e9mon. This is the one that you usually send out first. They are usually fast, so that they can put out delayed moves and other hazards before your opponent can do anything. Sometimes, leads are bulky so that they can set up hazards multiple times throughout the match. They can carry an entry hazard, like Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes, set up a beneficial field condition, like weather, Reflect and Light Screen, or Trick Room, or Baton Pass boosts to another teammate. They also usually have moves to disrupt your opponent, status, or phasing, as well as an attack so they will not be completely useless once hit with Taunt. Don't fixate on brute power. Remember that competitive battling isn't just about wiping out your opponent; it's about strategy and prediction, too. Be sure that you can lay traps (e.g. Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes). Have stat boosting moves such as Swords Dance. It may not look like much, as you may just want to attack as soon as possible, but Swords Dance doubles your Pok\u00e9mon's Attack power. Even if it just adds 50%, try it anyway. Use moves with added effects, such as Flamethrower and Blizzard, which respectively have a chance of burning and freezing the target. Make sure that the moves you use are complemented by the Pok\u00e9mon's stats. For example, using Flamethrower and Blizzard with a Pok\u00e9mon that has a low special attack stat wouldn't be a good idea. Keep in mind that many Pok\u00e9mon aren't offensively inclined. These Pok\u00e9mon would likely be most effective with status moves that cause these effects, as they wouldn't do much damage with physical or special attacks. Check your team for weaknesses. If you see that half of the Pok\u00e9mon have a weakness to one type, then switch out at least one Pok\u00e9mon. Don't try to change the moveset, because you won't fix the problem and end up wasting a move slot. For example, giving your Pok\u00e9mon a Water-type move won't help with a Gallade with Fire Punch. You need to switch out one of your Pok\u00e9mon for a Water-type to solve this. Choosing for Type Plan out your team based on type. Gym leaders and certain types of themed trainers often structure their teams around a certain type of Pok\u00e9mon: water, electric, poison, etc. However, a single-type team isn't very balanced. Prepare your team to fight many types of Pok\u00e9mon. You should have Pok\u00e9mon on your team that are strong against most of the main types\u2014even several of the most common types. Choose a few Pok\u00e9mon from the classic elemental types. A balanced team might include a Fire Pok\u00e9mon, a Water Pok\u00e9mon, and a Grass Pok\u00e9mon. The three Starter Pok\u00e9mon always give you a choice between Fire, Water, and Grass. For instance, in Pok\u00e9mon X/Y, the Grass starter is Chespin, the Fire starter is Fennekin, and the Water starter is Froakie. No matter which starter you choose, however, you'll have the chance to acquire the other \"starter\" types in the wild or through trades. Fire Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass, ice, bug, and steel types, but weak against water,  dragon, and rock Pok\u00e9mon. Water Pok\u00e9mon are strong against fire, ground, and rock types, and weak against electric, grass,  and dragon types. Grass type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against water, ground, and rock types, but weak against fire, poison, flying, bug and dragon types. Consider Pok\u00e9mon from other common types. You will probably encounter Bug, Flying, Poison, Psychic, and Electric Pok\u00e9mon in the early game and throughout your adventure. This is not to say that they cannot be very powerful! Flying Pok\u00e9mon, in particular, can be useful for quick transport as well as strong, hard-to-counter Flying-type attacks. Electric Pok\u00e9mon are strong against water and flying Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against grass, electric, ground, and dragon types. Flying type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass, fighting, and bug types, but weak against electric, rock, and ice types. Bug type are strong against Grass, Psychic, and Dark, and weak against Fire, Flying and psychic. Poison type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass and fairy, but weak against ground, rock, psychic and steel types. Psychic type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against fighting and poison types and ghost types, but weak against ghost, dark, and steel Pok\u00e9mon. Try to use at least one resilient, physically-strong Pok\u00e9mon. Ground and Rock types are resistant to a wide variety of common types, although they do have their weaknesses. Their defensive stats are usually high, which balances out the weaknesses of some other Pok\u00e9mon. Fighting types are strong against some of the physical and commonly \"hard to hurt\" types, although they are open to great damage from special attack-prone types. Ground type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against fire, poison, electric, rock, and steel types, but weak against grass, flying, and water types. Rock type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ice, fire, flying, and bug types, but weak against fighting, ground, and steel types. Ice type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass, ground, flying, grass and dragon Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against fighting, fire, and steel. Fighting Pok\u00e9mon are strong against normal, ice, rock, dark, and steel Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against poison, flying, bug, ghost, fairy, and psychic types. Avoid Normal types, in general. Some Normal Pok\u00e9mon can grow to become very powerful, but they won't give you a significant leg up over any other type. Normal type Pok\u00e9mon are not statistically stronger against any other type, and they are weak against fighting, ghost, rock, and steel. The upside of Normal Pok\u00e9mon is that they are versatile: they can often learn TM moves from diverse other types. Select less common types for special effect. Dark, Dragon, Ghost, and Fairy are relatively rare in the Pok\u00e9mon world, but these types can be some of the most powerful fighters when used in combination with hardier and more common teammates. Dark type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ghost and psychic Pok\u00e9mon, and weak against fighting, fairy, and bug Pok\u00e9mon. Dragon type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against other dragon types, but weak against ice, fairy, and its own type. Ghost type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ghost and psychic types, but weak against dark and psychic types. Fairy types are strong against dragon, fighting, and dark, and weak against poison and steel. They are resisted by fairy and fire. Steel type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ice, fairy, and rock Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against water, fire, and steel. Training Your Pok\u00e9mon Train Pok\u00e9mon through battles. This is more effective at increasing happiness and raising the strength of your Pok\u00e9mon than if you use rare candies to gain levels quickly. For competitions, make sure all your Pok\u00e9mon are trained to level 100. Otherwise, they will be at a big disadvantage. Understand and utilize Effort Values (EVs). These are points that your Pok\u00e9mon gain for defeating other Pok\u00e9mon, whether it's in a trainer battle or in the wild. EVs are essential to raising strong Pok\u00e9mon. Certain Pok\u00e9mon give different EVs, so you should make sure you only train against Pok\u00e9mon who give the right EVs, instead of just randomly. Note that you will not receive EVs in a link battle with friends or in the Battle Tower/Battle Subway. Consider the following list of Pok\u00e9mon according to EV: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_effort_value_yield\nYou can have a maximum of 255 EVs per stat, and 510 EVs total on all stats. With every 4 EV points in a stat, it gains 1 stat point at level 100. This means that the maximum amount of EVs that can be used to increase a Pok\u00e9mon's stats is 508. Because of this, do not give 255 EVs to a stat, but 252. This way, you have 4 extra EV's which can be used to increase another stat by one point. It is usually a good idea to max out the EVs for a Pok\u00e9mon's most important stat. However, in certain cases you can use less \u2013 such as if your Pok\u00e9mon only needs a certain Speed stat to outspeed a common threat. Figure out which stats you want to develop on your Pok\u00e9mon, and figure out how many and which Pok\u00e9mon you need to fight to reach those EVs. Make sure to keep a log of your progress. Consider logging stats in a spreadsheet so that you don't lose track. Use vitamins to supplement EV training. Buy as many vitamins (e.g. Protein, Carbos) for your Pok\u00e9mon as you can, and use them before EV training. Each vitamin that you give to your Pok\u00e9mon will increase its EVs by 10 in a certain stat. Vitamins can only be used for the first 100 EVs. If you have 100 EVs or more, vitamins will have no effect. For example, Carbos gives your Pok\u00e9mon 10 Speed EVs. If you use 10 Carbos with no previously gained Speed EVs, your Pok\u00e9mon will gain 100 Speed EVs. If you already have 10 Speed EVs, you may use 9 Carbos. If you have 99, you may use 1 Carbos, and it will only give you 1 EV. Remember to give your Pok\u00e9mon EVs that they can use. For example, don't give an Alakazam Attack EVs, because they are not physical attackers. Use items to accelerate the level-up process. If you're going to battle online, EV train beforehand using Power Items. Use the Experience Share or Macho Brace during early levels. The Macho Brace will double the EVs you receive from each Pok\u00e9mon you battle, but it halves speed while it is held. Give your Pok\u00e9mon Pok\u00e9rus, if you have access to it. This also doubles the EVs, but without the speed depletion. If your Pok\u00e9mon's Pok\u00e9rus is gone, don't worry because that just means it can't be spread. The effects of Pok\u00e9rus will remain forever. This results in your Pok\u00e9mon getting EVs quicker. Use held items to prepare your team for battle. Sweepers should hold an item to increase their attacking stats, like Life Orb, a Choice item, or Expert Belt. Assault Vest can be used for more bulky attackers, and Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed opposing Pok\u00e9mon, or can be Tricked onto another Pok\u00e9mon to lock them into a move. Defensive Pok\u00e9mon can use Leftovers to increase their longevity. Poison types can use Black Sludge instead, in case their item is stolen. Pok\u00e9mon that can Mega Evolve will need their corresponding mega stone to Mega Evolve, and certain other items can be useful on specialized sets.",

        "You need to switch out one of your Pok\u00e9mon for a Water-type to solve this.",
        "Choosing for Type Plan out your team based on type.",
        "Gym leaders and certain types of themed trainers often structure their teams around a certain type of Pok\u00e9mon: water, electric, poison, etc.",
        "However, a single-type team isn't very balanced.",
        "Prepare your team to fight many types of Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "You should have Pok\u00e9mon on your team that are strong against most of the main types\u2014even several of the most common types.",
        "Choose a few Pok\u00e9mon from the classic elemental types.",
        "A balanced team might include a Fire Pok\u00e9mon, a Water Pok\u00e9mon, and a Grass Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "The three Starter Pok\u00e9mon always give you a choice between Fire, Water, and Grass.",
        "For instance, in Pok\u00e9mon X/Y, the Grass starter is Chespin, the Fire starter is Fennekin, and the Water starter is Froakie.",
        "No matter which starter you choose, however, you'll have the chance to acquire the other \"starter\" types in the wild or through trades.",
        "Fire Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass, ice, bug, and steel types, but weak against water,  dragon, and rock Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "Water Pok\u00e9mon are strong against fire, ground, and rock types, and weak against electric, grass,  and dragon types.",
        "Grass type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against water, ground, and rock types, but weak against fire, poison, flying, bug and dragon types.",
        "Consider Pok\u00e9mon from other common types.",
        "You will probably encounter Bug, Flying, Poison, Psychic, and Electric Pok\u00e9mon in the early game and throughout your adventure.",
        "This is not to say that they cannot be very powerful!",
        "Flying Pok\u00e9mon, in particular, can be useful for quick transport as well as strong, hard-to-counter Flying-type attacks.",
        "Electric Pok\u00e9mon are strong against water and flying Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against grass, electric, ground, and dragon types.",
        "Flying type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass, fighting, and bug types, but weak against electric, rock, and ice types.",
        "Bug type are strong against Grass, Psychic, and Dark, and weak against Fire, Flying and psychic.",
        "Poison type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass and fairy, but weak against ground, rock, psychic and steel types.",
        "Psychic type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against fighting and poison types and ghost types, but weak against ghost, dark, and steel Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "Try to use at least one resilient, physically-strong Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "Ground and Rock types are resistant to a wide variety of common types, although they do have their weaknesses.",
        "Their defensive stats are usually high, which balances out the weaknesses of some other Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "Fighting types are strong against some of the physical and commonly \"hard to hurt\" types, although they are open to great damage from special attack-prone types.",
        "Ground type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against fire, poison, electric, rock, and steel types, but weak against grass, flying, and water types.",
        "Rock type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ice, fire, flying, and bug types, but weak against fighting, ground, and steel types.",
        "Ice type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against grass, ground, flying, grass and dragon Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against fighting, fire, and steel.",
        "Fighting Pok\u00e9mon are strong against normal, ice, rock, dark, and steel Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against poison, flying, bug, ghost, fairy, and psychic types.",
        "Avoid Normal types, in general.",
        "Some Normal Pok\u00e9mon can grow to become very powerful, but they won't give you a significant leg up over any other type.",
        "Normal type Pok\u00e9mon are not statistically stronger against any other type, and they are weak against fighting, ghost, rock, and steel.",
        "The upside of Normal Pok\u00e9mon is that they are versatile: they can often learn TM moves from diverse other types.",
        "Select less common types for special effect.",
        "Dark, Dragon, Ghost, and Fairy are relatively rare in the Pok\u00e9mon world, but these types can be some of the most powerful fighters when used in combination with hardier and more common teammates.",
        "Dark type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ghost and psychic Pok\u00e9mon, and weak against fighting, fairy, and bug Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "Dragon type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against other dragon types, but weak against ice, fairy, and its own type.",
        "Ghost type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ghost and psychic types, but weak against dark and psychic types.",
        "Fairy types are strong against dragon, fighting, and dark, and weak against poison and steel.",
        "They are resisted by fairy and fire.",
        "Steel type Pok\u00e9mon are strong against ice, fairy, and rock Pok\u00e9mon, but weak against water, fire, and steel.",
        "Training Your Pok\u00e9mon Train Pok\u00e9mon through battles.",
        "This is more effective at increasing happiness and raising the strength of your Pok\u00e9mon than if you use rare candies to gain levels quickly.",
        "For competitions, make sure all your Pok\u00e9mon are trained to level 100.",
        "Otherwise, they will be at a big disadvantage.",
        "Understand and utilize Effort Values (EVs).",
        "These are points that your Pok\u00e9mon gain for defeating other Pok\u00e9mon, whether it's in a trainer battle or in the wild.",
        "EVs are essential to raising strong Pok\u00e9mon.",
        "Certain Pok\u00e9mon give different EVs, so you should make sure you only train against Pok\u00e9mon who give the right EVs, instead of just randomly.",
        "Note that you will not receive EVs in a link battle with friends or in the Battle Tower/Battle Subway.",
        "Consider the following list of Pok\u00e9mon according to EV: http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_effort_value_yield\nYou can have a maximum of 255 EVs per stat, and 510 EVs total on all stats.",
        "With every 4 EV points in a stat, it gains 1 stat point at level 100.",
        "This means that the maximum amount of EVs that can be used to increase a Pok\u00e9mon's stats is 508.",
        "Because of this, do not give 255 EVs to a stat, but 252.",
        "This way, you have 4 extra EV's which can be used to increase another stat by one point.",
        "It is usually a good idea to max out the EVs for a Pok\u00e9mon's most important stat.",
        "However, in certain cases you can use less \u2013 such as if your Pok\u00e9mon only needs a certain Speed stat to outspeed a common threat.",
        "Figure out which stats you want to develop on your Pok\u00e9mon, and figure out how many and which Pok\u00e9mon you need to fight to reach those EVs.",
        "Make sure to keep a log of your progress.",
        "Consider logging stats in a spreadsheet so that you don't lose track.",
        "Use vitamins to supplement EV training.",
        "Buy as many vitamins (e.g.",
        "Protein, Carbos) for your Pok\u00e9mon as you can, and use them before EV training.",
        "Each vitamin that you give to your Pok\u00e9mon will increase its EVs by 10 in a certain stat.",
        "Vitamins can only be used for the first 100 EVs.",
        "If you have 100 EVs or more, vitamins will have no effect.",
        "For example, Carbos gives your Pok\u00e9mon 10 Speed EVs.",
        "If you use 10 Carbos with no previously gained Speed EVs, your Pok\u00e9mon will gain 100 Speed EVs.",
        "If you already have 10 Speed EVs, you may use 9 Carbos.",
        "If you have 99, you may use 1 Carbos, and it will only give you 1 EV.",
        "Remember to give your Pok\u00e9mon EVs that they can use.",
        "For example, don't give an Alakazam Attack EVs, because they are not physical attackers.",
        "Use items to accelerate the level-up process.",
        "If you're going to battle online, EV train beforehand using Power Items.",
        "Use the Experience Share or Macho Brace during early levels.",
        "The Macho Brace will double the EVs you receive from each Pok\u00e9mon you battle, but it halves speed while it is held.",
        "Give your Pok\u00e9mon Pok\u00e9rus, if you have access to it.",
        "This also doubles the EVs, but without the speed depletion.",
        "If your Pok\u00e9mon's Pok\u00e9rus is gone, don't worry because that just means it can't be spread.",
        "The effects of Pok\u00e9rus will remain forever.",
        "This results in your Pok\u00e9mon getting EVs quicker.",
        "Use held items to prepare your team for battle.",
        "Sweepers should hold an item to increase their attacking stats, like Life Orb, a Choice item, or Expert Belt.",
        "Assault Vest can be used for more bulky attackers, and Choice Scarf can be used to outspeed opposing Pok\u00e9mon, or can be Tricked onto another Pok\u00e9mon to lock them into a move.",
        "Defensive Pok\u00e9mon can use Leftovers to increase their longevity.",
        "Poison types can use Black Sludge instead, in case their item is stolen.",
        "Pok\u00e9mon that can Mega Evolve will need their corresponding mega stone to Mega Evolve, and certain other items can be useful on specialized sets."
