Don\u2019t pull hard enough that the horse starts to balk. Just pull the line tight so there\u2019s no slack and you\u2019re sure the horse can feel the pressure. If you\u2019re having trouble getting the horse\u2019s attention, give the rope one firm shake. This is known as \u201cbumping the rope\u201d and will often cause the horse to look at you."

If the horse doesn\u2019t respond after a few seconds, shake the rope a little harder. Working the rope from side to side will make the horse want to move its feet, and the forward pressure on the rope should encourage it to step backward. It\u2019s unlikely that the horse will respond to a light shake at first, but you should always start this exercise as gently as possible. That way, the horse can eventually learn to respond to a light cue. You can escalate as needed, but if you start too strong, the horse will expect that level of energy each time. Tip: Experiment with different techniques, including tapping the rope with a clinician\u2019s stick, wiggling the stick in front of the horse, or even waving your hands to drive the horse backward."

It\u2019s important to build a foundation where the horse understands what you expect. The moment you see the horse move its feet backward, let some of the slack back into the lead rope. Don\u2019t let go of the rope entirely, but hold it loosely so the horse feels the pressure release. It\u2019s the release of pressure that acts as a reward for the horse when it steps backward. If you don\u2019t immediately reward the horse, it won\u2019t know that it did the right thing, so it will be less likely to repeat that behavior. It's okay if the horse keeps backing up even after you lighten the pressure on the rope. In most cases, the horse will stop doing this once it becomes more familiar with the training.

        "You want the horse to follow your directions willingly, not out of fear.",
        "Continue practicing each day for about 10-20 minutes at a time.",
        "You\u2019ll see better results in training your horse if you do groundwork exercises every day.",
        "If the horse seems very comfortable backing up, you don\u2019t necessarily have to devote all of your groundwork time to backing.",
        "However, this is a skill that will act as a building block for other exercises, so it\u2019s important to spend time making sure your horse can back well.",
        "Even after you\u2019ve moved on to other training exercises, continue to work on backing a few times a week.",
        "With enough practice, you should be able to get the horse to back just by shaking the lead rope, no matter where you are.",
        "Backing up in Close Quarters Stand close to the horse, but slightly off to the side.",
        "Hold the lead rope in your right hand and stand slightly to the left of the horse\u2019s head.",
        "Standing to the side of the horse is less dangerous than standing directly in front of it, because the horse will be able to see you better.",
        "It will also be harder for the horse to kick you if it gets upset.",
        "If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need the horse to back up but you don\u2019t have room to wiggle the lead rope, this exercise will be useful.",
        "Tap the horse on the side to get it to step sideways.",
        "Lightly push or tap the horse on one side of its hind end, and continue until the horse takes a step sideways.",
        "This is called \u201cdisengaging the horse\u2019s hindquarters,\u201d and it helps the horse feel more inclined to move around.",
        "Some horses will balk if you try to get them to back up.",
        "By disengaging its hindquarters first, you\u2019re putting energy into its feet.",
        "This can help keep the horse from getting stuck or refusing to move.",
        "Pull the lead rope back and to the side.",
        "With light pressure, pull the lead rope back toward the horse\u2019s hindquarters.",
        "Depending on how the horse moved when you disengaged its hindquarters, you can pull the rope toward whichever side is more convenient.",
        "Apply light, steady pressure, gently increasing the tension in the rope until the horse steps backward.",
        "Start off by only expecting 1-2 good backward steps.",
        "Tip: At first, you may end up pulling hard on the rope.",
        "However, always start gently, since you want the horse to learn to respond to the lightest pressure possible.",
        "Release the pressure as soon as the horse steps backward.",
        "As soon as you see the horse take a step backward, it\u2019s important to reward its behavior.",
        "The way you show the horse that it\u2019s done a good job is to lighten the tension in the lead rope.",
        "If you\u2019re pulling toward the horse\u2019s hind end, relaxing your arm and moving your hand toward the horse\u2019s head should release the tension in the rope.",
        "Pet the horse's head and hind end to desensitize it.",
        "Horses are very sensitive to touch.",
        "If you\u2019re using physical cues to train it, it can sometimes help to stroke or rub the horse afterward to help it relax.",
        "First, stroke the horse on its nose, then reach back and pat it on the hindquarters.",
        "This also helps the horse know that it\u2019s doing a good job."
