If you don\u2019t have any preferences and want to pair your essential oil with a one-dimensional carrier oil, opt for sweet almond or olive oil. Some essential oil enthusiasts dislike the thickness and texture of some olive oils. If you tend to dislike foods that rely on olive oil, try using sweet almond oil instead. Olive oil has a 2-year shelf life, while sweet almond oil usually won\u2019t be good for more than 10 months. Apricot oil is a good alternative to almond oil if you enjoy fruitier scents. It can be a little more expensive, though. Apricot oil has a shelf life of 1 year.

Jojoba oil is incredibly close to the natural oils on human skin, which makes it a good choice if you want an inoffensive option. Primrose oil is rich in nutrients that keep skin healthy, but it can be quite expensive. Marula, rosehip, and Argan oil are all rich in antioxidants, which make them great for facial treatments. These oils have a shelf life of 2 years, although it is recommended that you use marula oil within 6 months of the bottling date. Avocado oil has a shelf life of 1 year, jojoba oil will last 5 years, while primrose oil will only last for 6-9 months. Fractionated coconut oil, which will last for 2 years, is a good option for skin treatments if you prefer a thinner texture.

If you think it will make a good pairing with an essential oil, try it out! Common carrier oils include olive oil, apricot oil, almond oil, coconut oil, and jojoba oil.

Oils can be tricky and annoying to clean up. Use an empty dropper bottle to store your mixture if you plan on mixing your solution with something else.
