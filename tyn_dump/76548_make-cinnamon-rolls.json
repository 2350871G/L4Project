Mix the ingredients on low for 5 minutes until the dough becomes shiny in appearance. If the dough looks too wet, add about 2 tablespoons more of flour to the bowl and mix again. Turn off the mixer. Scrape the dough from the hook. Knead the dough. Place your dough inside a bowl you have lightly floured and begin spreading it out with your palms, folding it back in on itself and spreading it out again. Add flour as needed. Return the dough to the bowl. Cover it and let it rise for about 1 hour or until it has doubled its size. Make the filling. While the dough is rising, place the brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter into a small mixing bowl. Mix with a spoon until combined, and set it aside. Preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C/ 375\u00baF.  Roll the dough. Once the dough has risen, remove the cover and punch the air out of the dough. Sprinkle a flat, clean work surface with flour and place the dough on it. Sprinkle the dough with some flour. Roll out the dough to a 1/2 cm (1/5 inch) thickness, making sure there is enough flour to prevent it from sticking to the table. Spread the filling on the dough. Carefully roll the dough into a log. Cut the roll into slices of about 3 cm (1.18\") in thickness. Place the sliced rolls on the greased baking tray or sheet, leaving enough space for the rolls to rise. Cover again and allow them to rise for 15-20 minutes. Add the egg wash. Take the egg wash and using the pastry brush, paint each roll individually.  Put the tray into the oven. Let the rolls bake for 12-15 minutes. Let the rolls rest for 10 - 15 minutes to cool. Your cinnamon rolls are now ready to serve! They can be eaten cold but they taste especially good warm. Try them both ways! Version 2 \u2013 Raisins and walnuts Sift the flour three times. Measure 2 3/4 cups of flour from the final sifting. If using a bread machine, do the following: Measure all ingredients into bread pan, placing the wet ingredients in first. Make a \"well\" or indented spot for the yeast on top of all the other ingredients. Place the bread pan into the bread machine. Select dough setting.

Place dough into a clean bowl and knead it, using oiled or floured hands to move the dough around several times. Cover the dough and let it sit in a warm or room temperature spot for at least 30 minutes. The dough should double in size before shaping. A clean tea towel makes a good cover. Mix the filling ingredients together in a bowl while you wait and set aside. Lightly grease baking pans while waiting. Preheat your oven to 375* F / 190* C.  Place dough on a clean, lightly floured surface. Punch the dough down with clean hands. Place down on surface and pound down or roll out until you get the shape of an even rectangle. After it forms a rectangular shape, apply the melted butter to one side of the dough. Brush on or apply with another tool. Make sure it's evenly applied and use all of the butter. Apply cinnamon evenly coated and then add the sugar on top. Roll it up evenly from the longest side and roll down towards you. You should have a long cylinder. Cut the dough up into pieces.

If you need more milk to make it soupier, feel free to add more, but only add a little bit in at a time. Blend until smooth. Spread or drizzle the glaze over the rolls after you take them out of the oven. Enjoy! Finished.  Mini Cinnamon Rolls Spread butter over a piece of bread.  Sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the butter and bread.  Roll the bread the short way.  Cut three or four pieces of the bread.  Put the pieces on a plate.  Repeat for however many rolls you want to make.
