A good rule of thumb is to do it once in the morning, once around lunch, and once before you go to sleep. This helps to ensure that you break up treatment equally throughout the day. Saline solutions are recommended for post-tattoo treatment, to reduce the chance of infection. Dab a clean cloth soaked in the solution onto the area to keep a fresh tattoo sterile. Saline solutions have also been known to help sterilize small wounds, such as piercings and minor infections on the hands, which may be easier to treat by dipping the affected area into a shallow cup. You can store the excess solution at room temperature in a sealed container to use for repeat treatments or for the future. The solution should last indefinitely as long as it remains in a sealed container."
