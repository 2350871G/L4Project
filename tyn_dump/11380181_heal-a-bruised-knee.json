Don\u2019t put the ice directly onto the skin of your knee, instead, wrap it in a towel first. Keep the ice on your knee for 15 minutes, once an hour, until the swelling is reduced or the pain has subsided. Ice packs or other frozen items (such as a bag of peas or corn) can work as well.

Acetaminophen, or Tylenol, can be used for pain and ibuprofen, or Advil, can be used to reduce swelling.
