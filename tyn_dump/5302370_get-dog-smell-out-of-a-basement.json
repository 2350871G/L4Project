For people whose dog spends a lot of time in their basement, figuring out how to remove the urine smell from concrete or cement can be tricky. The first thing you\u2019ll need to do is locate the source of the urine smell. If you catch your dog in the act, or shortly after, this will be easy, you just look for the wet spot on your cement. However, dried stains can be harder to find. To find a dried urine stain, look for any areas that are discolored or any rings on your floor caused by a puddle of liquid. If you are unable to locate the source, try using a blacklight to identify any previously soiled areas."

For example, if you notice a particularly muddy portion of trail on your walk, take your dog out and around it. Also, try to keep it away from anything smelly it might roll in, like dead animals or other animal waste. Preventing odors on your dog before they happen can reduce the amount of clean up you have to do later. Remember that dogs will be dogs and you won\u2019t be able to prevent your dog from getting messy once in a while. Do what you can to keep it clean, but don\u2019t keep your dog from following their natural instincts.",

        "Clean up any liquid.",

        "Most pet supply stores carry pet-safe enzyme-based cleaners.",

        "As with concrete, your first task is to locate the source of the smell.",
        "If your dog has just gone to the bathroom, the carpeting will be wet.",
        "If it is an old stain, however, look for patches of carpet that are discolored or somewhat stiff to your touch.",
        "Blot the urine-soaked area.",
        "Use paper towels, a wadded up newspaper, or fabric towels to blot the area where your dog has peed in order to clean up as much liquid as possible.",
        "To do so, apply as much pressure as possible to the wet area (you may try walking or standing on top of the towels).",
        "Switch out your towels as they become wet, continuing this blotting process until the towels remain dry.",
        "If possible, pull back the carpet in the urine-soaked area and place towels both underneath and on top of the carpet.",

        "After you have blotted the floor with a damp paper towel, sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda over the stained area.",

        "Once the cleaner has been on the spot for the recommended amount of time, blot up any excess with a towel.",

        "Repeat the previous two steps as needed.",
        "If the stain was not removed completely the first time, continue to apply your enzymatic cleaner and blot up the excess until the stain is gone.",
        "If you are repeating these steps, but the stain is not getting any lighter, you have removed as much of the stain as possible.",

        "Vacuum bi-weekly.",
