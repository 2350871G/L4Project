Keep in mind that each fountain pen requires a slightly different angle at which the tines and feed separate. You will learn to recognize this through practice. Some nibs have been modified by technicians to accommodate angles ranging from 35 degrees to nearly 90 degrees. The feel will be different than that of a ball-point pen, which is designed to write from various angles, including vertical. A vertical fountain pen does not utilize the full width of the nib (the tip of the pen)."
