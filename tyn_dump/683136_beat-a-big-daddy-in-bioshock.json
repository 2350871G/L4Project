Those explosive rounds will deal a considerable amount of damage and set the Big Daddy on fire. But make sure you have a vantage point or some cover after you shoot your first shell, because explosions don't slow down these monsters."

If there is a nearby puddle, you can deal even more damage by using the water as an amplifier for the electricity. This tactic usually eats up more ammo than other ways, but it leaves you with less damage done in the end."

The only real use for these mines is to set up a perimeter, and when a perimeter is needed in the game there are usually turrets and cameras provided. Simply stick 3 or 4 proximity mines on a telekinetically-moveable object (an oxygen tank would be most effective) and pick it up using your Telekinesis. Hurling the bomb at the Big Daddy will certainly ruin its day, if not kill it completely. If the monster survives the initial explosion, finish off its few remaining health with any ammunition you choose (armor-piercing bullets are best)."

Once you are above the Big Daddy, through means of winding stairs or a balcony, start off with a frag grenade. This will surely get the Big Daddy angry, which causes him to get closer to either charge or shoot you. He'll take the quickest route to you, so keep  him in sight as you launch RPGs at him. This should be able to kill him, unless he gets behind cover. If that's the case, find another spot to start, or he'll find you. Avoid using RPGs against an unaware Big Daddy, because they are far more expensive than the standard frag grenade, but just slightly weaker."

When the Big Daddy attacks, your Big Daddy defends you. Once the dust settles, you may find your Daddy won, or the other did. Either way, finish off the survivor with the shotgun or other weapon and claim your prize of the little sister and a wallet-full of cash."

Find a suitable hallway and proceed to shoot the trap bolts so they make a corridor of electricity. Once this is done, lure a Big Daddy (by either angering or hypnotizing it) through the shocking pathway. To avoid setting off the wires yourself, crouch as you walk to avoid wires shot at chest-level."
