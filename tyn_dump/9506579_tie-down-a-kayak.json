Use bow and stern lines with a cam buckle or ratchet attached so you can easily tighten them into place. You can find bow and stern lines online or at your local sporting goods store. Tying Your Kayak to the Roof Rack Lift your kayak onto the roof rack on your car so it's right side up. You may need someone to help you lift it. The bow (front) of your kayak should be at the front of your car, and the stern (back) of your kayak should be at the back. Center your kayak on the roof rack. Move the kayak forward or back on the roof rack as needed until the middle of the kayak is centered between the two roof rack bars. Then, make sure the kayak is centered between the two sides of your car. You don\u2019t want your kayak to be closer to one side of the car than the other.

Throw the bare end of the strap across the kayak to the other side. If you have someone helping you, they can stand on the other side and grab the strap when you throw it. Otherwise, walk around to the other side of your car and grab the end of the strap you just threw over. Loop the bare end you just threw over under the same roof rack bar. You should use the same roof rack bar, but on the opposite side of the kayak. Loop it under the same way you did on the other side of the car. Run the bare end of the strap through the cam buckle. This will close off the strap and secure your kayak to the roof rack bar you\u2019re working on. Insert the bare end of the strap through the slot in the cam buckle and pull it through with your hand. Keep pulling the strap through until all of the slack is through the cam buckle. Tighten the strap with the cam buckle so your kayak is secure. To tighten the strap, pull on the bare end of the strap so more slack comes through the cam buckle. You want the strap tight enough that your kayak won\u2019t shift around while you\u2019re driving, but not so tight that you damage your kayak. Do the same thing with the other strap on the second roof rack bar. Loop the bare end of the strap under the bar, throw it over the kayak to the other side, loop it under the bar again, and then run it through the cam buckle. Tighten the strap so your kayak is secure. Prevent damage by wrapping the strap ends around the roof rack bars. After you wrap the ends around the bars, tie several secure knots so they stay in place. If you drive with the ends loose, they could get stuck in your tires and cause your kayak and roof rack to rip off your car. Tying Down the Bow and Stern Hook the end of a bow line to the front end of your kayak. Insert the hook at the end of the bow line through the loop on the carrying handle at the end of your kayak. Make sure the hook is secure. Hook the other end of the bow line to the tow hook under your bumper. The tow hook should look like a small metal ring underneath the bumper on your car. Don\u2019t hook the bow line to the plastic part of your bumper or you could damage your car. If your car doesn\u2019t have a tow hook, you may need to get a hood loop strap to use instead. Hood loop straps attach to the bolt heads under your hood. After you\u2019ve bolted it on, close the hood so the fabric loop part of the strap is sticking out from the hood. Hook the bow line to that loop. Tighten the bow line. If your bow line has a cam buckle, pull the line through the cam buckle to tighten the line. If your bow line has a ratchet, crank the ratchet up and down until the line is tightened. Don\u2019t make the bow line too tight or you could damage your kayak. You should still be able to move your kayak up and down on the roof of your car with your hand. Repeat on the back of your kayak and car with a stern line. Hook the end of the stern line to the carrying handle on the back end of your kayak. Then, hook the other end of the line to the tow hook underneath your back bumper, or to the hitch on your car. If you don\u2019t have a tow hook or hitch, you may need to install a hitch so you have something to hook the stern line to. Secure the loose ends to the rest of the line. Take the loose ends of the bow and stern lines and wrap them around the rest of the line. Once all the slack is wrapped up, tie multiple knots so the loose ends don't come unraveled.
