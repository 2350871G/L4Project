Choose a colour that will compliment your photo. Black and white photos look great in brightly coloured frames and coloured photos tend to look good in paler coloured frames. A 6 in (15 cm) square of paper makes a frame that is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and high. Similarly, an 8 in (20 cm) square of paper makes a frame that is about 4 inches (10 cm) high and wide. Origami paper works best for this activity, as it has 1 coloured side and 1 blank (or different coloured) side. This helps to create a frame with different colours in it. However, regular paper will also work."
