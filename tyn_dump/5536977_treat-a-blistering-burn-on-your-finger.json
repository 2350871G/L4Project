You can also wrap it in a towel soaked with cool tap water for the same amount of time, or submerge the body part in a container of water if you don't have access to a running tap. This can minimize pain, decrease swelling, and prevent tissue damage. Avoid placing your finger under cold or warm water or in ice. This can make the burning and blistering worse.
