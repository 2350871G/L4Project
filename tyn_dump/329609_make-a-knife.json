Get creative with your blade design, but keep functionality and practicality in mind. Decide on blade length. The length of the blade is largely a personal preference, though large blades can be unwieldy and require lots of steel. Design the tang. The tang is the piece of the blade that attaches to the handle. The easiest method is known as the \u201cfull tang.\u201d The tang will be the same thickness as the knife, and the handle is formed by attaching a piece of wood to each side with rivets.

Make adjustments to the size as necessary once you see the outline on the metal. Assemble your tools. You will need a hacksaw, an angle grinder with a hard wheel and flap wheel, a vise, a drill, and protective wear also a few other tools you could have are bandsaw and a grizzly or KMG grinder. You will need several replacement blades for the saw. Cut the Steel Use the hacksaw to cut the metal. Cut a rectangle around your traced blade to separate it from the main slab. You will need a stiffer hacksaw for thicker steel. This rectangle is what you will grind down to form the profile of the blade. Grind the profile. Put the rough cut blade into a vise and grind away excess metal. Follow the guidelines to form the profile. Use the grinder to finalize the shape of the blade. Grind the edge. Gently grind the edge into a slope with the flap wheel. Make sure that the slope does not go past the middle of the blade. Make this slope on each side of the blade. Doing this forms the actual edge of the blade. Go slowly during this step, as grinding too much can ruin the blade, forcing you to start over. Drill your rivet holes. Use a drill bit that is the same size as the rivets that you intend to use. Put the holes in the tang. Depending on the size of the blade, you may need a varying number of holes. Finish the blade.

Once that hour is up, heat treatment is complete. Sand the blade again. Use increasingly finer grits of paper, going past 220 and up to around 400 grit. Polish the blade if you want some extra shine. Attach the Handle Cut out your handle pieces. For a full tang knife, there are two pieces of handle, one on each side. Cut and sand the pieces at the same time to ensure that both sides are symmetrical. Attach the pieces with epoxy. Drill the holes for the rivets on each side. Avoid getting epoxy on the blade, as it can be difficult to remove. Place it in a vise and let it dry overnight. Use a saw to perform the final cuts and adjustments to the handle. Insert the rivets, leaving about an extra 1/8\u201d sticking out each side, and peen them with a ball-peen hammer. File the rivets down and sand the handle. Sharpen the Blade Prepare the sharpening stone. You'll need a large sharpening stone for these steps. Lightly coat the rough side of the stone with sharpening oil. Hold the blade at a 20\u00b0 angle from the surface of the sharpening stone. Push the blade across the stone in a cutting motion. Raise the handle while moving the blade to sharpen all the way to the tip. After a few strokes, flip the blade over to the other side.
