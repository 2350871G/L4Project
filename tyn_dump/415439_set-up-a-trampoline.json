Setting up the Mat Begin setting up the springs with a partner. Having a partner install the springs with you makes properly aligning the mat easier. You and your partner should grab an even amount of springs\u2014four each to start out with is okay. Go to opposite sides of the trampoline. Make sure you are exactly opposite of each other by counting the hooks. Attach the springs evenly with your partner. Begin attaching the springs to their designated hooks. Then, attach the hooks to the metal rings.

Putting Together the Enclosure Net Attach the bungee loops. Not every trampoline will come with an enclosure, but you can choose to purchase one with your trampoline. First, grab your enclosure net and bungee loops. The bungee loops should look rubber band-like. Attach the bungee loops to the net. The loops help keep the net in place when it is being bounced against. Some regulations make it so that enclosures are required for trampolines. Connect and secure the posts. The posts for the net may come in multiple pieces. If so, connect them and then cover them with foam sleeves. Once the posts are connected, use a screwdriver or drill to secure them with screws or bolts, depending on what the package came with. Attach the hooks. Each of the bungee loops should have hooks attached to them. Attach each of the hooks to the holes on top of the posts. Then, lift the posts one by one and place them in the O-rings of the enclosure net. Once the posts are placed in the O-rings, the enclosure net just needs to be lifted to be put in place. Test your finished trampoline. Check everything over once more to make sure the trampoline is secure. Then, get on the trampoline and bounce a few times to make sure it is stable.
