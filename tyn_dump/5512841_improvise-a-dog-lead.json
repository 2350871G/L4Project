                    "description": "Rope is one of the easiest things to improvise a dog lead out of. Just tie the rope or string through the clip of your dog\u2019s harness. Make a simple knot by crossing the loose end of the rope over the long end, then pulling it through the loop. Your dog will never know the difference. The best rope will not be too thick. Rope with a diameter of about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) (\u00bd in) is ideal. Make a loop for the handle on an improvised lead of rope. Fold about 10 cm (4 in) of the lead over onto itself. Tie a loop in the rope or string, then cross the loose end over the main length once again, making a second loop. Pull it taut."

Select a thicker string if possible, especially if you have a strong dog who might break the improvised lead when they pull. If all you have is thin string, twine several equally-long pieces of it together. For instance, you might take three or four strings about 2.4 m (8 ft) long, then twist them along their lengths into a kind of rope-like braid. With your string dog lead in hand, loop one end through the clip of your dog\u2019s harness. Cross the loose end over the main length of the lead and pull it through the loop to secure it."

Making a More Sophisticated Dog Lead Measure and cut your rope. Most dog leads are about 2.4 m (8 ft) long, so cut your rope to that length. Use nylon rope 1 centimeter (0.39 in) (\u00bd in) thick.

Shove the fid between the strand of rope located next to the second one you threaded and the strand directly below it. Pass the final strand through the opening you made with the fid. Continue splicing the strands into the rope. Repeat the splicing pattern three or four more times, gradually moving up the rope (and away from the end of the rope you cut). If you want a larger handle on your lead, weave the unraveled end into the main portion of the rope at a higher point along its length. If you want a smaller handle, weave the unraveled end into the main portion of the rope at a point that is further from the opposite end. Add a clasp to the rope. Lay the opposite end of the rope on a flat surface and curl about 8 cm (3 in) of it around toward the opposite end. Slip a small clasp of the sort used to attach leads to dog harnesses over the short end and position it at the low end of the curve in the rope. Bind the clasp end. Position the rope in such a way that the shorter end curves up and away from you in a \u201cJ\u201d shape.
