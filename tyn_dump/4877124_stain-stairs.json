        "Stripping Old Paint or Stain Apply a chemical stripper for stairs with thick paint or heavy stain.",
        "If the stairs have only 1-2 coats of paint or a light stain, you can skip straight to sanding.",
        "For thick layers of paint or stain, though, a chemical stripper is a sensible first step, so long as you follow all product instructions and safety precautions\u2014including providing adequate ventilation.",
        "Chemical strippers are usually applied to the surface with a brush, then scraped off with a putty knife after a designated waiting period.",
        "Follow the specific instructions that come with your stripper.",
        "Wear chemical-resistant cleaning gloves, goggles, and a respirator when applying and removing the stripper.",
        "Wipe the stripped stairs with a clean, slightly damp rag before moving on to sanding.",
        "Sand away nicks, dents, and any remaining finishes with medium-grit sandpaper.",
        "To speed things up, use an electric random orbital sander for easily-accessible surfaces.",
        "Corners and other tight areas may require a finishing sander, sanding block, or sandpaper sheet.",
        "In the hardest-to-reach areas, a small wood chisel can help to remove the last bits of finish.",
        "Medium-grit sandpaper is in the 60-100 grit range.",
        "Follow the product instructions carefully if you\u2019re using an orbital sander.",
        "Wear thick gloves, eye protection, and a respirator.",
        "Apply even pressure and keep the sander in constant motion.",
        "When sanding by hand, use smooth, even, back-and-forth strokes.",
        "Move on to fine-grit sandpaper to finish your sanding job.",
        "If you\u2019re staining brand-new stairs, you may only need to give them this final light sanding.",
        "Use your orbital sander and/or hand sanders to give the stairs an even texture and appearance that\u2019s ready to accept stain.",
        "Fine-grit sandpaper ranges from about 120-220 grit.",
        "Apply gentle, even pressure.",
        "You want the stairs to appear smooth but have the slightest amount of surface texture to to accept the stain.",
        "Clean away the dust with a shop vacuum and tack cloths.",
        "Use the shop vacuum to suck up the bulk of the dust on the steps and surrounding vicinity.",
        "Follow up by wiping down the stairs with tack cloths, which will remove any remaining dust.",
        "As the name indicates, tack cloths are slightly sticky rags.",
        "You can buy them at any home improvement store.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a tack cloth, use slightly dampened rags.",
        "Plan to stain either all the stairs or every other stair, based on your needs.",
        "Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to close the staircase to all foot traffic for at least 2 days after completing the job.",
        "If this isn\u2019t possible, finish every other step first so that the staircase can still be (carefully) used.",
        "After at least 2 days, move on to finishing the remaining steps.",
        "In any case, always work from the top step down\u2014it\u2019s much easier and more comfortable to do the job this way!",
        "Applying Wood Conditioner Choose stain, varnish, and (if needed) wood conditioner of the same type.",
        "For example, if you choose an oil-based stain, also choose an oil-based varnish and conditioner.",
        "Or, if you prefer a water-based stain, go with a water-based varnish and conditioner.",
        "Mis-matched products will result in a rough, non-durable finish.",
        "Oil-based products provide a deeper, richer, more durable finish.",
        "Water-based products are easier to clean up and are typically considered more eco-friendly.",
        "Wood conditioner isn\u2019t absolutely essential, but is highly recommended in nearly all cases.",
        "Brush on the wood conditioner, especially with soft woods like pine.",
        "Use a natural bristle paintbrush or a rag to apply a thin coat of the conditioner over the wood.",
        "Apply it in the direction of the wood grain, wait the recommended time (usually 15 minutes), then wipe off any excess (in the direction of the grain) with a clean rags.",
        "Let the conditioner dry for at least 30 minutes but not more than 2 hours before applying stain, or as recommended on the container.",
        "Wood conditioner causes softer woods to absorb stain more slowly, resulting in a more even finish with fewer blotches and streaks.",
        "If you\u2019re not sure whether your stairs are made of a soft wood (like pine), a medium wood (like walnut), or a hardwood (like oak), go ahead and use wood conditioner.",
        "At worst, it will make no noticeable difference in the finished stain.",
        "Sand the conditioned wood lightly with fine-grit sandpaper.",
        "Just before applying the first coat of stain, lightly go over the stairs with 220-grit sandpaper to add a slight bit of roughness to the wood surface.",
        "Use tack cloths to remove the dust before proceeding.",
        "Sand in the direction of the grain, using even strokes.",
        "Adding Coats of Stain Apply the first coat of stain with a paintbrush or rag.",
        "After reading the instructions for mixing the stain, dip your brush or rag into it and apply an even layer with smooth, long strokes that go with the grain of the wood.",
        "Allow the stain to penetrate the wood for 5-15 minutes, depending on the depth of color you desire.",
        "Leaving the stain on for 15 minutes will produce a deeper, richer stain color than leaving it on for 5 minutes, but it might also conceal some of the natural beauty of the wood grain.",
        "It\u2019s really a matter of personal preference when it comes to choosing a brush or a rag\u2014either one will do a good job with the right technique.",
        "Wipe off excess stain that hasn\u2019t soaked into the wood after 5-15 minutes.",
        "Use clean, dry cloths and wipe in the direction of the grain.",
        "Do not allow any stain that has not penetrated the wood to dry on the surface.",
        "It will cause streaks and smears.",
        "Add additional coats if you want a deeper, darker finish.",
        "Allow the first coat to dry completely\u2014this typically takes about 4 hours, but check the product instructions.",
        "If you like the look, move on to sealing the stain.",
        "Or, if desired, add another coat of stain using the same process as before.",
        "You can add 3-4 total coats if you wish.",
        "Remember to keep wiping away the excess stain 5-15 minutes after application.",
        "Allow 4 hours between coats.",
        "Protecting the Stain with Varnish Brush on a coat of floor-grade polyurethane varnish.",
        "Follow the package instructions for stirring and applying the varnish.",
        "Unless otherwise directed, use a natural bristle paintbrush and apply a thin layer using long, even strokes.",
        "Stairs are high-traffic areas, so sealing them is essential.",
        "Remember to use a compatible varnish\u2014oil-based with an oil-based stain, or water-based with a water-based stain.",
        "Allow the varnish to dry for the recommended time, such as 4 hours.",
        "Sand the varnish lightly if you want to apply a second coat.",
        "One coat of varnish may be sufficient, in which case you\u2019re all done!",
        "However, since stairs take a beating from foot traffic, adding a second coat isn\u2019t a bad idea.",
        "Before doing this, very lightly sand the varnish with 220-grit sandpaper.",
        "Wipe away the dust with a tack cloth before proceeding.",
        "Some floor-grade polyurethanes do not require sanding between coats, especially if the second coat is applied within 12 hours of the first coat.",
        "Check the product instructions.",
        "Apply a second coat of varnish.",
        "Use the same process as before.",
        "When you\u2019re done, allow the finish to dry for at least 48 hours before using the stairs.",
        "After the drying time is complete, remove any drop cloths, painter's tape, and other materials, and enjoy your beautiful new staircase!"
