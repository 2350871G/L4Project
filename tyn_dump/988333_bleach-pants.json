                    "description": "Before you decide to go ahead and bleach any pair of pants in your wardrobe, take some time to consider the fabric and quality of the pants. Bleaching works best on fabrics like denim, cotton, rayon, linen and polyester. The pants should also be of fairly good quality, as bleaching can disintegrate thin or weak fabrics. Before you decide to bleach your favorite pair of jeans, it may be a good idea to test the bleaching process out with an older pair first. Good quality, second-hand jeans from a thrift store are perfect for this. Just make sure that the pants you are bleaching have no holes or tears, as the bleach can eat away at the edges and cause them to widen."

If you want them bleached evenly, you don't need to do anything, but if you want to create a tie dye effect, you will need to ball the pants up in your hands, then use two large rubber bands to hold the pants in the ball shape."

Any kind of bleach can be used; even generic brands will work just fine. Mix the solution in a large plastic tub or basin, or a sink that you will not be using for several hours. New, fresh bleach will work better than old bleach and will be more effective when mixed with warm water, rather than cold.
