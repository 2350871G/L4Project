The water locked inside frozen vegetables can add a considerable amount after it thaws. Defrosting veggies in your refrigerator will decrease the risk of bacteria contaminating your food. Use a bowl to catch the water during the thawing process. The time it takes food to thaw in your refrigerator will vary. Generally, you can expect 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of food to thaw in about 24 hours."

Bring the water to a boil on your stove, then place your steaming basket or colander in the pot so it hangs above the water. Your steaming basket or colander shouldn\u2019t hang low enough to touch the water when boiling. About 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space should be sufficient."

Lids with a small vent are preferred, as these will allow a small amount of steam to escape, preventing condensation around the lid's edges. Water that drips from the edges of ventless lids can dirty your stovetop. Clean any spillage from your stovetop right away after steaming to prevent it from turning into a hard film."

If you\u2019re unsure whether your veggies are fully cooked, stick them with a fork. If you encounter resistance or hardness, especially at the center, you need to keep steaming."

You can get a sweet and spicy taste with a light dusting of chili flakes, some drizzled honey, and a little lemon juice. Seasonings should be adjusted according to taste. To prevent over-seasoning, add seasoning to the veggies little by little and check the flavor after each addition."

Making Steamed Veggies in a Microwave Add the veggies and a half tbsp (7.4 ml) of water to a microwave safe dish. Measure out a half tbsp of water and add it to your dish, then put in the veggies. Fasten a lid on top, then put the dish into the microwave. You may want to leave a small gap in the lid or use a lid with a small vent. In some cases, steam may build up in the container and cause damage. When cooking a lot of veggies, use enough water to coat the bottom of the dish in a thin layer of water. If you want the veggies to cook quickly, thaw them first in your refrigerator over night. Heat the veggies in 1-minute increments until cooked through.

Check if the veggies are finished cooking with a fork. Poke the veggies through the middle with a fork. If you don't encounter unnatural hardness or resistance, they\u2019re ready to be removed from the microwave. Remove and serve the veggies. Most vegetables will be ready in roughly 2 to 6 minutes. Low-power or older models of microwave may take longer than others. When veggies are fork tender, remove them from the microwave and enjoy. Steaming Common  Vegetables Steam trimmed or split broccoli for 5 to 12 minutes. Stalks that have been only been trimmed will take about 8 to 12 minutes to steam.

Cabbage that\u2019s been cut into wedges and most kinds of beans will steam in 6 to 10 minutes. Lemon or lime juice work well for flavoring cabbage; garlic and salt are a great complementary flavor for beans. Choose asparagus or kale when time is of the essence.
