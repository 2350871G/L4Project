Listen to see if your phone rings or if you get a busy signal. This can help you see if the phone can receive calls but not make them. Assessing the Outdoor Connection Find the phone line cable that connects to your home. Go outside your home and look for the cables attached to your home. You\u2019ll see a thin black cable that runs from a box on the telephone pole to your home. Locate this cable so you can find your phone box.Tip: If you have a BT phone line, the test socket is typically inside the main socket.

Follow the cable to a square box on the exterior of your home. Once you locate the phone cord, follow it with your eyes to find the spot where it connects to your home. Look for a small box on the exterior of your home that has a plate screwed over it. You\u2019ll see the phone cord sticking out of the box. If your home is very old, you may not be able to open the phone line box. In that case, call the phone company to request a service call. Use a screwdriver to unscrew the lid on the box and open it. Look for the screws that hold the lid on the phone line box. Unscrew and remove the screws, then take off the plate. This gives you access to the phone lines and a jack where the external phone line connects to your internal line. Check that you\u2019re using the right type of screwdriver. The screws may be flat head or Phillips head. Locate the telephone jack where a phone cord is plugged up. Inside the box, you\u2019ll see a bunch of wires and a phone jack with a phone cord plugged into it. Do a visual inspection to find the spot where the phone cord is plugged in. This is where you\u2019ll test your phone line. Remove the cord from the jack. Squeeze the plug and pull it out of the jack. Leave the plug hanging because you\u2019ll plug it back up after you test the line. This unplugs the internal phone line from the exterior phone line.

You\u2019ll also get a busy signal if the phone was accidentally left off the hook or someone else is dialing the number at the same time you are. In some cases, you might get a fast busy signal or a busy signal after a ring if your phone number is blocked. Call the line back later to see if you can get through. Wait at least 15 minutes, then try to call again. Listen to see if you get a ring or busy signal. If it\u2019s still busy, you might try calling again in 30 minutes to an hour. It\u2019s best to try the number several times before you assume something is wrong. However, spread out your calls so that you aren\u2019t constantly dialing the number. Use another means of contact if you keep getting a busy signal. It\u2019s possible that there is a fault in the phone line if you\u2019re constantly getting a busy signal. If this is the case, send a message by email or use another phone line to contact the person you\u2019re calling. Tell them you\u2019re constantly getting a busy signal when you call them so they can address the possible issue.Tip: Consider checking your own phone line before you contact them about theirs possibly having an issue.",
