        "If you choose to protect the seedlings until they grow larger, keep the seedlings inside in a sunny area.",
        "Keep the seedling inside for about a year, until they reach 15 to 19 inches (38 to 48 cm) tall.",
        "Keep the soil damp during this time.",
        "You may need to water the soil daily if it does not stay damp.",
        "Expose the seedlings gradually to the outside.",
        "Because the seedlings have mostly or only grown indoors, slowly begin to expose them to the outside after a year.",
        "The best time to begin exposure is during early spring.",
        "Ideally, put the pot in a place with dappled sunlight.",
        "Start by putting the seedlings outside for 2 hours during the day.",
        "Then, increase the daily outside time by an hour each day.",
        "After a few days, permanently move the seedlings outside.",
        "Plant the seedlings.",
        "If the tree won\u2019t grow very large, it\u2019s okay to keep it in a pot.",
        "For most trees, it will be necessary to plant them in the ground.",
        "Find a clear location with plenty of sunlight.",
        "Dig a hole that is at least an inch deep, depending on the size of the seedlings.",
        "Plant the seedlings and cover the hole back up with soil.",
        "Plant the seedlings at least 3 feet (91 cm) apart if you are planting multiple trees.",
        "Rake the area so that it is clear before planting the seedlings.",
        "Watch the progress of your trees.",
        "Trees take years to grow, and they will continue to grow in some way or another throughout their lifespans.",
        "Watch your tree carefully while it is a sapling.",
        "Keep it watered, and protect it from animals if necessary.",
        "You can put a mesh fence around the tree to protect it."
