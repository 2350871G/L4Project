                    "description": "Attach your DSLR to a sturdy tripod so it won't move or shake. Open the aperture (f-stop) of the camera to at least f/2.8 or wider so you let in a lot of light. The aperture refers to the hole through which light enters the camera. To let more light into the camera, adjust the aperture to a wider f-stop like f/2 or f/1.4. Consider using a cable release to capture the image, especially if you're leaving the shutter open for more than 30 seconds. This will reduce the chance that you bump or shake the camera."
