                    "description": "The first step is cleaning the mattress is removing the vomit from the surface of the bed. Use a paper plate to scrape any solids off the bed, and place it in a plastic bag to discard in the trash. Before cleaning up the vomit, it's a good idea to put on rubber gloves. That will protect you from any germs. You can also use a dustpan to scrape the vomit from your bed and dump it in the toilet to dispose of it. Hose the dustpan down outside to clean it.
