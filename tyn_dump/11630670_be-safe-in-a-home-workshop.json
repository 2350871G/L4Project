Opt for clothes that fit tightly and don\u2019t get in the way of your hands. If you normally wear hanging jewelry, such as bracelets or necklaces, take them off before you start and set them away from your work surface. If you\u2019re working with metal or flames, wear clothing made from natural fibers since they\u2019re less likely to get damaged or melt."

Keep the glasses in a safe area where they won\u2019t get scratched or damaged when you aren\u2019t using them. If you\u2019re working on small pieces of material or you can\u2019t see very well, look for safety glasses that have LED lights on the sides.

If you\u2019re using in-ear plugs, roll them in your fingers before pushing them in your ears. Allow the earplugs to expand completely in your ear before starting your tools. If you want an over-ear option, look for shop earmuffs that block out noise instead. Get earplugs that have a lanyard or string holding them together so you can hang them around your neck when you aren\u2019t using them. Cup your hands over your ears after putting in earplugs and listen for a change in volume levels. If nothing changes, then you put the earplugs in properly. If you notice a difference, take the earplugs out and try readjusting them again."

If you\u2019re only working with chemicals, use disposable gloves and turn them inside out when you throw them away to avoid skin contact. If you\u2019re working with metal or welding, opt for thicker leather gloves so metal scraps are less likely to tear through them.Warning: Don\u2019t wear gloves while working with most power tools since they could get caught and snagged, which may lead to severe injuries."

Put the fire extinguisher somewhere where you can easily reach it in case of an emergency. If there is a fire, stand at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from the flame and aim the hose at the source. Pull out the safety pin and pull the trigger to spray the extinguisher. If you need to use the fire extinguisher, make sure you replace it or have it refilled as soon as possible. Always leave the area and call your local fire department if you aren\u2019t able to control the flames.

Lay the cord flat on the floor so it doesn\u2019t have any tangles or snags, and plug it into your wall outlet. Place duct tape over the entire length of the cord that crosses through areas with foot traffic so your foot doesn\u2019t get caught. Look for solid extension cord covers that you feed the cable through at hardware stores if you don\u2019t want to put tape on your floor.Warning: Don\u2019t plug multiple extension cords into one another since they could short and create sparks. Store chemicals in cabinets or shelves away from your tools. Inspect the chemicals you have in your workshop and make note of any safety or storage information on the label. Put anything that\u2019s labeled \u201ctoxic\u201d inside of a cabinet raised off the ground so children can\u2019t access them. Make sure the lids or caps are tightly secured so fumes don\u2019t build up inside of your workshop. If the chemicals say that they\u2019re flammable or combustible, keep them away from power tools on a metal shelf so they\u2019re less likely to ignite. Avoid using chemicals that have bleach or hydrofluoric acid since they can be toxic and interact with other chemical fumes. Don\u2019t keep chemicals next to power tools, open flames, or heaters since this can cause them to combust. Ventilate your workshop to prevent buildup of harmful fumes. If you already have a central air system in your home, keep the vents open so fumes can filter out and fresh air comes into the room. If you have a window or exterior door in your workshop, open it while you\u2019re working so fumes from tools and chemicals can escape. Put a box fan or a filtered air cleaner so it blows out of your workshop and absorbs the chemicals to keep the area safe. If you start feeling dizzy, light-headed, or sick while working, leave your shop immediately. Keep the door locked or closed while working so others don\u2019t come in. Don\u2019t let people who don\u2019t know how to use your tools into your workshop since they\u2019re more likely to get injured. Always leave the main door closed and lock it if possible so no one comes in and surprises you when you\u2019re working on a project. When you leave your workshop, keep the door locked so children or inexperienced people don\u2019t go inside and get hurt. Make sure someone knows you\u2019re in the workshop in case there\u2019s an emergency.",
