If you place it in the oven while it's still cold, the cooking time will be thrown off, and the meat could come out either undercooked or tough. A note about your meat: make sure you get rump roast, round roast, or sirloin - one of the cheaper cuts. Using the slow roasting method for prime cuts of beef doesn't work as well, since prime cuts are more tender. If you want to cook a prime cut of beef, see  How to Cook a Prime Rib Roast. Make sure the beef you get is boneless, and check for a dark pink, springy surface and plenty of marbling. Depending on the cut you get, it might have a cap of fat on top."

You can either ask your butcher to truss the roast for you or do it yourself using kitchen twine. Simply cut a few lengths of twine and tie them around the beef at intervals down its length.

Seasoning all sides will ensure even cooking and flavoring in the final product when you roast red meat. Seasoning all over will also help seal in the meat's juices."
