White distilled vinegar will give you more of a brown color in your wood, apple cider vinegar will impart more of a bluish-gray, and balsamic vinegar will have more of a green tint. Depending on the wood you are using, the intensity of your vinegar weathering may vary. Differences in wood composition will influence the end result. These kinds of vinegar are generally inexpensive and can be found at most grocery stores. You don't need a fancy brand for great results, even generic kinds of vinegar should work well for weathering."

Since vinegar is a relatively thin liquid and spreads easily, 1 - 2 cups should be enough. Then place a piece of steel wool into the solution. Generally, the longer you allow your vinegar and steel wool to sit, the more intense the weathering effect will be. You may want to use a fine steel wool, like 0000 steel wool, as this will dissolve more easily in your vinegar solution and decrease the wait time. At about the 15 minute mark, your steel wool will start dissolving into the solution. This will create a lighter weathering effect. Longer wait times will produce a darker result. Adding a second piece of steel wool to the mix can speed the process along, as there will be more steel available for the vinegar to break down."

Instant coffee, however, reacts more easily to water, and will likely have the most pronounced effect. A tablespoon of grounds in your solution should be sufficient, if you wish to darken the effect of your weathering. You can modify the amount of coffee used in your solution.

When dipping, you should keep your fingers out of the solution. Use a pair of pliers, tongs, or a plastic glove to prevent skin contact.

If you're in a rush and can't wait for your wood to air dry, you can use a hair dryer to speed up this process.

If the baking soda isn't equally distributed, parts of your wood could look more weathered than others.

Generally, hardwoods have a higher tannin content than softwoods. If you notice natural yellow, red, or brown tinting in the wood, this could be a strong indication of tannins.

        "Continue this process until you achieved your desired look.",
        "Stain your wood, if desired.",
        "Staining your wood will add color, but it will also bring out the features of your weathering.",
        "Many kinds of lighter colored wood may not show much weathering until it is stained.",
        "Staining can be bought at most hardware stores, or in the home improvement section of most general retailers.",
        "Staining can dramatically change the appearance of wood, and some staining might react less favorable with your weathered wood than others.",
        "You should stain a test piece of weathered wood to prevent any unpleasant surprises.",
        "There are many different brands of wood staining you might use.",
        "For the best results, you should follow the directions on the brand you purchased.",
        "Distressing Wood with Baking Soda Collect your weathering supplies.",
        "You're going to be changing the appearance of your wood with a solution of warm water and baking soda.",
        "After the solution is mixed, you'll apply it to your wood with a paintbrush, allow it to dry, and then you can stain the wood if you desire.",
        "All things considered, for this project you'll need:\nA container (for your weathering solution)\nA paintbrush\nBaking soda\nWood\nWood staining (recommended; optional) Prepare your wood.",
        "Dirt, dust, or irregular bits of wood can make the application of your weathering solution inconsistent.",
        "Wiping down your wood with a damp, clean rag first will help prevent this from happening.",
        "You might also want to sand the wood to give it a professional, well-finished look.",
        "Mix your solution.",
        "There is no perfect proportion for this weathering solution.",
        "A high concentration of baking soda in warm water will produce a more intense weathering effect.",
        "A good starting point, however, is 1 cup of warm water and 1 tablespoon of baking soda.",
        "Mix your baking soda and water thoroughly before applying the solution.",
        "If the baking soda isn't equally distributed, parts of your wood could look more weathered than others.",
        "Baking soda has a chemical reaction with a substance in the wood known as \"tannins.\"",
        "Wood high in tannins, like mahogany, oak, and walnut, will react more intensely with this solution.",
        "Generally, hardwoods have a higher tannin content than softwoods.",
        "If you notice natural yellow, red, or brown tinting in the wood, this could be a strong indication of tannins.",
        "Since wood with a higher tannin content reacts stronger than lower tannin wood, you may want to decrease the amount of baking soda when weathering high tannin wood.",
        "Apply your solution to the wood.",
        "Take your paintbrush and dip it into your weathering solution.",
        "Use a generous coating to completely cover your wood with the solution, but do not leave excess puddling on it.",
        "Pay special attention to cracks and knots, as these can be difficult to completely coat.",
        "It's better to use less than more at this point in the weathering.",
        "If after the wood dries it is not weathered to the point you desire, you can add another layer of solution.",
        "A single coat of this solution should be enough to have a noticeable effect on your wood, though the change in woods containing few tannins may be slight.",
        "Allow the wood to dry.",
        "Since you've only applied a single coat to your wood, it shouldn't take too long for it to dry.",
        "In most climates, 10 minutes should be enough for your wood to be ready for staining, though in humid regions this may take longer.",
        "If your wood is taking longer to dry than you'd like, you can use a hair dryer to dry it more quickly.",
        "Observe your wood closely at this point.",
        "If it is not as weathered as you wanted, you should apply another coat of your weathering solution and allow it to dry again.",
        "Add a coat of wood staining to highlight weathering.",
        "This step is optional, though adding staining to your wood will make the weathering more distinct.",
        "Use a clean brush to apply your stain in the fashion indicated by its label until the surface of the wood is completely stained.",
        "Use a test piece of wood that you've already weathered to prevent unpleasant surprises.",
        "Some stains may have a unexpected effect on your weathered wood.",
        "Adding Character with Manual Techniques Scour the wood with a stiff wire brush.",
        "The weathered look is caused by wood breaking down over time, and you can simulate this wear by using a wire bristle brush on your wood.",
        "However, this process can take a great deal of time and effort before you achieve the right effect.",
        "The stiffer the bristles of your brush, the more it will break down the wood as you scrub.",
        "Use strong, firm pressure for the best results.",
        "Depending on the kind of wood you are using, this process might take a day or more of hard scrubbing before the effects are apparent.",
        "Erode the wood with rocks.",
        "Rocks, stones, and other airborne particles naturally wear wood down over time.",
        "You can do the same by adding small, irregularly shaped rocks and pebbles to the surface of your wood and scrubbing it with your wire brush or stepping on the stones to scrape the stones against wood.",
        "The key to this technique is trapping the stones between your brush or foot before applying pressure.",
        "As the rocks rub against or are ground into the wood, it will break down and look more weathered.",
        "Exercise care when trying to grind stones into your wood with your feet.",
        "You can very easily lose balance and injure yourself.",
        "You may be able to erode a larger area of your wood at a time by sandwiching rocks between two boards and standing on the top board.",
        "Use a tool to etch the wood.",
        "This technique allows for the most intentional weathering.",
        "With a tool, like a woodworking knife, a screwdriver, or a chisel, you can add notches and small cuts to give more character to the wood.",
        "However, the cuts you make may appear unnatural.",
        "In this case:\nUse sandpaper to soften the sharp edges of your cuts to make them look more natural.",
        "Hardwoods may require a coarser grain of sandpaper for you to sand effectively.",
        "Use your wire bristle brush to make your tool weathering appear less intentional.",
        "Even a few passes with your brush can have a significant effect."
