Work any tangles or knots out of your hair with a wide-tooth comb while in the shower. It's easiest to do this while the conditioner is still on your hair."

Then, apply pressure to squeeze out any excess water. Repeat until you\u2019ve finished all of the sections. You can also use a cotton T-shirt to wring out the excess water from your hair. Many people find that the thinner cloth helps to create better waves and reduces frizz. If you have already curly hair, a t-shirt will also prevent the curl from breaking down. Using a microfiber towel works in the same way as using a t-shirt. To give your hair even more texture, you can use a towel to wrap it up on your head like a turban right after stepping out of the shower. Keep it up like this for 2 minutes.

Depending on how fast your hair dries, you may need to leave the clips in longer than 30 minutes. Try to use a hairspray that makes your hair feel soft after it\u2019s applied.

Whatever you do, do not brush your hair out with a hairbrush or comb. This will undo the curls and cause your hair to look frizzy.
