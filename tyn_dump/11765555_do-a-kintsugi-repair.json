The fewer pieces that break off of the object, the better. If the ceramic or porcelain item shattered into dozens of pieces, you cannot do a kintsugi repair.

        "You can use a paintbrush if you prefer, but you won\u2019t be able to clean it after you\u2019re done, so you may go through a lot of brushes if you\u2019re repairing a lot of cracks.",
        "You will need a new cotton swab or mixing stick for every individual crack that you repair.",
        "Attaching Your Cracked Pieces Apply the epoxy solution to the crack on the largest broken piece.",
        "Start with your biggest crack.",
        "Pick your first piece up and gently dab the epoxy solution into the exposed crack with your cotton swab or mixing stick.",
        "You do not need a lot epoxy, so gently drag the edge of your swab or stick across the surface to apply a thin layer of the epoxy.",
        "Either cover the cracked surface entirely in a thin layer, or add smaller, thicker lengths of epoxy along the center of the seam that you\u2019re gluing.",
        "Reload the swab or mixing stick whenever it looks like there isn\u2019t any epoxy coming off of the tip.",
        "When you press the 2 pieces together, any thick globs of epoxy are just going to squeeze past the sides anyway, so there\u2019s no real benefit to using a lot of the epoxy.",
        "If you\u2019re using a thin layer of epoxy, spread the material over the exposed surface entirely.",
        "You can also simply load the middle of the seam up with a thicker layer of epoxy and let it spread naturally when you squeeze the pieces together.",
        "If you have a ton of epoxy left over, it\u2019s a sign that you should mix less of it the next time you do this!",
        "Squeeze the first 2 pieces together for 2-3 minutes to let them dry.",
        "Put the mixing stick down and pick up the piece that you\u2019re attaching in your dominant hand.",
        "Hold the piece with epoxy on it in your nondominant hand.",
        "Carefully line the 2 pieces up at the cracked edges.",
        "Gently squeeze the pieces together and make any minor adjustments immediately to line the pieces up perfectly.",
        "Hold the pieces together by applying light pressure for 2-3 minutes to give the epoxy time to bind.While the epoxy mixture will take 12-24 hours to cure, the 2 pieces will stick together after a few minutes.",
        "Scrape the excess epoxy solution off with a razor blade.",
        "Set your glued piece down on the towel.",
        "Immediately grab a flat razor blade or small utility knife.",
        "Drag the blade gently over the surface of the seam you\u2019ve just glued to scrape up any excess epoxy that\u2019s sticking out past the surface of the porcelain or ceramic.",
        "This can be kind of tricky to do for round surfaces, so take your time and work in small sections to remove the excess epoxy.The faster you can do this, the better.",
        "The epoxy becomes harder to scrape off after 10 minutes or so and it will have already been 3-5 minutes at this point.",
        "Wipe any particularly large globs of epoxy off with a dry towel.",
        "On a good kintsugi repair job, none of the epoxy and mica powder should be sticking out past the surface of the crack.",
        "The object should look like there are gold or silver veins running along the surface of the material.",
        "Some people like the look of the excess epoxy, though!",
        "Wait 12-24 hours for the epoxy to cure.",
        "The epoxy starts drying pretty quickly, but it typically takes 12-24 hours to completely dry.",
        "Attaching each broken piece requires a fair bit of pressure, so you have to wait for the first 2 pieces to dry entirely before you add any additional pieces.Tip: Read the label on your 2-part epoxy to see how long it takes to dry completely.",
        "Some epoxies take as little as 6 hours to cure, while others require 36 hours to air dry.",
        "Most epoxies need 12-24 hours of drying time, though.",
        "If you don\u2019t give the 2 pieces time to cure, the entire repair job may shatter in your hands when you apply pressure to the next piece you\u2019re adding.",
        "Continue this process until you have finished adding all of the broken pieces.",
        "Once your first 2 pieces are dry, repeat this entire process again.",
        "Mix more epoxy with a small amount of mica powder in a new plastic cup or tray.",
        "Apply the epoxy to a new crack and add your next piece.",
        "Hold the new piece against the dried portion for 2-3 minutes and wait another 12-24 hours for the epoxy to cure.",
        "Continue doing this until you finish the entire project!",
        "Always work in a way where you\u2019re adding the piece that is adjacent to the previous section, closest to the piece you started with.",
        "If you ever have a choice (which may happen if you glue a middle piece), choose to add the piece that looks more stable.",
        "When you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have a beautiful piece of ceramic art.",
        "You won\u2019t be able to eat or drink out of it since the epoxy residue cannot be ingested, but it will make an absolutely stunning showpiece in your home!",
        "Don\u2019t worry if your repair doesn\u2019t look perfect.",
        "The entire premise of a kintsugi repair is that mistakes should be highlighted and valued!"
