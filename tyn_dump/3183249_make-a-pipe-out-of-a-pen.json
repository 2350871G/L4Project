Only use a pen with a metal tip that can be unscrewed to reduce the odds that you unnecessarily expose yourself to dangerous chemicals when you smoke.Warning: This should be a last-resort method for smoking. If you don't have a pipe, hookah, or rolling papers, see if you have a piece of fruit laying around. Apples and other fruit can be used to make a safe pipe. You can use a pen with a metal tip and a plastic case, but it's better if the case is made out of metal as well.
