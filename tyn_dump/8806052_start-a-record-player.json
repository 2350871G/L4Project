Place the palm of your right hand under the opening of the sleeve. Turn the sleeve upside down and let the record slide out onto your open palm. When you see the hole in the middle of the record, put a finger inside. Then, hold the record on the sides. Be careful not to hold onto the flat surface of the record, since it will get dirty and wear out faster. Place the record on the platter of your record player.
