Take a white candle and rub it against the blade before you slice through the foam. The wax will make the blade slide smoothly in the foam. It's best to use these simple blades with soft or thin foam. If the blade begins to catch on the foam, just rub the candle on the blade again."

Select a metal cookie cutter in the shape you want to cut and press it down evenly through the foam. The cutter should cut completely through the thin foam.

Place the dental floss on your work surface and lay a sheet of foam down on the floss. Position the sheet so the floss lines up to where you want to make the cut. Hold the foam with one hand and use your other hand to pull the end of the floss towards you. Dental floss works best for straight cuts. If you want to cut through multiple sheets of foam, slice them separately to get clean cuts."

Use the thinnest blade on the knife to make straight or curved cuts. Go slowly through the foam as the electric knife cuts so you get a clean cut. If you're cutting a very soft foam, avoid pushing down while you cut with the electric knife. This can make it difficult to cut or can move the blade away from where you want to cut."

If you'd rather hold the foam and move the saw, you can remove the base on most foam saws, or use a common jigsaw for thinner foam boards."

If you'd like to cut more details (such as waves, curvy lines, or circles), consider using a hot wire foam cutting table. You'll be able to select the thickness of the blade when you buy a hot wire cutter. This will determine the size of foam that you're able to cut through."
