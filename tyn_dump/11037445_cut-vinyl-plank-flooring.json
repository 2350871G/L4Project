                    "description": "You can use a cloth measuring tape if you want, but it\u2019s easier to use a self-retracting tape measure, since they have a metal lip on the end to attach it to one end of your flooring. To do this, press the metal lip on the right angle where your vinyl plank ends and pull on your tape measure. Pull it towards the location where you want to make your cut and measure the necessary length by checking the measurements printed on the tape. You can use a foldable ruler instead of a measuring tape if you\u2019d like. Foldable rulers are good for measuring cuts because they snap into place to create a straight edge."

To use one, hold your framing square flat against the plank that you wish to cut. Press the flared base against the bottom of the plank and hold it in place by applying a little pressure. To change the location of your angle, simply slide it across the bottom of your vinyl plank. A framing square is sometimes called a carpenter square."
