If you are adding in any loose supplies, keep them contained before packing. Elementary school supply lists usually call for colored pencils, crayons, and magic markers. To save space, choose the colors you use most for each, remove them from their box, and wrap each group together with rubber bands. Middle or high school supply lists may call for post-it notes. Put the post-it notes in a small zip lock bag. This will make sure none of the notes rip off or get bent in the pencil case."

Choose a fabric that will be less likely to rip in between classes, so none of your supplies fall into your backpack or on the floor. Try to get a pencil case made with nylon fabric. Not only is it easier to clean, it is strong enough to stay intact if you fill your pencil case to maximum capacity. Hard plastic pencil cases are durable, but make sure to keep track of how much supplies you try to pack. If you pack too much, you will be less likely to close the case because it has a lid instead of a zipper."
