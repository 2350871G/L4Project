        "If you're working on difficult practice questions and you're missing half of them, it's a sign that you need to switch to slightly easier problems and work your way back to the difficult ones.",
        "Focus for realistic chunks of time.",
        "Instead of studying for hours and losing concentration, it is best to study for thirty or forty minutes at a time.",

        "Make time for refresher sessions.",
        "As you move further into your revisions schedule, you may need to remind yourself about particular subjects or topic areas that you covered weeks or months ago.",

        "Make sure you get lots of sleep before the exam day.",
        "Sleep is important for cognition, which is necessary for exam performance.",
        "To ensure a good performance, getting a solid rest is really important.",
        "For instance, you should try to get between eight and ten hours of sleep per night.",
        "Unfortunately, not getting sufficient sleep will limit your concentration and learning.",
        "If you are prioritizing study time over getting adequate sleep (i.e., 8-10 hours), it could negatively impact your ability to concentrate and learn during your study sessions."
