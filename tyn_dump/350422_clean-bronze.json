Use a bowl that is big enough to allow you to mix the two ingredients together without the flour flying everywhere. Blend these two until they are fully mixed together. Add \u00bd cup (118 ml) of salt to your mixture and stir. Your mixture should now be a paste of the vinegar, flour, and salt. Spread the paste on your bronze.

Use a soft cloth, such as a chamois leather cloth, to dry the bronze. While you are drying the bronze, rub it with the cloth to remove any marks. Make sure it is completely dry and that all the paste is removed. Rub a dab of olive oil onto the bronze. Add a few drops of olive oil to a soft clean cloth and rub it over the surface of your bronze. Olive oil has been a method for cleaning and protecting bronze since ancient times. Using Boiling Water and Soap Place your item in a pot of boiling water on your stove. Choose a pot that is big enough to hold your entire bronze item. Bring the water to a boil first, and then place your bronze inside the pot. Leave it in the pot for a moment or two, until it is hot. If your item is too large to fit in a pot of boiling water, consider using a different method to clean it. Remove the item from the pot carefully. Use tongs to grab the item from the hot water, or use a strainer to drain the water. Place the strainer in the sink, and carefully pour the water from the pot into the strainer. If your bronze item is delicate, be careful not to let it fall too far into the strainer. Dip a flannel cloth in water and soap. The flannel cloth should be soapy and full of suds. Use it to pick up the warm bronze item, and then rub the item thoroughly with the cloth. Remove any marks or stains with gentle rubbing. Use a natural, unscented soap. Avoid using alkaline soaps that don't have sodium hydroxide as an ingredient.

Be careful not to burn yourself if the bronze is still very hot. You can use the cloth as a barrier between your skin and the bronze. Dry the bronze with chamois leather or a shammy. Chamois leather is sheep or lambskin leather that is tanned using natural oils. It is known for being absorbent and non-abrasive, so it will not damage your bronze as you dry it. Using Household Items Cover your item with ketchup. Using a sponge, your hand (in a glove, if you want to avoid a mess), or simply a bowl full of ketchup, apply ketchup to the entire surface of your bronze. Let it stay covered in ketchup for about 15 minutes. Rinse it with warm water, and then dry it with a soft cloth. Apply lemon juice to your bronze item. You can squirt lemon juice onto it, or soak the item in lemon juice for 15-20 minutes. Remove the item, rinse it with warm water, and then dry it thoroughly with a soft cloth.
