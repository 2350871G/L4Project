It's much easier to learn on a properly maintained instrument that's new, instead of one that's been sitting in the attic gathering mildew. It's also a lot cheaper than buying a new model. If you're a beginner, a plastic clarinet is recommended. A Buffet B12 or Yamaha 255 are both popular models, but stick to a plastic first instrument as wood clarinets can be more difficult to play and maintain. It's usually common to use a soft reed; 2 to 2 and a half will most often work. You can use higher strength reeds (like a 3 or 4) once you have been playing for a while. Avoid no-name clarinets (clarinets from manufacturers that aren't very common). Professional clarinets players and repairers tend not to have good things to say about clarinet brands they haven't heard of. If you have an old clarinet you want to use, take it into a music shop to get it fixed up. The pads will likely need to be changed, to make sure you get a clear tone from the horn."

When it's time to take it out and put it together, inspect the case to make sure you've got all the parts ready to go in good working order. The pieces are assembled from bottom to top, in the following order:\nThe bell is the bottom component of the horn, and it fans out like a megaphone. The bottom stack makes up the main body of the clarinet, and it will have a cork connection piece on only one end of the section. The top stack makes up the other major section of the main body of the clarinet, and will have cork on both ends of the section. Line up the straight metal hinge on both pieces to orient the barrel properly. The barrel should be a short piece, 3-4 inches long, and slightly more flared at one end than the other. The mouthpiece is the top-most section of the instrument, and should come with a metal or leather ligature, which is used to hold the reed in place. Line up the bottom of the mouthpiece with the long straight octave key on the instrument."

When taking the clarinet part be careful not to let the screws fall out; they are extremely hard to get back in. Over-tightening can strain the mouthpiece, so be gentle. Don't put the reed higher than the mouthpiece, which makes it extremely difficult to produce a note. The tip of the reed should fall even with the tip of the mouthpiece. The tip of the mouthpiece is very fragile. So make sure to cover it with a mouth piece guard when not in use."

The clarinet should come to your mouth, your mouth shouldn't go to the clarinet. The clarinet should be held with your right hand on the bottom stack, your thumb on the thumb-rest on the back of the stack. Your other three fingers should rest on the three corresponding keyholes. Your left hand should hold the instrument on the top stack. Your thumb should rest on the octave key on the back of the instrument. Your other three fingers will rest on the three main keys on the bottom of the top stack. When your fingers are not in use, keep them very close to the holes to make it easier for them to get to the keys when they are needed.

You can clean the instrument fairly quickly and easily. Most horns should come with a cleaning rag, which you can draw through the body of the horn after each use. One end should have a string attached, which you use to pull through each section of the horn. It only takes a minute, but helps to keep your horn in good working order. Every now and then, it's also good to use a Q-TIp to clean around the connection points, where little particles and saliva can accumulate. Grease your corks regularly. It can make it hard to put together and take apart your clarinet if you let the corks dry up. Once you play your clarinet a lot you can grease the corks about once a week. If you grease the corks too much they may slide off."
