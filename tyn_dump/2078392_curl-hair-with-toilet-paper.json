A thicker, more durable toilet paper will make it easier to curl and tie the toilet paper into your hair without the risk of tearing or ripping of the toilet paper. You can also use paper towels or paper napkins if you do not have access to toilet paper. You will need to tear the paper towels or napkins into thin strips, about as wide as a piece of toilet paper.

Parting your hair into even sections will make it easier to curl and tie your hair with the toilet paper. If you do not have access to a comb with a long thin handle, you can use a chopstick or the tip side of a paintbrush to part and section off your hair.

You may not need a spray bottle of water if you plan on curling your hair once you have dried your hair so it is damp but not soaking wet.
