        "If you\u2019re writing descriptive copy about your travel destination or you just want to make sure you remember all the little things about your trip, carry a pen, notebook, and camera with you and take detailed notes on the things you see throughout your day that you want to write about later.",
        "Take pictures of these things to give yourself visual notes to work from.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to carry a pen and notebook around, you can also use the Notes app in your smartphone to take notes during your travels.",
        "You can most likely also take pictures with your phone.",
        "Journal every night before you go to bed.",
