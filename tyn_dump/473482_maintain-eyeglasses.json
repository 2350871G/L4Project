Any particles, scratches, or tiny hairline fissures will make it harder for you to see perfectly through your glasses, especially at night or in darkened rooms (light will travel along those scratches, creating halos and prisms). If you aren't putting them in a case, at least make sure the lenses are up, away from any surfaces."
