        "Positioning the New Window Set the replacement window into the frame opening.",
        "Set the bottom of the window in first and lift the rest of the window up into place.",
        "To secure the window, butt the exterior window frame up against the opening blind stops.",
        "Do this from the interior wall side, and take care not to push the window clear out the other side of the wall.",
        "Make sure that the sashes are still locked when you set the window in place.",
        "Use a level tool to ensure that the window is level.",
        "The replacement window may not sit flat in the window hole as once you\u2019ve set it in place.",
        "To determine if it\u2019s level, set a level on the top of the lower sash and look to see if the indicator bubble floats to the center of the tube.",
        "Even if the window looks level, it may be off-kilter to a very slight degree.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a level, purchase one at a local hardware store.",
        "The tool resembles a metal bar that\u2019s roughly 18 inches (46 cm) long.",
        "Insert shims beneath the window until it sits flat and opens smoothly.",
        "Shims are nearly flat pieces of wood that slightly raise the level of one side of the window.",
        "If the installed window doesn\u2019t cleanly open and close or if it\u2019s not level, place 1 shim at a time beneath the low side to raise it up.",
        "To secure the frame, also place shims at the middle of the frame and at the middle of the top and bottom sashes.",
        "Once the shims are in place and the window is square and opens and closes smoothly, snap off the shim stems.",
        "Install shims behind screw holes.",
        "This will prevent the frame from becoming warped when you tighten the screws through the window and into the frame.",
        "Place shims directly behind the jamb where each screw will be inserted.",
        "When you insert the screws, they\u2019ll pass directly through the shims.",
        "If the ends of the shims stick out once you\u2019ve screwed the window into place, snap them off.",
        "Securing the Window in Place Use screws to secure the window to the opening in your wall.",
        "Most replacement vinyl windows are screwed in place.",
        "Take your replacement screws and install them through the screw holes in the window sashing.",
        "Align the screws with the pre-existing holes in the wooden window frame.",
        "Tighten the screws with a screwdriver until they\u2019re firmly in place.",
        "The replacement window should have come with screws for installation when you purchased it.",
        "So, you won\u2019t need to purchase these screws separately.",
        "Install insulation around the window between the frame and opening.",
        "Use low-pressure expanding foam made from polyurethane.",
        "Shake the can and attach the narrow tube as directed.",
        "Stick the point of the tube in the gaps around your installed window, and squeeze the trigger until the gap is filled with foam.",
        "Be careful if you\u2019re using traditional expanding foam for the insulation, as installing too much insulation on top and bottom may cause window to bow.",
        "Insulation will block drafts and keep the window from letting hot or cold air you\u2019re your home.",
        "Reinstall the stops, trim, and molding that you removed earlier.",
        "Depending on the style of replacement vinyl windows that you purchased, these items may need to be screwed into place, or they may be held in place by pressure.",
        "If they need to be screwed in place, the screws will be included in the replacement window packaging.",
        "Work gently with the stops, since they\u2019re relatively delicate and can break easily.",
        "Stain or paint the interior surfaces of the window sash and frame.",
        "The exterior surface of replacement vinyl windows will already be finished.",
        "So, choose a color of stain or paint that you like and apply it to the exposed surfaces of the sash and frame.",
        "Wait 8-10 hours for the paint to dry.",
        "If the first layer of stain or paint is too translucent for your tastes, apply a second layer."
