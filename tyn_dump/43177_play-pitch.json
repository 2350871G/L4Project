Typically, a traditional game is played with partners. So, four players are ideal for this game. The dealer shuffles and then deals out six cards to each player. The dealer should hand out the cards in the pattern of 1, then 2, then 3 cards per deal. Evaluate your cards. Once the cards have been dealt, look at the cards you\u2019ve been given.
