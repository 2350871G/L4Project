        "Trace the hole with a marker on the wax paper.",
        "Use a permanent marker to trace the outline of the hole by looking at it through the paper itself.",
        "The outline does not have to be perfect but should approximate the size and shape of the hole.",
        "Press the paper against the body of the car with your non-dominant hand as you trace to help you to see the hole better.",
        "Mix the fibreglass filler mixture with the hardener with a dowel.",
        "Squeeze out or pour some fibreglass filler onto a paper plate or piece of cardboard, then add hardener and mix the two together with a wooden dowel or tongue depressor.",
        "Different brands of fibreglass patch material utilize different chemical concentrations, so make sure to read the instructions carefully to know how much have the hardener to add to the filler.",
        "Mix the filler and hardener quickly and thoroughly.",
        "You only have about 5 minutes to apply the mixture once you make it.",
        "The filler and hardener are usually different colours, so it\u2019s easy to tell if they still need to be mixed.",
        "Keep mixing the ingredients until the mixture becomes one solid colour.",
        "Lay the wax paper on the table so you can see the traced hole.",
        "Place the paper down in front of you with the traced hole facing up.",
        "You\u2019ll need to be able to see the size and shape of the hole as you add the mixture to the paper.",
        "It doesn\u2019t matter which side of the wax paper you used to trace the hole (shiny or flat side) just as long as you can clearly see its dimensions.",
        "Dab the mixture onto the drawn hole on the wax paper.",
        "Keep stirring the mixture as you scoop it up with your wooden dowel and apply it to the wax paper liberally in the centre of the hole you traced.",
        "Spread it around so it fills the entire circle you drew.",
        "Keep stirring the mixture and adding it to the wax paper so it creates an even patch out of the fibreglass.",
        "Keep adding the mixture until it extends .5 inches (1.3 cm) beyond the hole.",
        "That extra area will allow the patch to bond to the metal you exposed with the wire brush that surrounded the hole.",
        "It doesn\u2019t have to be exact, just make sure the patch extends beyond the outer perimeter of the hole all the way around.",
        "Keep adding the mixture until the patch itself is about .25 inches (0.64 cm) thick and mostly even.",
        "Remember to move quickly because the mixture is already starting to dry.",
        "Applying the Mixture to the Vehicle Use the dowel to apply the mixture directly to the edges of the hole.",
        "This will give your patch a better chance at adhering to the car\u2019s body.",
        "Apply the fibreglass mixture lightly around the edges of the hole by scooping it up with the dowel and then running the dowel along the edge.",
        "It doesn\u2019t need to be much.",
        "Just add a thin layer of the fibreglass mixture to help your patch stick.",
        "Pick up the wax paper with the mixture facing outward.",
        "Pinch the edges of the wax paper with the thumbs and index fingers on both hands and hold it up in the air so the mixture is facing the car and away from you.",
        "It may help to reposition your hands so one is pinching a top corner and one is pinching a bottom one.",
        "Be careful not to let the paper fold so the mixture comes into contact with itself or you\u2019ll have to start over.",
        "Press the mixture directly into the hole so it\u2019s flat against the vehicle.",
        "Pull the corners tight so the patch is flat as you first apply it to the vehicle.",
        "Then press the palm of your hand firmly over the patch to adhere it to the vehicle.",
        "Press the patch into the hole firmly.",
        "Then use your fingers to make sure it\u2019s attached to the metal all the way around the hole.",
        "Use your fingers to flatten and smooth the patch against the area of the car so it follows the contour lines of the vehicle.",
        "Wait an hour for the mixture to dry.",
        "These fibreglass mixtures dry very quickly.",
        "On small holes, it may only take a few minutes for the mixture to dry enough to work with.",
        "However, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.",
        "Give the patch plenty of time to dry before attempting to do any more work on it.",
        "The patch will dry faster with good airflow.",
        "Open the garage door if you\u2019re working indoors and the weather permits.",
        "Sanding and Finishing the Fiberglass Peel the wax paper away from the vehicle.",
        "Pinch one corner of the wax paper with your thumb and index finger, then peel it away from the patch slowly.",
        "If the patch appears to be disrupted by you pulling on the wax paper, it\u2019s not dry yet.",
        "Give it another hour, then attempt to peel it off again.",
        "Otherwise, remove the wax paper completely.",
        "The fibreglass patch will stay in place with the wax paper gone.",
        "The patch is now secured onto the vehicle.",
        "Sand any imperfections out with 220-grit sandpaper and water.",
        "If there are any imperfections in the patch, you can remove them by pouring water over it as you sand it with 220-grit sandpaper.",
        "Keep pouring water over the patch as you sand it until the fibreglass is as smooth as you want it.",
        "Be careful not to press too hard into the middle of the patch as you sand or you may break through it.",
        "If you accidentally sand too much away, you can mix more fibreglass and add it to the patch, let it dry, and start sanding again.",
        "Add a spray-on primer to prevent further rust.",
        "Once the fibreglass patch has a nice, even finish, apply an even coat of automotive primer from a spray can.",
        "Shake the can well, then hold it about 12 inches (30 cm) away and swipe the can from left to right as you spray it.",
        "Be sure to cover the patch and any exposed metal.",
        "Let the primer dry overnight before doing any more work to it.",
        "At this point, the hole is repaired and won\u2019t start rusting again.",
        "Paint the repair if you desire a professional finish.",
        "You can purchase automotive paint matched exactly to your vehicle by contacting the dealership and giving them your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).",
        "While painting a car is a difficult and complex process, applying a layer of matched touch up paint to small repairs can make them pretty inconspicuous.",
        "Simply spray it on the same way you did the primer.",
        "Hold the can about 12 inches (30 cm) away from the area you\u2019re painting and swipe it from left to right as you spray.",
        "For larger repairs, you should treat and paint the entire panel of the car if you want it to blend with the rest of the vehicle perfectly.",
        "That may be a job for a certified body shop if you don\u2019t have the tools and expertise required."
