Heart felt sincere prayers like \"My heart says of you 'seek his face!' Your face Lord I will seek\" (Psalm 27:8) are what God stokes on. God loves it when we worship him in devoted prayer. It's an awesome way to start the day because you find God's Holy  Spirit fills you and you can't help but let your light shine to the rest of the world! (Aka the people around you.)"
