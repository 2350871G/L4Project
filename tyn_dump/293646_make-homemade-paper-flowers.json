You can put your flowers in a bean-filled pot if you want to make them look more realistic and complete. You can also turn them into a bouquet by building a handle from rolled paper. Crepe Paper Remembrance Poppies Prepare your paper. Get red crepe, wax, or glassine paper and cut it into circles at the size you want your poppies to be. Once you have the circles, form the petals by cutting rounded indents at three points just a short way into the paper. You will need 2 circles per flower that you want to make. Get the petal look. Press your finger into the center of the circles and pull the edges of the circle up around in until you have a cup-like shape. Squeeze, roll, and generally further create wrinkles that start at the base and move toward the edge of the petals. Flatten the circles back out when you feel it is wrinkled enough. Cut your petals. Cut from the rounded indents that you made until about two thirds of the way into the circle. Glue the petals together. Put a dot of glue at the center of one circle and attach it to another circle, staggering the petals to make the flower look more real and full. Create the centers. Using small squares or circles of green and black tissue paper, do a similar wrinkling process to create the center of the flower. Attach the centers. Place the black tissue center on top of the green tissue center and glue them together in that way. Then, glue them at the center of the flower. Add your pollen. Using white out or white paint, dab dots of white onto the tips of the black paper to complete the poppy look. Coffee Filter Roses Fold the coffee filter into eighths. Fold a round, paper coffee filter into eighths by folding it in half 3 times. Fold 7 filters in this way. Fold a few coffee filters differently. You'll also want to fold 2 coffee filters a bit differently. Fold these in half twice but then, instead of doing that again, do the final fold into thirds. Shape the petals. Using scissors, cut the eighths triangles so that the top, wide end becomes rounded. This forms your basic petal shape. Cut one and then use it as a pattern to cut the rest. When they're done, unfold them into semi circles and cut the semicircle in half. Set aside the petals that were folded into thirds at the end, as these will form the center of your rose. Start the bud. Starting with the petals that were folded into thirds, take one set at a time and fold up the bottom point. Glue from this folded up point to whatever you decide to use as a stem, wrapping it around the stem.

Keep adding petals until your rose looks full. Add finishing touches. When the rose is done, you might want to add a few finishing touches.
