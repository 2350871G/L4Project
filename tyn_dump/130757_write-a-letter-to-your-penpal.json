        "Close your letter with a question.",
        "Instead of just saying goodbye and leaving it at that, ask a question in addition to your goodbye.",
        "This give them something to answer in their next letter.",
        "Rather than asking a random question, however, ask something that relates back to the topic of your letter.",
        "For example, if you wrote about how excited you are for summer, you might ask, \u201cHow about you?",
        "Do you like swimming, too?",
        "Hope to hear from you soon!\u201d\nAt the very end, skip 2 lines, then write \u201cSincerely,\u201d \u201cTake it easy,\u201d or \u201cUntil next time.\u201d Sign your name right under that.",

        "Building Your Relationship With Your Pen Pal Decide how committed you are to your pen pal.",

        "Depending on your interests and purpose in writing to a pen pal, you will make different choices about who you opt to connect with.",
        "For instance, if you're interested in learning German, you should connect with a pen pal from Germany, Austria, or a German speaker in another country.",
        "If you're interested in learning more about Japan, you should identify pen pals in Japan who can share their insights into Japanese society.",
        "Think about your own interests and background.",

        "Try to write to someone who is about your age and has similar interests.",
        "Find pen pals who you think are interesting and can connect with.",
        "For instance, if you're a 17-year-old punk rocker, you'll be unlikely to connect with a 45-year-old businessman.",

        "This can help you find a pen pal easier.",
        "Don't be afraid to write with someone different than you.",
        "For example, instead of finding another 17-year-old punk rocker, you could find a 16-year-old ballet dancer.",
        "Use the web to find a pen pal.",
        "There are many forums and websites available which connect people to pen pals both at home and abroad.",
        "Pen Pal World, Penpals Now, and Letter Writers Alliance are just some of the many sites which facilitate letter writing connections.",
        "Some services require fees while others are free.",
        "Both can provide good pen pals, but check before you get too excited about the sign-up process."
