Pat the melon dry with a clean towel. Cut the melon in half. Use a sharp knife to trim the stalks off at either end. Next, slice the melon in half lengthwise to split it. If you like, you can also use your knife to scrape off the outer peel on the melons. The outer skin is edible, but scraping some of it off helps lessen its roughness. Remove the seeds.

The seed and core are actually edible, so you can cook them along with the rest of the melon. However, the texture can be a little tough and chewy, and the pith is usually unpalatably bitter. Place the halves face down and slice the melon thinly. Once you\u2019ve removed the seeds, flip the halves of the melon over. Use your knife to cut the melon into slices width-wise. The slices should be approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Soak the melon in cold water for several hours to reduce the bitterness. Place the sliced melon in a large bowl, and cover it with cold water. Allow the melon to soak for 1 to 3 hours, changing the water every hour to remove as much of the bitterness as possible. Blanch the melon to tone down the bitterness. Another way to tone down the bitterness in a bitter melon is to blanch it before using it in a recipe.

Making Simple Stir-Fried Bitter Melon Heat a wok. Place a wok on the stove, and turn the heat up to high. Allow the wok to heat for about 5 minutes. If you don\u2019t have a wok, substitute a wide pan with slanted sides. Add the oil to the wok. Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of peanut oil into the hot wok. Let the oil heat for 1 to 2 minutes. You can substitute vegetable oil for the peanut oil if you prefer. Mix in the bitter melon slices and stir-fry for 5 seconds. Once the oil is hot, add 2 to 3 bitter melons that have been sliced to the wok. Allow the slices to cook briefly, stirring continuously. Stir in the salt and sugar and stir-fry for another couple of minutes.

Allow the mixture to cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continuously. You can adjust the amount of salt and sugar based on your preference. Transfer the melon to a serving dish and enjoy. When the melon is finished cooking, carefully pour the mixture onto a serving plate. Serve the stir-fried melon while it\u2019s still warm. Stir-Frying Bitter Melon with Eggs Combine the eggs, soy sauce, and pepper. Add 2 eggs, 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of light soy sauce, and a dash of ground white pepper to a bowl. Beat the mixture with a spoon until all of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Heat a wok. Place a wok on the stove, and turn the heat up to high. Allow it to heat until the wok begins to smoke, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Any large skillet with slanted sides can be substituted for the wok. Add the oil and allow it to heat. When the wok is hot, pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of peanut oil into it. Let the oil heat for 10 to 15 seconds. You can use vegetable oil in place of the peanut oil if you prefer. Mix in the bitter melon and stir-fry for a minute. Once the oil is warmed, add 1 bitter melon that\u2019s been cleaned and sliced to the wok.

Stir the mixture well, and allow it to cook until the melon begins to soften, which should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Be sure to stir the melon continuously as it cooks.

When the eggs have set a bit, use a spatula to turn the mixture over. Let it cook on the other side until the eggs set and turn a light brown, which should take approximately 1 to 3 minutes.

Whipping Up Bitter Melon with Onion and Spices Heat the oil in a wok. Place a wok on the stove, and add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil to the wok. Allow the oil to heat on medium for 3 to 5 minutes. Add the fennel seeds and cook for 30 seconds. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon (2 g) of fennel seeds into the wok. Stir fry the seeds briefly. Mix in the turmeric powder. Add \u00bd teaspoon (1 \u00bd g) of turmeric powder to the wok, and stir it in well. Let the mixture cook for 30 seconds to allow the flavors mix. Stir in the onions and salt and cook the mixture for 10 to 12 minutes. Add 4 small, sliced onions and some salt to taste to the wok. Allow the mixture to cook until the onions turn brown and begin to caramelize. Be sure to stir the onions continuously as they cook. Add the bitter melon. When the onions are caramelized, mix in 2 pounds (1 kg) of bitter melon that has been cleaned and sliced. You may want to add a little more salt to counter the bitterness of the melon. Cover the mixture and cook for at least 10 minutes. Place the lid on the wok, and allow the mixture to cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the melon is softened. Be sure to stir the mixture periodically to ensure that it cooks evenly. Mix in the fennel seed powder, lime juice, and sugar.

When all of the ingredients are combined, let the melon cook until all of the flavors are combined. Give it a taste, and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Transfer to a serving dish and serve. When the mixture is finished cooking, pour it into a serving dish. Enjoy the melon and onion dish while it\u2019s still hot. The dish is often served with rice or roti.",
