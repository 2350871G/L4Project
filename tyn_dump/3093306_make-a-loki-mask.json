You'll need to know these distances:\nThe distance from your hairline to your chin\nThe distance from one ear to the other, going over your nose\nThe length and width of your eyes\nThe width of your nose\nThe height of your nose Draw the shape of the Loki mask on a piece of stiff, corrugated cardboard. The mask's shape is roughly a rectangle with a rounded bottom, with places for eyeholes and a mouth hole. You can find a reference picture of the mask online to guide you. You'll also need to mark out a hole for your nose to fit into the mask. Although the mask features a nosepiece, you'll want space for your nose so you can wear the mask if you choose. Cut out the mask, eye, nose, and mouth holes. You can use scissors or a craft knife such as an X-acto knife. Making the Nosepiece Cut three separate nosepieces from the same stiff cardboard as the faceplate. Again, use a reference picture to guide you. The nosepieces should roughly resemble elongated hourglasses, with the nose-end lobe longer than the forehead lobe. You're cutting three pieces so that you can layer them over your nose. If you have a particularly long nose, you may want to cut four or five. Cut nose holes in all the nosepieces except the one that will go on top. This will give your nose \"breathing room\" when you don the mask. Although you can cut square holes to fit your nose, you may want to cut the nose holes to the end of the nose lobe to expose your nostrils if you plan to wear the mask for extended periods. Cut a circle at the top of the forehead lobe of the nosepiece that will go on the outside. This is where you'll put the \"L\" that identifies the mask as the Mask of Loki. Affix the nosepieces to the faceplate. You may want to temporarily tape each nosepiece in place as your adjust their positions and refine your nose holes, then glue them in place when you're satisfied with their arrangement. Create the nose rivets. You can create the four nose rivets in one of several ways:\nCut out cardboard circles. Use the plastic or metal heads off thumbtacks. (Do not use the entire tack.) Use actual light rivet heads. Attach the rivets to the uppermost nosepiece. Use the reference picture as your guide to place them correctly. Cut out the \"L\" symbol from cardboard. The \"L\" should be slightly italicized, without serifs, and of a size appropriate to fit within the circle. Again, consult the reference picture. Affix the \"L\" inside its circle on the nosepiece.  Texturing the Mask Cover the mask with papier mache. You can use layers of newsprint as the base on the faceplate, with paper towel or toilet tissue on top. Paper towel is suggested for the faceplate, with toilet tissue for the nosepiece. Avoid putting newsprint on the nosepiece, so that its details show up better. Bend the mask gently while the papier mache is wet. You want to create a gentle curve that matches your face, not a severe curve. You may need to tape the back side of the mask to the surface it's drying on to prevent it from straightening as the papier mache dries. Let the papier mache dry completely before painting.  Painting the Mask Paint the outside faceplate with a wash of green paint, with streaks of brown.  Paint the inside faceplate black, with streaks of green, if desired. If you plan to have the Loki mask primarily as a wall decoration, painting the inside faceplate isn't necessary, although it will protect the mask from water damage. Paint the nosepiece brown, with a bronzing rub to add highlights. You'll want to have the inside of the circle dark and the area around the rivets dark so that the \"L\" and rivet heads stand out more.",
