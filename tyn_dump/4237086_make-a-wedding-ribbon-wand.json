            "description": "Choosing the length of the rod will affect everything from dowel size to ribbon length. Hardware stores carry unfinished wood dowels in 36\" or 48\" lengths. (In 2014, one 48\" poplar wood dowel at 1/4\" thickness cost $0.78 at a nationwide hardware store. This equates to six 8\" wands, four 12\" wands, or three 16\" wands.) The thickness of the rod is also important. Since long and thin equates to delicate (aka, easily breakable) but too thick does nothing for appearance or cost. Type of wood/material. The type of wood affects strength/durability but also cost. If you are using a finishing nail (much cheaper than eye hook), you'll want a softer wood dowel so you do not chance splitting the wood. If you are using a screw eye, you may want a thicker dowel or be sure to have a drill with the appropriate sized drill bit to pre-drill the holes to prevent splitting the wood. Hold a pencil or roll up a sheet of paper. A normal, unsharpened pencil is a little over 7\" in length. A standard sheet of paper is 8.5 x 11\". Assess how many dowels will be needed in order to have one for each guest. (You may want to add 10% in case you get more guests or you make a few errors.)"

If using a finishing nail or hot glue gun, the ribbon length needed will be twice the length of the dowel. (Though you can alter that as you see fit.) If using a screw eye, you will need approximately 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) longer than the wand length). Doing either 3 colors, or 3 types of ribbon seems to be the general rule/appeal. You, however, can do whatever you choose. Some people opt for different thicknesses, textures, let your creativity go wild... within your budget."
