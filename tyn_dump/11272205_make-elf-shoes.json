    "text": " Sewing with a Regular Stitch Create 2 shoe templates out of cardstock. Make 1 sole template by tracing the bottom of your foot along a piece of cardstock. To create the side shoe template, measure the length of your foot and the height of your leg up to the ankle. Once you do this, you can transfer these measurements to create patterns for the sides of your curved elf shoes. Make a fringe pattern for the edge of your shoes. Measure the circumference of your ankle to figure out the length of your fringe. Next, draw a series of connected triangles along this length. Make the length of each triangle at least 2 inches (5.1 cm). The width of the fringe strip depends on your design preference\u2014if you want a larger fringe, make it 2 inches (5.1 cm).

To cut out the fringe more efficiently, trace the pattern onto a folded, paper-sized piece of red fabric before cutting it out.

Thread your sewing needle and stitch the heels of the side shoe fabric portions together. When placed on a flat surface, the sewn pieces will look like mirror images of one another. Make sure that there\u2019s 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) of seam allowance between your stitches and the edge of the fabric. Sew the fringe onto the top portion of the shoe. Align and stitch the red fringe along the ankles of the side shoe pieces. Keep in mind that the shoe is currently facing inside out, so make sure that the fringe stitches are also facing outward.

Go online and print out several patterns for the elf shoes. If the patterns are too small for your own shoe size, use the images as a reference when making your own templates. Double check your foot length and ankle height with a tape measure before cutting out any pattern pieces. Use this template to get started: https://www.activityvillage.co.uk/elf-shoes.

Complete the shoe by attaching the top piece of fabric to the rest of the stitched shoe. Knot the end of the thread once you\u2019re done sewing this piece into place, and use the needle to tuck any spare thread into a previous stitch. If needed, you can also use pins to keep your project secure. Add any extra decorations to the shoe with hot glue. Apply small dots or short lines of hot glue to any Pom-poms or jingle bells you feel like attaching to the shoe. You can add as many or as few decorations as you want. Forming Elf Shoes from Tape Have someone put on a pair of long socks before starting. Instruct a friend or family member to put on a pair of long socks that reach around mid-calf level. Make sure that they\u2019re a pair of socks you don\u2019t want to wear again, since they\u2019ll be serving as the base of your taped elf shoes.
