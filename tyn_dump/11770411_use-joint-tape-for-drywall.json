Start at 1 end of the seam and press the joint compound into the crack between the drywall sheets. Drag your drywall knife along the entire length of the seam to smooth it out and remove excess compound until there is just a thin layer barely higher than the surface of the drywall.Tip: You can apply this same method to repairing cracks in old or damaged drywall. The concept is the same. Just apply the tape and joint compound to a crack in a drywall sheet instead of a seam between 2 sheets to make quick repairs. Make sure you don\u2019t remove all of the joint compound from the surface as you smooth it out. Joint tape needs a base layer of joint compound to adhere to the drywall. Just try to get rid of lumps and bumps in the joint compound. This method works for any seam where 2 pieces of drywall meet flat on a wall or ceiling, including butt joints and tapered joints. For the unfamiliar, butt joints are where the sides of 2 pieces of drywall butt straight up against one another. Tapered joints are where the sides of 2 pieces of drywall are thinner than the rest of the sheets, and thus create a tapered seam."

        "Position the corner bead over the joint and press it lightly into the joint compound.",
        "Check that it is centered over the joint, then use your drywall knife to smooth it out and press it all the way into the joint compound on each side.",
        "Leave the corner bead and joint compound to dry overnight.Tip: Use a corner bead that is about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) shorter than the joint and position it up from the floor.",
        "This will prevent any cracks due to structural settling or wall expansion.",
        "If there are any gaps or air pockets between the corner bead and the drywall, just lift it up and apply some more joint compound underneath it.",
        "Then, use your drywall knife to smooth it back down and squeeze out excess compound.",
        "If you need to cut a corner bead to fit, do so with a pair of metal snips.",
        "Apply a layer of joint compound to both sides of the corner bead and let it dry.",
        "Put about 2 in (5.1 cm) of joint compound on the blade of your drywall knife.",
        "Smooth it along 1 side of the paper-faced corner bead so that it covers the paper face and blends in nicely with the surrounding drywall.",
        "Repeat this for the other side to wrap up.",
        "This step is just like applying joint compound to joint tape on any other kind of seam.",
        "Aim to get it as smooth as possible by using long, even strokes.",
        "A layer of joint compound about \u20448 in (0.32 cm) thick is typically enough to cover a paper-faced corner bead and blend it in with the surrounding drywall."
