        "Grip the bolt with your ratchet and rotate it counterclockwise to disconnect the hose from the old caliper.",
        "Once you remove the old caliper you can throw it away.You may be able to recycle your old caliper at an auto repair shop.",
        "Call one ahead of time to see if they can get rid of it for you.",
        "Secure the hose onto the intake port on the new caliper.",
        "Look for a large hole right next to a small hole on top of the new caliper.",
        "Position the banjo bolt attached to the hose so the threaded part is in the large hole and the end of the elbow-shaped piece on the side is in the small hole.",
        "Screw the banjo bolt clockwise by hand to secure it in place before tightening it with your ratchet.If the hose or bolt leaked any brake fluid, wipe it clean with a shop cloth before screwing it into the caliper to prevent any corrosion from occurring.",
        "Screw the caliper bracket against the brake rotor.",
        "Position the bracket included with your caliper on the brake rotor in the same place as the old one so the bolt holes are on the backside.",
        "Feed the bolts through the holes on the bracket and hand-tighten them until you can\u2019t rotate them anymore.",
        "Use your ratchet to tighten the bracket back in place so it doesn\u2019t move or shift around.Apply an anti-seizing fluid on the bolts before screwing them in if you want to remove them easier next time you need to make repairs on your brakes.",
        "Slide the brake pads onto the front and back of the caliper bracket.",
        "You can use the same brake pads that you had before or you can buy new ones if they need to be replaced.",
        "Slide the ends of the brake pad into the slots on the top and bottom parts of the bracket until it contacts the brake rotor.",
        "Position the other brake pad on the backside of the rotor so it\u2019s secure in the caliper bracket.Make sure you install the brake pads so the padded side is against the rotor.",
        "Otherwise, you may damage your brake system.",
        "Attach the new caliper to the bracket so it fits around the brake pads.",
        "Position the caliper so the side with the piston is on the backside of the brake rotor.",
        "Set the caliper over the brake pad assembly and slide the bolts through the holes on the top and bottom.",
        "Tighten the bolts by hand until you can\u2019t spin them anymore before securing them with your ratchet.Check that the caliper doesn\u2019t move around after you secure it in place or else it could come loose when you\u2019re driving.",
        "Bleeding the Brake System Loosen the cap on the main brake cylinder under your vehicle\u2019s hood.",
        "Open your vehicle\u2019s hood and look for a plastic reservoir that\u2019s labeled \u201cBrake Fluid\u201d or \u201cMain Cylinder.\u201d Unscrew the plastic cap on top of the main cylinder so you can see the brake fluid inside.Consult the vehicle\u2019s user manual if you can\u2019t find the brake cylinder.",
        "Loosening the cap will help the brake fluid drain quicker to make bleeding your brakes easier.",
        "Connect a clear plastic hose between the bleeder valve and a bottle.",
        "Look for the metal bleeder valve on the backside of the caliper close to where the hose connects on top.",
        "Push the end of a clear plastic hose onto the end of the bleeder valve so it\u2019s airtight.",
        "Run the other end of the hose to a resealable glass bottle or jar so the fluid can drain into it.Don\u2019t use an opaque hose since you won\u2019t be able to see the air bubbles forming.",
        "Avoid using a hose that fits loosely over the bleeder valve since it could allow air in.",
        "Open the bleeder valve on the caliper until it starts leaking brake fluid.",
        "Position the end of a spanner wrench on the hex nut on the bottom of the bleeder valve and slowly rotate it counterclockwise to loosen it.",
        "After a few seconds, you will notice some brake fluid leaking out of the valve into the hose.The bleeder valve helps remove air from the caliper so your brakes work properly.",
        "Ask a helper to pump the brake pedal until you don\u2019t see bubbles in the hose.",
        "While your vehicle is parked and turned off, have a helper press down on the brake pedal multiple times to pump the air out of the caliper.",
        "Have them continue pumping the brakes until you don\u2019t see any air bubbles coming into the hose from the caliper.",
        "Tell your helper to hold the brakes down before tightening the hex nut around the valve.",
        "Air in your caliper could make your brakes feel soft and you may not get as much stopping power as you normally would.",
        "You may need to refill your cylinder with brake fluid if it runs out.",
        "Reattach the wheel to your vehicle.",
        "Once you\u2019ve bled the brakes, position your wheel back onto the bolts and push it on as far as it can go.",
        "Secure the lug nuts by hand by turning them counterclockwise.",
        "Then use your tire iron to tighten the lug nuts until you can\u2019t turn them anymore to ensure the wheel\u2019s secure.",
        "Take your vehicle for a test drive to make sure the brakes work properly.",
        "Start your vehicle, and drive it slowly down a quiet neighborhood street to test the brakes.",
        "Press on the brake pedal to make sure the caliper works properly and doesn\u2019t make any noise while you\u2019re driving.Don\u2019t drive too fast while you\u2019re testing your brakes just in case something were to go wrong."
