Undoing the knot prevents permanent creases, and it is the first step in removing existing wrinkles. First, loosen the knot by gently pulling it from side to side. Then, pull out the short and long end of the tie with your thumb. Next, use your fingers to loosen the entire knot and then gently pull it out. Removing the knot by pulling on the back end of your tie will eventually rip it."

It\u2019s usually not ideal to hang the tie on a regular hanger because it may slip off or have to be tied to stay on the hanger. If possible, drape the undone tie over a tie rack, or buy hangers especially made for ties. Make sure the tie is flat whether it has been draped or hung up. Investing in a tie rack will keep your ties in good shape for longer. You can even make your own if you are good at building things."
