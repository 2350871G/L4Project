Apply multiple coats until you reach your desired color. Inspect the color after the first coat. If you like it, great! If it looks a little off or it\u2019s not as dark as you want, repeat this process. Continue adding layers of paint until you achieve the color and look that you had in mind. In some cases, it may take up to 10 coats to achieve the right color. You don\u2019t need to seal the paint or anything. Just give the seats 24 hours to settle after the last coat before reinstalling them. Dyeing Leather Seats Use an airbrush and leather dye to paint your car seats. To paint your leather seats, buy or rent a pressurized airbrush gun. Purchase a leather dye based on the color you want to paint your seats, and pick up a primer to ensure that the paint fully adheres to the fabric. You can purchase an airbrush and leather dye paints at a custom auto supply shop or online.Warning: You need to wear a respirator while working with an airbrush gun. You can do this indoors, but open all of the windows or the door to your garage while working. You\u2019ll also need an air compressor if your airbrush gun doesn\u2019t come with one. Connect a bottle of primer to the airbrush and set it to the lowest pressure. Use a funnel to pour your primer into the airbrush\u2019s storage bottle. Once it\u2019s full, twist the bottle into the opening under the nozzle of the spray gun to secure it. Attach the air hose on the compressor to the spray gun and set the compressor to the lowest air pressure setting available. Some primers need to be thinned out with a paint thinner before you apply them. Read the instructions printed on the label of the primer to determine if you need to do this. Inspect the seams and crumpled areas on each seat. Before you spray the larger surfaces of your seat, you\u2019ll fill in the seams to ensure that the dye covers the hard-to-reach areas. Inspect the cushion to find the seams where different layers of fabric are sewn together. Identify any scrunched up or folded areas that need to be spread out as well. A good way of thinking about this is to imagine how rooms are professionally painted\u2014the 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) around the top, bottom, and corner edges are painted with a brush first before the wall is rolled. This ensures that the hard-to-reach areas are painted first. This is basically the same thing. Spray all of the seams carefully to fill in hard-to-reach areas. Set your airbrush\u2019s nozzle to the thinnest setting. Start at the top of your headrest. Pull the trigger on your airbrush gun and outline every seam where 2 layers of fabric meet. Hold the nozzle 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) away from the surface and cover each seam 3-4 times to ensure that you fill in every hard-to-reach area. Work your way down by outlining each seam you find in primer. Repeat this process for each of your seats. If there are any ripples or crumpled up portions of the fabric, spread them out with your nondominant hand and spray these areas as well. Cover the larger surfaces using a wider nozzle setting. Once all of the seams are covered, set your airbrush to the widest nozzle setting. Starting at the top, spray your seat by moving the spray gun back and forth horizontally. Cover each area 3-4 times before moving down to the next area. Continue spraying the seat until you cover every seat. You can use a bigger airbrush gun if you want to do this more quickly. A larger gun will have a wider coverage area. Repeat this process 2-3 times to reach a uniform coat. Wait 20-30 minutes for the first coat of primer to dry. Then, repeat the entire process for each seat. Outline the seams before covering the larger surfaces of each seat. Repeat this process another 1-2 times until the color of your primer is uniform and you don\u2019t see any gaps in the color. So long as the entire seat is a solid white, you can stop priming your seat. If your leather is really old and brightly colored, you may need to do this a total of 4-5 times. Wait 20-30 minutes between each coat to give the primer time to dry. Replace the airbrush bottle with your chosen dye color. Once your seats are primed, swap your airbrush\u2019s dye container with a fresh bottle filled with your chosen color. Use a funnel to pour the dye and fill your bottle up. Attach it to the bottom of the gun at the same location where you attached the primer. Keep the air compressor at the lowest pressure setting. Use the same process to cover the seams and larger areas. Apply your dye the same way that you applied your primer. Start out by using a thin nozzle setting to paint the seams and work your way down. Then, switch to a wider nozzle setting and spray back and forth in horizontal strokes until you cover the entire seat. Repeat this process for every single seat. Apply 2-3 coats of your dye until you reach a uniform color. Wait 20-30 minutes for the first coat of dye to dry. Then, apply 2-3 additional coats based on the hue and texture that you\u2019re trying to achieve, waiting between each coat. Once you\u2019ve completely covered your seats and you\u2019re happy with the uniformity of the color, you\u2019re done! Wait 24 hours before handling your seats and putting them back into your vehicle. Reassembling Your Seats Put every plastic component back where it belongs. Remove the masking tape on the plastic components that you taped over. Then, reattach every plastic handle, cover, and knob that you originally removed from each seat using the same hardware and tools that you used the first time. Reposition your front seats and reconnect the wires underneath. If you had a really complicated wire setup underneath your seats, pull up the photos that you took to reference them. Slide your seats in through you\u2019re vehicle\u2019s doors and hold them over their slots. Reinsert every wire that you removed to take the seat out and insert the wire into the corresponding terminal. Do this for both of your front seats.Warning: Double-check your wires and connections. You can short a wire or burn through your battery if you fail to properly connect your wires. Make sure that your battery is disconnected while you do this. Reattach the bolts that hold the seats in place to finish. Put each bolt back into the slot that you removed it from. Use your hex or socket wrench to tighten the 4 bolts under your front seats. Do the same for the 4-8 bolts that keep your back seats in place. Once your bolts are reattached, you\u2019re ready to take your new seats out for a drive! Keep your car out of the sun for the next 2-3 months if you can. Early exposure to the sun can cause the color of your paint job fade over time",
