If you'd like, you can sprinkle caster or superfine sugar inside the baking dish when you are done. Prepare the bread slices. Cut the crusts off of the bread first, then spread the softened butter over one side of each slice. Cut each slice twice of bread to make four triangles. Place a single layer of bread slices, buttered-side-up in the bottom of the dish. Do not overlap or squish the bread slices together. You will have lots of bread left over, which you will be using for other layers. Spread a layer of sultanas across the bread, then sprinkle them with some cinnamon. If you do not like sultanas, or can't find any, you can use another type of dried fruit, such as raisins. Repeat the bread, sultana, and cinnamon layers until you have no more slices of bread left. Make sure that you are always putting the bread down with the buttered side facing up. You last layer should be only bread\u2014no sultanas or cinnamon.

        "Stir the milk mixture often as it is coming to a boil to prevent scorching.",
        "Once the milk is boiling, take the saucepan off the heat, and turn off the stove.",
        "Beat the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until the eggs turn pale yellow.",
        "Crack the eggs open into a large mixing bowl, then add the sugar.",
        "Beat the two together with a whisk until the yolks break and blend in with the whites.",
        "This will take about 1 minute.",
        "Slowly whisk 1 cup (240 milliliters) of the boiled milk mixture into the egg mixture.",
        "Do not pour all of the milk into the eggs all at once.",
        "Pouring a little bit of the hot milk into the eggs will allow the eggs to heat up slowly without cooking.",
        "This will give you a smoother custard base in the end.",
        "Slowly whisk in the rest of the milk mixture into the egg mixture, then strain the custard base.",
        "Once you have the custard base mixed together, pour it through a fine, mesh strainer into a large mixing bowl.",
        "Discard any lumps or clumps that get caught in the strainer.",
        "Pour the custard base into the baking dish.",
        "The bread will float to the top, so use a spatula or a spoon to press down on the bread until it soaks up the custard and sinks to the bottom.",
        "Be careful not to squish or break the bread.",
        "Place the baking dish into a larger roasting pan, and fill it with about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of water.",
        "The water inside the larger roasting pan will surround the baking dish, and help the pudding cook more evenly.",
        "Bake the pudding for 60 minutes.",
        "Carefully place the roasting pan with the pudding inside it into the oven, careful not to spill any water.",
        "Bake the pudding for 30 minutes, then use a spoon or spatula to press down any bread slices that might have floated to the top.",
        "Bake it about 30 more minutes.",
        "The pudding is ready when the custard sets and puffs up; it should still be jiggle-y in the middle.",
        "Let the pudding cool on a wire rack.",
        "Once the pudding is done, take the roasting pan out of the oven, and set it down on a wire cooling rack.",
        "Let the pudding cool a little in the roasting pan.",
        "Consider making a tasty sauce for the pudding.",
        "In a small saucepan over low heat, combine 2 tablespoons (40 grams) of apricot jam with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water.",
        "Stir the two together with a fork or mini whisk until the jam turns liquid; this will take about 1 minute.",
        "Once you are done, use a pastry brush to spread the sauce over the pudding.",
        "This is not completely necessary, but it will lend the pudding more flavor.",
        "Take the pudding out of the roasting pan, and dust it with confectioner's sugar before serving it.",
        "Leave the pudding in its baking dish, and serve it while it is still warm."
