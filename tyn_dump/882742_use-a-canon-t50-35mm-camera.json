Press the silver button to unlock the dial, then hold it as you turn the dial till the line is parallel with the speed of the film. Advance the film to frame 1. Make sure the main dial is set to PROGRAM and press the shutter button; the motor drive will advance the film (if it doesn't, you're in trouble). Press it a few more times until the arrow in the frame counter window is pointing to the 1. Shooting Get out there. Get out any time the light is good (which isn't the same thing as bright daylight; early mornings and late evenings are the best). Turn the main dial to PROGRAM. This is the camera's only exposure mode, which is fully automatic. You'll only need to turn this to L to lock the shutter while it's stowed away to prevent accidental shots; keep it around your neck and you won't need to bother doing this.

You also have two useful focusing aids to ensure that your shots are sharp. One is a split image, the circle right in the center, which splits the images into two pieces, and which are aligned when the image is in focus.The other (more useful) aid is a microprism ring around the outside of the split screen. This will cause any defocus to be far more obvious than it would be otherwise; when it's out of focus, this area will flicker and display a very obvious \"cross-hatched\"-ish pattern. Turn the focus ring until either the split image is no longer visibly split, or until the image in the microprism ring is visibly sharp. Gently half-press the shutter button. This will wake the camera up and you'll see a little green P appear. Check the green P. This actually conveys some useful information: A solid, non-blinking P: green means go! The camera is happy and ready to shoot. A slowly-blinking P: If it blinks about twice a second, it's warning you that your picture might be blurred by camera shake (this happens if the shutter speed is down to 1/30 or slower). Use a tripod or brace yourself against a solid surface. If you find yourself down in this range quite a lot, you might want to consider shooting a faster film. A rapidly-blinking P: You're dead; you're either trying to operate outside the T50's metering range or you're going to need a shutter speed longer than two seconds. The T50 simply cannot operate under extreme low-light conditions, sorry. Press the shutter button all the way down to shoot. The camera's noisy little motor drive will automatically advance the film to the next frame. Keeping it held down will make it shoot again just under a second later. This might be a good idea if you're down in the slowly-blinking-P range (since it increases the chance that one of the shots won't be blurred by camera shake), otherwise you're wasting film by doing this. Keep moving and shooting until you hit the end of the roll. The camera will beep loudly at you when you're out of film. Unloading the film Press the rewind release button on the bottom of the camera.  Lift out the rewind crank lever and turn it clockwise. Keep going. You'll feel the crank get stiffer for a bit, then there will be a very obvious release of tension as the camera lets go of the film. Turn it a few more times after that. Lift up the rewind crank to open the back of the camera. Then drop the film out. Get the film developed and scanned (don't bother doing the last part yourself). Show the results off to the world. Thanks to its compatibility with some extraordinarily cheap lenses with great optics, the results you get from this camera will be every bit as good as the results from more complicated and expensive cameras like the Canon A-1, or even pro cameras like the F-1. The T50's lack of manual settings is loved by experienced photographers even as they curse it; it forces the photographer to think about nothing but how well they are composing the picture.",
