If you notice light brown or black stains that are of medium consistency you are leaking oil. A few drops is normal, but anything larger should be investigated. Reddish, light brown, or black stains that are near the center of the car is usually transmission fluid. If the color is similar to the transmission fluid (or could also be a purplish hue), but is located in the front of the car, it is your power steering fluid. Finding a pale brownish stain that is very slippery would indicate a brake fluid leak. A spot of brightly colored fluid is coolant (sometimes called \"antifreeze\"). Coolant comes in a variety of colors including green, red and yellow. If you find a clear liquid leaking out, this is sometimes condensation of air conditioner water that is normal. However, if this spews out continuously, you'll need to have your car's radiator and air conditioner system checked."
