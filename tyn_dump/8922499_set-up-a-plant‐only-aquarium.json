        "Hairgrass, wood, and rocks are used to create the illusion of a scene usually seen on ground.",
        "Add nutritional supplements if needed.",
        "There are different forms of nutrients, from pellets to solutions.",
        "Add the right amount according to your tank and follow instructions to the T. Since there are no fish (even if you will add invertebrates), there will be minimal waste for the plants to utilize.",
        "This is key to a healthy tank.",
        "Follow suppliers' instructions.",
        "Don\u2019t just put in whatever seems reasonable.",
        "Too much can burn the roots and plants or mess up water chemistry.",
        "Add the plants.",
        "Rinse off debris with normal tap water and snip off any yellow or dead parts.",
        "Hopefully, you\u2019ve devised a plan on how to arrange them by size and kinds, so work logically.",
        "Some plants have a rhizome similar to roots -- but some of those should not be buried, so be careful to read each of their requirements.",
        "Plants that grow on wood can be tucked into crevices or held in place gently by a temporary, weak rubber band.",
        "Rooted plants should have their roots tucked completely into the substrate.",
        "Floating plants can be anchored to aquarium weights or rocks, or left to freely wander.",
        "Performing Maintenance Check and modify the water every two weeks or so.",
        "Even if less waste is being produced than in a fish tank, the nitrates will eventually build up.",
        "Depending on whether you put special invertebrates in (see \u201cAdding Invertebrates\u201d) depending on your tank size, and your number of plants, this frequency will change.",
        "This is a general rule.",
        "Replace 25% of the water, correctly treated and with aquarium/sea salt for health of freshwater fish if you want.",
        "Once in a while, use your gravel or substrate vacuum to clean the substrate surface of rotting organic matter.",

        "Doug has worked in the aquarium and fish-care industry for over 20 years, including having worked as a professional aquarist for the Minnesota Zoo and Shedd Aquarium in Chicago.",
        "He received his Bachelor of Science in Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior from the University of Minnesota.",
        "Doug Ludemann\t\t\tProfessional Aquarist\t\t\t\tMonitor your tank's pH level to keep it just below 7.0.",
        "Plants have a preference for ammonium, which is present in a slightly acidic environment, which occurs at a pH below 7.0.",
        "In an alkaline environment, or anything above 7.0, ammonium becomes ammonia, which is bad for your plants.",
        "Top off your tank as needed.",
        "If you use salt as an electrolyte or supplement for aquatic health, do not add salt to the water when you are only topping it off!",
        "When water evaporates from your tank, the salt does not evaporate with it.",
        "Adding more salt can make the tank too salty.",
        "As always, condition the water.",
        "Add fertilizers if needed.",
        "Some substrate fertilizers last for a very long time and do not need to be bothered for months.",
        "Some liquid varieties require weekly additions, so make sure you keep up on that.",
        "A carbon dioxide supplement (recalling that plants make and give off oxygen but need carbon dioxide given off by fish and other animals) can be useful as well, added weekly, and does not harm any animal or plant if used with the correct proportions.",
        "Scrubbing off algae may need to be done once in a while to keep up the appearance.",
        "Algae is not harmful unless it starts to block out light and suck up too many nutrients.",
        "A soft-padded brush (available at pet stores) easily gets the job done.",
        "Algae on plants is usually fine.",
        "If it bothers you, lightly rub it off with your fingers.",
        "Avoid too much algae by keeping the tank away from sun, not using too-strong lights, and not overdoing fertilizer/supplements.",
        "Adding Invertebrates (Optional) Like with getting any new pet, research on what is acceptable for your current tank.",
        "These should be added to an established planted tank.",
        "Common invertebrates such as mystery snails and shrimp actually function as tank \u201ccleaners\u201d, eating waste, dead matter.",
        "Many species are peaceful, but some can be incredibly aggressive.",
        "Some prefer open space, while others prefer hiding spaces.",
        "Be mindful.",
        "Most pet store variety invertebrates only eat dead matter, but some do eat live plants.",
        "Furnishing their needs and protecting your aquatic plants can include putting in bits of plant material.",
        "Pick healthy specimens.",
        "Bright colors (if applicable), active movements, and an intact body indicate good health.",
        "Ask the pet supplier about the conditioning of their invertebrates tanks to get a sense of how they are handled by them.",
        "If you see a tank with dead or diseased organisms (even fish), it may be best to pass on the invertebrates in there.",
        "Don\u2019t be afraid to request particular sizes and kinds of specimens!",
        "This is common and acceptable.",
        "Avoid buying baby invertebrates for an unestablished tank.",
        "They generally do not do well in a newly prepared tank.",
        "Add them in slowly and acclimate them.",
        "You should not add more than a few of any animal in at one time, to let the tank get used to it.",
        "Adding them in means that you should put them in a bucket of your tank water and gently scoop them out of the bag of store water.",
        "Dumping the bag\u2019s contents into your tank can stress them and introduce questionable pet-store water into your water.",
        "The best method to acclimate them is to simply float the animals\u2019 bag in the tank water for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Feed them properly.",
        "Giving them debris from cleaning a fish tank does not provide enough food for invertebrates.",
        "Giving them a balanced diet of bits of vegetables, pellets, or frozen foods ensures healthiness.",
        "You want to make your invertebrates part of the whole underwater scene, not just a side attraction.",
        "Feed them well and they will grow beautifully!",
        "Inadequate feeding of vegetable food will push normal scavengers into eating your plants at times, so protect your plants by feeding adequately.",
        "Remove food after a few hours/within the day if not eaten, to prevent mold/algae.",
        "Enjoy the sight of your creatures among your nice plants!",
        "Shrimp can enhance visual appeal of the tank, while tidying it.",
        "This type of tank can sustain/clean itself nicely, with animals and plants working together.",
        "Still, take care of your tank!"
