Massaging your scalp ensures the argan oil gets deep into your scalp, which is helpful when treating dandruff or an itchy head. It may take several weeks or months to notice significant results. If you have a very oily scalp, apply the oil about 1 in (2.5 cm) from your roots to prevent excessively greasy hair."

This is because the highly-concentrated oil deeply penetrates your hair, which helps keep your hair soft. If your hair is excessively brittle or damaged, your hair may need more oil. In this case, it\u2019s okay to apply the argan oil every day."

Use a liberal amount of oil to saturate your hair. 6 to 8 drops should be enough for most hair types, though you can use more if you have very long or damaged hair. For instance, if you have a short, pixie style, you only need 2 to 4 drops of oil. If you have long, thick hair, you may need to use 10 or more drops of argan oil. If the ends of your hair are split or very dull, apply a bit more oil on the tips of your hair. You can comb through your hair to distribute the oil evenly.
