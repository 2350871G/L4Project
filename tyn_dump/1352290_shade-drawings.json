You can space the lines closer together to make darker shadows or the lines can be spaced further apart to make the area seem brighter. Pull hatching lines in one long stroke to keep them uniform. Hatching lines can be horizontal, vertical, or at an angle. Follow the angles and curves of objects with the shapes of your line to simulate a three-dimensional form. For example, shade a round object with curved lines rather than straight lines."

For example, first, make parallel horizontal lines and then layer vertical lines on top of them. This method of shading allows you to make areas darker quicker than basic hatching. Draw the cross-hatching lines close together to make a densely shaded area on your drawing or spread them apart to make it lighter. Use hatch marks without a second layer to make a lighter shadow."

Shade with the side of a soft graphite pencil and increase the amount of pressure you apply to the paper to make transitions between light and dark values. Art pencils have varying degrees of hardness and are labeled with a number and either the letter B or H. Soft graphite is labeled with the letter B and gets softer with a higher number. Hard graphite is labeled with the letter H and is more difficult to use for smooth transitions the higher the number goes. A standard number 2 pencil has an HB hardness, which is a medium between hard and soft graphite. Practice shading on simple polygon forms, like cubes and spheres before jumping in to shade your drawing."
