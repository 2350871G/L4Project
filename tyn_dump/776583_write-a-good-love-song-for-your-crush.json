There are many ways to set up the rhyming structure of your chorus and there\u2019s no right or wrong way to go about doing it.

For example, you may repeat the line, \u201cI think you\u2019re great\u201d three times. When writing a four line chorus, rhyme the first line to the third line and the second line to the fourth line. For example, you may have the lines: \u201cI think you\u2019re great/We would be so good together/You\u2019re the perfect mate/I think we could be forever.\u201d\nMake the first and third lines the same and make the second and fourth lines the same.

For example, you may have the lines: \u201cI think you\u2019re great/The perfect mate/I can\u2019t wait/For us to be together.\u201d\nMake all four lines completely different.

        "Part of what makes a good chorus is setting up and paying off a rhyme.",
        "There are many ways to set up the rhyming structure of your chorus and there\u2019s no right or wrong way to go about doing it.",
        "Your options for the rhyming structure are:\nRepeat the same line at least three times.",
        "If you choose to do this, make sure the line is fun to say or sing.",
        "For example, you may repeat the line, \u201cI think you\u2019re great\u201d three times.",
        "When writing a four line chorus, rhyme the first line to the third line and the second line to the fourth line.",
        "For example, you may have the lines: \u201cI think you\u2019re great/We would be so good together/You\u2019re the perfect mate/I think we could be forever.\u201d\nMake the first and third lines the same and make the second and fourth lines the same.",
        "For example, you may have the lines: \u201cI think you\u2019re great/We would be so good together/You\u2019re the perfect mate/I think we could be something special.\u201d\nMake the first three lines the same, then diverge from the pattern for the fourth line.",
        "For example, you may have the lines: \u201cI think you\u2019re great/The perfect mate/I can\u2019t wait/For us to be together.\u201d\nMake all four lines completely different.",
        "For example, you may have the lines: \u201cI think you\u2019re great/We would be so good together/You\u2019re my ideal/I want to date you.\u201d Put the choruses in order.",
        "There are many different places a chorus can go within the confines of a song.",
        "Most people choose to alternate verses and choruses, but there is no hard and fast rule on this.",
        "Some songs repeat the chorus of the song over and over to help signify that the song is ending.",
        "If you choose to add a bridge, you\u2019ll want to position an additional chorus after the bridge.",
        "Make the chorus memorable.",
        "Your chorus will continue to reappear throughout the course of the song, so it\u2019s important that the chorus be catchy enough that your crush will want to listen to it over and over again.",
        "Infuse the chorus with emotion to help show your crush how you really feel.",
        "You may talk about your feelings and emotions as well as the qualities that you appreciate in your crush.",
        "Another option is to write a chorus that sounds completely different from the rest of the verses.",
        "Try mixing up the rhythm or chord projections, changing keys or applying shifts in volume.",
        "If you know how, you can also add harmonies or instruments to enhance the chorus.",
        "Writing the Verses Write down how you feel about your crush.",
        "The verses will make up the majority of your song, so you want to use them to show your crush how you really feel about them.",
        "Brainstorm ideas by writing down your feelings, memories, or any moments you\u2019ve spent with your crush that have made you happy.",
        "Read the writing out loud and look for keywords that stand out.",
        "Make a list of these words and use them as the foundation for your verse lyrics.",
        "Build on texts you\u2019ve already written about your crush.",
        "If you\u2019ve ever written anything about your crush, you can use your previous writing in your song lyrics.",
        "Look back at old diary entries, texts, tweets or poems you\u2019ve written to or about your crush.",
        "Try taking an individual line from something you\u2019ve already written and building this into the verses of your song.",
        "You can also look at things your crush has written to or about you and mine those for inspiration.",
        "Figure out the rhyming pattern.",
        "Verses, like choruses, don\u2019t always rhyme.",
        "If you want your verses to rhyme, check out a rhyming dictionary and look for places where you can change words to fit your rhyming pattern.",
        "Your words don\u2019t always have to rhyme perfectly.",
        "Try using slant rhymes (like rhyming kiss and abyss).",
        "It\u2019s better to have a song that doesn\u2019t rhyme then to pick words that rhyme but don\u2019t make sense in your song.",
        "Make the verses personal and specific to your crush.",
        "You are writing a love song for your crush only.",
        "You should try to make the lyrics specific to your crush, as this will make the song seem more genuine and heartfelt.",
        "Use personal experiences and details about your crush in the song.",
        "You may include inside jokes that you both share, such as a funny moment at work or at school.",
        "You may mention the inside joke in your lyrics to add a nice personal touch to the song.",
        "You may also mention specific details or traits that you admire or like about your crush.",
        "Try mentioning a specific moment when you noticed this trait or detail, such as the time your crush helped you solve a problem on the computer, showing you that they are sexy and computer savvy.",
        "Or the time your crush helped you move into your new apartment, a moment where you realized your crush was strong and supportive.",
        "Avoid cliche descriptions and details.",
        "Love songs can become familiar and generic very fast, as there are too many cliches out there about love.",
        "A cliche is a phrase that has become so familiar it loses its meaning.",
        "You should avoid cliches in your love song so it feels specific to your crush and makes the emotional impact you are hoping for.",
        "For example, avoid familiar descriptions of love, like \u201cmy love is deep\u201d or \u201cmy love is everlasting.\u201d You should also avoid describing your feelings for your crush with cliche details, like \u201cmy heart cries for you\u201d or \u201cI want you so bad.\u201d\nInstead, go for descriptions and details that feel unique and unfamiliar.",
        "Try describing your feelings for your crush in a funny and creative way, like \u201cI like you more than cheese pizza and upside down cake\u201d or \u201cI think you\u2019re cooler than anyone I know.\u201d Make the lyrics fun and interesting so your crush gets drawn into your love song.",
        "Writing the Bridge Write the lyrics for the bridge.",
        "A bridge is used to break up a song \u2013 it\u2019s a departure from the verses and chorus and can infuse a totally different feeling into a piece of music.",
        "Write lyrics for the bridge that are emotionally based and that heighten the feeling of love in your song.",
        "If you spend the entire song talking about how much you love your crush, use the bridge to describe the feeling you get when they\u2019re not around.",
        "Build the energy throughout the bridge to help make your final chorus that much more powerful.",
        "Switch up the melody in the bridge.",
        "Since the bridge is meant to be a change from the rest of the song, you want to use the bridge\u2019s melody to reflect that.",
        "Experiment with writing a new chord progression for the bridge.",
        "If the rest of the song is in a major key, switch to minor for the bridge.",
        "Borrow chord progressions from different keys for the bridge.",
        "Since the bridge is a heightening of the song, play around with setting the bridge in a higher key.",
        "End the bridge with an open chord or non-tonic chord.",
        "Add the bridge to the song.",
        "Most songs are laid out like this: verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus.",
        "Your song does not have to follow this format, but you can definitely use it as a template as you construct the order of your song.",
        "Some songs include third verses.",
        "If you have a third verse, position the third verse after the bridge, but before the last chorus.",
        "If you only have two verses, repeat the chorus twice after the bridge to capitalize on the energy built in the bridge section."
