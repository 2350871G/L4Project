If you want to add a little more volume to your style, mist some dry shampoo onto your hair instead, focusing on the roots. Getting Waves without Heat Dampen your hair and part it down the middle. Your hair needs to be damp in order for this to work, so either mist it with water from a spray bottle, or take a quick shower. Next, part your hair down the middle. You can change your part later, after you have created the waves. You need an equal amount of hair on each side of your hair. Make sure that your hair is not dripping wet, or it will take too long to dry. Gather a section of hair from the front and split it in half. Choose a side on your head to start on: left or right. Next, gather a section of hair from the front of your head, right next to the part. Split that section in half. The section should be at least twice the width of your index finger. Twist both sections together 2 times. Twist each section downwards individually first to create 2 ropes. Next, twist the sections together upwards by bringing the outermost section over the inner section. This process is sort of like creating a rope braid. Add some hair to the outer rope. Gather a long, vertical section of hair, spanning from your part down to your hairline, and add it to the outer rope. Depending on the direction you split your hair in, this section will either be on the bottom or next to your face. This step is similar to French braiding or French rope braiding. Twist the ropes together once, and repeat until you reach your nape. This is similar to French braiding, except that you are only adding hair to the bottom/outer section.

Twist the rope(s) into a bun, then secure it with a hair tie. Don\u2019t add the hair from the other side of the part into the bun. Repeat process for the other side of your head. Gather a section of hair from the other side of your head. Create a French rope braid, only adding hair to the bottom strand. Finish with a bun, then secure the bun with a second hair tie. All of your hair should be gathered into your buns at this point. Let your hair dry completely. Depending on how thick and porous your hair is, expect to wait least 6 hours or overnight for your hair to dry.
