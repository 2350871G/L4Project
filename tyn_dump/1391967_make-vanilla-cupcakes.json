The liners will make it easy to remove and serve the cupcakes. Set the tin aside while you make the batter. If you don't have paper liners, spray the inside of the muffin tin with a nonstick cooking spray. Whisk the flour, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest. Put 1 1/2 cups (195 g) of all-purpose flour into a bowl and add 1 1/2 teaspoons (6 g) of baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon (1.5 g) of salt, and the zest of 1 large lemon.

If you don't have a stand mixer, use a regular mixing bowl and beat the butter with a hand mixer or wooden spoon. Cream the butter with the sugar for 2 minutes on medium speed.

Avoid beating the batter for too long or the cupcakes will become tough. Stop beating as soon as the flour and milk are combined. Baking the Cupcakes Divide the batter between the paper-lined muffin cavities. Set your lined muffin tin on your work surface and use a cookie scoop to fill each cavity about half full with batter. Ensure that each cavity has roughly the same amount of batter so the cupcakes bake evenly. If you don't have a cookie scoop, use 1 or 2 spoons to scoop the batter into the tin. To make mini-cupcakes, spray a mini-cupcake tin and divide the batter between 24 mini-cavities. Bake the vanilla cupcakes for 17 to 20 minutes. Put the muffin tin into the preheated oven and bake the cupcakes until they spring back when you gently touch them in the center. You can also test to see if the cupcakes are done by inserting a toothpick into the center of a cupcake. If the toothpick comes out clean, the cupcakes are done. Cool the cupcakes on a wire rack. Remove the baked vanilla cupcakes from the oven and turn them out onto a wire rack. Leave them to cool completely before you frost them. Avoid frosting the cupcakes while they're still warm or the frosting will slide off of the cupcakes. Making the Buttercream Whip the butter on medium-high speed for 5 minutes. Put 1 cup (227 g) of room temperature butter into the bowl of a stand mixer. Turn the mixer to medium-high and beat the butter until it becomes light and fluffy. Stop the mixer and scrape the sides of the bowl once or twice. If you don't have a stand mixer, use a mixing bowl and beat the butter with a hand mixer or wooden spoon. Beat in the powdered sugar on low speed. Turn the mixer speed down to low and slowly add 2\u00bd cups (283 g) of powdered sugar to the creamed butter. It will take up to 1 minute for the powdered sugar to combine with the butter. If you add the powdered sugar while the mixer is still on medium-high speed, it will fly out of the sides of the bowl. Mix in the vanilla extract and beat the frosting for 2 minutes. Turn the mixer speed up to medium-high and pour in 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract. Beat the vanilla buttercream until it's pale and fluffy. Stop and scrape down the bowl as needed. Frost the cooled cupcakes. Once the cupcakes have cooled completely, use an offset spatula to spread some of the vanilla buttercream over each of them. Then top the cupcakes with garnishes if you like and serve them. For a decorative look, pipe the frosting onto the cupcakes. Garnishes include sprinkles, edible flowers, cocoa powder, small candies, and fresh berries.
