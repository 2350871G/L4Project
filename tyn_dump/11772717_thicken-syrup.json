The more syrup you put in your saucepan, the longer it will take to reduce. If you have a lot of syrup you want to thicken up, you can use 2 saucepans.

If it starts to boil, turn the heat down so that it doesn\u2019t get too hot.Leave your saucepan uncovered so that the liquid has somewhere to evaporate. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it reaches 223 \u00b0F (106 \u00b0C). Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature in the middle of your saucepot. Once it reaches between 223 and 230 \u00b0F (106 and 110 \u00b0C), it will be thick enough to stick to pancakes or cake.Keep your syrup below 241 \u00b0F (116 \u00b0C) so that it doesn\u2019t get too thick. Take your syrup off the heat when it is hot enough. Turn off the heat and let your syrup cool down for about 2 minutes. Serve your syrup while it\u2019s still warm, and use it to sweeten up pancakes, french toast, or ice cream.Tip: You can track the level of your syrup by finding the mark that the syrup made on the sides of the saucepan when it was first poured in. Using Cornstarch Make a 1:1 ratio of cornstarch and water. In a small bowl, combine equal amounts of cornstarch and warm water, starting with 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of each.

Adding Gelatin Simmer your syrup for 10 minutes on medium heat. Put your syrup in a wide, deep saucepan with high sides and turn your stovetop to medium heat. Allow your syrup to simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring it occasionally so that the bottom doesn\u2019t burn. Gelatin works the best in liquids that have already been warmed up. Take your syrup off the heat. Turn the stovetop off and move the saucepot off the hot burner. Set it to the side and let the syrup sit for about 1 minute to cool down slightly.Tip: Don\u2019t leave your syrup for longer than 1 minute, or it could start to harden up again. Add 1 tbsp (14 g) of powdered gelatin to your syrup. Use a powdered, flavorless gelatin and stir it in with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes. Make sure you let it dissolve completely so that you can\u2019t see any of the powder left in your syrup.Flavorless gelatin won\u2019t change the taste of your syrup. You can find flavorless gelatin at most grocery stores. Keep adding gelatin in 1 tbsp (14 g) increments if you need to.
