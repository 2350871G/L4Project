The ideal time to cut is from mid-spring until late summer, when the temperature is consistently warm outside and the flowers are actively blooming. If you take the cuttings during the blooming season, the cuttings are ready to plant and grow. The gardenia growing season is usually over by the fall, so cuttings taken then won't grow as well. The branches will be more dried out and hard. Cut a 5 in (13 cm) green section from the tip of a branch. Green branches, or softwood, are the healthiest and grow best.

If the cutting has a flower, snip this off as well. A flower takes energy away from the cutting and it will have trouble growing a root system. Potting the Cuttings Mix equal parts of sand and peat moss in a small pot. This is the best rooting mixture for gardenia cuttings.
