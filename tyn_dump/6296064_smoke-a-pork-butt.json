Inject some of the marinade directly into the pork and pour the rest over the meat. You'll use the reserved portion of marinade to baste the pork as it smokes. Never reuse marinade that touches raw meat for basting purposes as the meat cooks. Place the meat into a shallow baking dish before injecting it since some of the marinade may seep out. You should inject marinade into the meat at four or five spots, spaced evenly around the pork butt. At each injection site, insert the loaded needle and inject only one-third of the marinade. Instead of completely removing the needle, turn it into the same spot at a different angle and inject another third of the marinade. Repeat once more at the same injection site. After injecting the marinade into the pork, place the meat inside a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the rest of the marinade and any injection drippings inside the bag, as well, then seal the bag and turn it as needed to coat all sides of the pork."

By allowing the pork butt to sit out at room temperature, you also bring the internal temperature of the meat closer to room temperature. Room temperature pork will cook quicker than cold pork.

To avoid contaminating the mixture with bacteria from undercooked pork, transfer it to a sterile spray bottle and spray it over the surface of the pork rather than brushing it on. If you forgot to set aside some of the marinade for basting or if you run out of it during the smoking process, quickly whisk together a new half batch using 1 cup (250 ml) apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup (125 ml) vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) salt, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) paprika, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) Worcestershire sauce, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) ground black pepper."
