Wet a soft cloth with water. Then take the damp cloth and carefully clean the shoes. Rub the shoes with denatured alcohol. Once you have removed as much dirt as possible with the damp rag, rub the shoes with denatured alcohol. This will remove any remaining wax or polish from the shoes. Take a dry, clean cloth and saturate it with alcohol. Then gently rub the entire surface of each shoe. Allow the shoes to dry. Once you are done rubbing the shoes with denatured alcohol, let them dry completely. Allow the shoes to air dry. Do not attempt to bronze shoes that are still damp from the cleaning process. Creating a Wire Loop and Positioning the Shoes Make a hole in the sole of each shoe. You will be stringing a piece of wire through each shoe, and using the wire to hang the shoes to dry in between coats of bronze. Try using a box cutter, knife, or drill to make the hole. Make sure you exercise caution while cutting the hole, and avoid accidentally cutting yourself. String wire through the hole. Begin by creating a wire loop for each shoe. Take some sturdy, yet flexible wire and string it through the hole in the sole of the shoe. Then twist the wire to create a closed loop that is large enough to use for hanging the shoe. Repeat the process for both shoes. Arrange the shoes. Position the shoes so the laces and tongues are arranged precisely how you want them to be for bronzing. Make sure you tie the shoelaces. Finally, adjust the tongue of each shoe so that it is touching both sides of the shoe. Try using a little bit of rubber cement or super glue to lock the laces and/or tongue into the desired position. Applying Bronze to the Shoes Prepare the liquid bronze in a bowl. Mix bronze powder with a quick-drying spar varnish according to the package directions in a plastic or glass bowl. Stir the liquid bronze thoroughly to prevent particles from settling in the bottom of the bowl. You can purchase liquid bronze at a hardware store or print supply company. Apply a coat of liquid bronze to each shoe. Hold the shoe by the wire loop with your non-dominant hand. Then use your dominant hand to apply a thin coat of liquid bronze to each shoe with a camel hair brush. Start on the top of each shoe and work your way down the sides toward the sole.
