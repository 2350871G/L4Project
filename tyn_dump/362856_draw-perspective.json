You could also make a drawing of the ocean with the sun rising or setting. The sun would be the vanishing point that makes the ocean look as though it extends far away from you. Keep in mind that the subjects closer to you should be larger than the ones that are near the horizon.

For example, use a two-point perspective if you're sketching a country scene with a barn in the distance. Use a three-point perspective if you're drawing skyscrapers close to the viewer.

To make a building or cube, locate the perspective lines from the vanishing points that are on your horizon. Make a square along these lines to make the base.

        "Adding a Third Vanishing Point Use a three-point perspective if you want your drawing to show height.",
        "You'll probably use two-point perspective for most of your drawings unless you want the viewer to feel like they're looking up or down at the subject.",
        "For example, use a two-point perspective if you're sketching a country scene with a barn in the distance.",
        "Use a three-point perspective if you're drawing skyscrapers close to the viewer.",
        "Place a vanishing point above or below the horizon line.",
        "Make a horizon line with two vanishing points on it as though you're doing two-point perspective.",
        "Then, decide if you want to put the third vanishing point below the horizon or above it.",
        "If you want to sketch looking down on your subject, make the line under the horizon or position it above the horizon if you want the viewer to look up.Tip: You may need to adjust your horizon line if you want to show an extreme three-point perspective.",
        "For example, if you're drawing a skyscraper, bring the horizon lower so you have more room for the subject.",
        "Remember that the horizon line represents your viewer's eye level.",
        "Draw lines that extend from the extra vanishing point.",
        "Set your ruler on the third vanishing point and draw 3 or 4 lines that move up towards the horizon or down across the horizon.",
        "You'll use this grid with the perspective lines from the other vanishing points.",
        "Create geometric shapes with extreme depth.",
        "To make a building or cube, locate the perspective lines from the vanishing points that are on your horizon.",
        "Make a square along these lines to make the base.",
        "Then, sketch along the lines from the third vanishing point to create the sides and close the bottom of the shape using the lines from the horizon line's vanishing point.",
        "Note that the vertical sides of your building or cube won't be parallel in three-point perspective.",
        "Instead, they should slant up or down towards at an angle.",
        "Now you're ready to draw perspective!",
