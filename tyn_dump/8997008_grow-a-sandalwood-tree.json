The sandalwood tree connects its root system to that of the host tree in order to get the nutrients it needs. Ideally, you should plant your sandalwood next to an already-established host species, such as long-lived wattles (acacia trees) or casuarinas (a genus of tropical evergreens, including ironwoods and sheoaks). If you need to plant a host species, space them between the sandalwood trees at intervals of 1.6-2 meters (5.2-6.5 feet). Cajanus cajan (pigeon pea) is another good host species for sandalwood trees."
