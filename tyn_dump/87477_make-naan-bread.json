Add the salt and baking powder and stir through. Slowly add the remaining teaspoon of sugar, and the milk and yeast mixture, the oil, yogurt and egg. Mix to form a dough. Knead the dough well. When it is smooth and well formed, shape it into a ball. Cover and place aside in a warm place. Allow to rise for an hour. Preheat the oven to 225\u00baC/425\u00baF. Prepare a baking sheet by lining with parchment paper or a silicone sheet. (You could grease it instead, if preferred.) Knead the risen dough. Then divide it into nine even pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Place the first ball onto a floured surface. Using a rolling pin, roll the ball out flat. Repeat for all the other balls. Place the flat bread on the prepared baking sheet or sheets. Place straight into the center of the oven, as many as sensibly fit. (Do the baking in rounds.) Bake for 6 to 8 minutes. The naans are ready when they are slightly browned. Wrap baked naans in a fresh tea towel while baking the remaining ones. Serve hot. Naan goes well with dhal, curries and seasoned vegetable dishes. Plain Naan Variant Sift together the flour and salt. Place into a large bowl. Add the yeast to the lukewarm milk in a separate small bowl. Put to one side for 15 minutes. Make a well in the center of the flour and salt mix. Pour the activated yeast mixture in, along with the oil, yogurt and egg. Stir together to combine into a soft dough. Flour a work surface lightly.

Aim for a shape somewhat akin to a teardrop or pear. The thickness to aim for is around 5 to 8mm (1/2 to 1/3 inch), with the length approximately 25cm (10 inches) and the width approximately 13xm/5 inches wide. Preheat the grill on high. Remove the baking sheets or trays from the oven while using oven mitts. Place the naan on the hot sheet or tray, then bake for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the oven when it has puffed up. Place until the hot grill just for a few seconds. It should brown slightly, then it's done. Repeat for each remaining ball or piece of dough. Cooked naans should be wrapped in a clean tea towel to keep warm. Serve immediately. Spread melted butter or ghee or some favorite edible oil on the naans and serve with the main meal.
