When you\u2019re applying wounds, crush up some oatmeal or corn flakes and attach them with liquid latex. Let the latex dry completely before painting over the oatmeal to make it look like a wound. The oatmeal or corn flakes will give the wound a bumpier texture and make it seem more realistic. Blend the wound into your skin tone with foundation.

Adding Scary Details Cut and paint wooden dowels to look like broken bones. Pick wooden dowels that are the same thickness as the bone you\u2019re trying to replicate and cut the end at an angle.

Wrap liquid latex and toilet paper around the sides of the dowel and paint it to look like a bone sticking out from someone\u2019s skin. Roll up paper towels with liquid latex to make fake guts.

Set up a fog machine in the location where you\u2019re filming your horror movie and run a fog machine so the room it fills the area. Run the fog machine in between takes to make it appear more full. The fog makes your film set look more mysterious and can make your movie scarier. Check party supply stores to see if they offer fog machine rentals. Otherwise, you can buy them online. Record sound effects with common household materials. Many sounds you hear in movies are added later and are made from objects you may have around the house. Record creaky floors, squeaking doors, and loud footsteps so you can add them to your film if you need to. Experiment with breaking, hitting, or handling a variety of different objects since they may make sounds you could use later on. For example, you may snap a celery stalk in half to use as the sound of a bone breaking or hit a watermelon with a hammer to simulate hitting someone else. If you need to record sounds for a creature or monster, try making the noises yourself and adjusting them in audio editing software. Film in front of a green screen so you can add a scary background later. Hang a green screen in front of a wall so you or your actors can stand in front of it. Point the camera at the green screen and record the scene you want to shoot. When you edit your footage, you can use video editing software to add in a different background so you don\u2019t have to shoot on location. You can buy green screens online. You can also use a plain green sheet as long as it doesn\u2019t have wrinkles in it.Warning: Don\u2019t let an actor wear the same color as your green screen or else they will also disappear when you edit your footage. Try lighting your movie from different angles. Test different lighting setups while you film to see what makes your shots look creepier. Put the lights underneath your actors or monsters to make them look more sinister. Have your actor stand in front of a light to cast an ominous shadow on set. Try the same shot with your different setups so you can have the option to use them later if you want. Use different light sources for your scenes. If a character is exploring in the dark, use the light of a flashlight to make your scene look scarier. Add color and animated effects with digital software. Download software like Adobe After Effects or Blender to add additional effects once you\u2019re finished filming. You can try making 3D models and animating them if you need to make a creature or effect you couldn\u2019t do practically. Adjust the color filters to blue or green for a classic horror effect and to make your movie feel creepier. You may need to pay for advanced editing software. Look for video tutorials for the effect you\u2019re trying to achieve to find detailed explanations of the process.",
