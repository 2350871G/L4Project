Rat droppings, which look like small, brown grains of rice, are one of the main signs to look for. Also, spot any parts of the attic the rats have been gnawing on. Rats tend to travel back and forth across areas they know are safe, so you can catch them by putting traps in their paths. Rats often chew on wood and insulation, especially along the floor. Also, note any holes in the wall and roof. If any part of your attic is dusty, you may be able to spot tracks left behind by the rats."

Try positioning a few traps near openings in the wall, close to where you see tracks or droppings, and behind furniture. For a better chance at catching the rats, set up lots of traps. If you\u2019re only dealing with a handful of rats, you could set out a dozen traps. If you\u2019re dealing with an infestation, set out up to 3 dozen traps. Snap traps are ideal since they are effective and reusable. Position them so they are perpendicular to the wall.

        "You can then place the rat and the remaining bait in a garbage bag.",
        "For safety, get a tamper-proof bait station to house the bait.",
        "Poison traps usually aren\u2019t ideal and may be legally regulated in your area.",
        "They can be dangerous to children, pets, and other animals.",
        "One downside of poison baits is that they aren\u2019t instantaneous.",
        "The rat will live for a while.",
        "It may crawl into a hidden spot, like your wall, and begin decaying before you find it.",
        "Protecting Your Attic from Rats Inspect your home for gaps allowing rats to get inside.",
        "Set a ladder outside so you can climb up and get a clear view of your attic and roof.",
        "Check vents and chimneys to see if they are open or covered.",
        "Next, look for small holes in the siding and between the roof and the walls.",
        "Mark these spots as needed so you can fix them later.",
        "Although rats are bigger than mice, they are still capable of squeezing through very tiny holes.",
        "Every opening has to be covered to prevent infestations.",
        "Seal off gaps with metal covers and caulk.",
        "Cap your chimney with a metal cover, then position grates over vents and other openings.",
        "Fill in cracks and small holes with a silicone caulk.",
        "Using a caulk gun, squeeze caulk from the bottle until each gap is completely filled.",
        "You can also caulk and cover gaps inside your home for additional protection.",
        "For the best result, deal with gaps before you start setting rat traps.",
        "Without the gaps, the rats can\u2019t get outside and will be more likely to walk into the traps.",
        "Gaps have to be filled so that more rats can\u2019t get inside.",
        "Cut back trees and vines near your attic.",
        "Roof rats climb up trees and tall structures to get into your home.",
        "Prune trees and bushes by cutting off old branches.",
        "Make sure they are 3 ft (0.91 m) or more from your home.",
        "Pull down vines growing on your home or nearby walls.",
        "Pruning trees and bushes takes away some hiding spots for the rats.",
        "It leaves them more exposed to natural predators like birds, dogs, cats, and snakes.",
        "You can\u2019t really do anything with walls and other tall structures, so improvise.",
        "Try placing small, enclosed traps near your attic in case any rats climb up there.",
        "Call an exterminator if you need help dealing with an infestation.",
        "For the most part, you can take care of any rats in your attic through careful planning and determination.",
        "If you\u2019re not having any luck, let a professional lay down some traps.",
        "They will also identify how the rats are getting into your attic and provide recommendations for keeping them out.",
        "This is a good option for consistent pests you just can\u2019t seem to get rid of.",
        "Many exterminators depend on poison traps, which many not be the best or most efficient solution.",
        "Before hiring an exterminator, discuss how they plan on dealing with the problem.",
        "Extermination services cost much more than the basic traps you can buy and set up on your own.",
        "One visit may cost up to $300 USD."
