If you have slipped in maintaining a walking routine with your dog, reinstate it. If you haven't yet developed a routine, start now. And if you're not free to walk your dog regularly, find somebody who can. Go for regular walks and try to include a variety of exercise options during the walk. Some ideas include:\n\nBuy a leash that is only a few feet long. The closer your dog is when he walks with you, the more he'll know that you\u2019re the one who has the authority and is in control. Never let him walk behind you or ahead of you, but always right by your side. This lets him know you\u2019re in authority and he must submit. Take your dog on a walk in an area that is challenging. Try anywhere that has hills or an incline. Allow him to take breaks once in awhile and bring along water for him to drink as needed. Your dog may get in the habit of using the same trail, so switch it up to challenge him and keep him from getting bored. Visit a beach that allows dogs. The sand is excellent exercise for the dog's muscles, and the sea offers a fabulous opportunity for swimming and fetching all manner of items you can toss to your dog. If you don't want to take a ball, use the beach flotsam to play fetch with your pooch. Vary the parks you're visiting to walk your dog. Find out which parks allow dogs and vary your schedule each week to visit different ones. This will be stimulating for both of you, as you see new sights and explore new places."
