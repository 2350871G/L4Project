        "Make a side part for a cool, off-center style.",
        "Starting at your hairline, part your hair to the left or right side.",
        "As you trace the part back towards the crown, gradually bring it to the center.",
        "The part should be right down the center from the crown of your head down to the nape.",
        "Gather a thin section of hair from the left side.",
        "Clip or tie the right side of your hair out of the way.",
        "Next, gather a 2-inch (5-cm) wide section of hair from the left side of your hair, right at the hairline.",
        "You can start from the right side, if you prefer, but you'll need to do everything in reverse order.",
        "Split the section into 3 equal strands.",
        "Hold the left strand in your left hand, and the other 2 strands in your right.",
        "Keep the middle strand draped over your middle finger, and hold the right strand against your palm with your pinkie.",
        "Begin a standard braid.",
        "Cross the left strand under the middle strand, then cross the right strand under the new middle strand.",
        "Gently tug on the strands to tighten them.",
        "Make sure that you are crossing under the middle strand and not over, otherwise the Dutch braid won't work.",
        "If you are starting on the right side of your head, cross the right strand under the middle one first instead.",
        "Add some hair to the left strand, then cross it under.",
        "Gather a thin section of hair from the left side of your hairline, and add it to the left strand.",
        "Treating the two strands as one, cross them under the middle strand.",
        "Use your fingers to smooth down any stray strands of hair, if needed.",
        "The thin section should be a little smaller than the one you are adding it to.",
        "You can cross the left strand under the middle one, then add the thin section of hair to it.",
        "Some people find it easier that way.",
        "Repeat the process for the right strand.",
        "Gather a thin section of hair, this time  from the part.",
        "Add it to the right section to make it thicker, then cross it under the middle strand.",
        "Continue to Dutch braid until you reach your nape.",
        "Keep adding thin strands of hair to the left and right strands before crossing them under the middle one.",
        "Keep the strands even in size and tension.",
        "Try to center the braid between your part and hairline.",
        "Finish off with a regular braid.",
        "Gather whatever hair you have left over on the left side, and distribute it evenly between the left, right, and middle strands.",
        "Continue crossing the left and right strands under the middle one until you get to the end of your hair.",
        "Tie the braid off with a small hair tie.",
        "If you have very short hair, you may not have enough hair left to braid.",
        "Simply tie it off as a mini pigtail.",
        "Repeat the process on the other side of your head.",
        "Gather a thin section of hair from your hairline and split it into 3 smaller ones.",
        "Begin braiding with the right strand this time.",
        "Start with a regular braid for 2 cross unders, then continue with a Dutch braid until you reach your nape.",
        "Finish off with a regular braid, then tie it off.",
        "Wrap or twist the braids into a bun or crown, if desired.",
        "You don't have to do this at all, but it's a great way to update your style and get your hair off of your back.",
        "Alternatively, you can tie the 2 braids into a ponytail instead.",
        "Here are some ideas to get you started:\nMini buns: twist each braid into a bun, tucking the tails underneath and out of sight.",
        "Secure the buns with bobby pins.",
        "Braided crown: wrap the left regular braid around the back of your head and pin it to inside edge of the right Dutch braid.",
        "Repeat for the right braid and left Dutch braid.",
        "Relaxed ponytail: gather the 2 braids together and secure them with a hair tie.",
        "Remove the 2 smaller hair ties, and undo the braids.",
        "Wrap a thin strand of hair around the ponytail to hide the elastic, then secure it with a bobby pin."
