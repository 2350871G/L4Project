The most common indicator is a grease fitting that doubles as a wear indicator. That fitting, or boss, will stick out of the bottom of the joint\u2019s housing by about half an inch (1.25 centimeters). As it wears the boss will recede into the housing. As long as the boss protrudes out, the joint should be fine. Once the boss is flush with the housing or has receded even further, you\u2019ll need to replace the ball joint. This applies to older cars. Most new cars do not have wear indicators, or a grease fitting. If you can\u2019t find a wear indicator, or if the indicator doesn\u2019t give you a clear enough sign, raise up the car to inspect the joint more thoroughly."

If you don't do this, tension will still be on the ball joint when you jack up the car, making it difficult to move and look for play on the joint. Make sure there is no compression in the suspension when you check the ball joint. If you have control arms of unequal lengths, make sure the upper bump stop doesn\u2019t touch the control arm."

Grab the wheel at the top and bottom (12 and 6 o\u2019clock) to lift up and pull down. Move the dial gauge to the side of the nut and grab the tire at the bottom and move it in and out to check radial play of the joint. Read the dial indicator and check against the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. If the movement is beyond specifications, replace the ball joint. Experienced mechanics will also just check play by the feel, listening closely for any clicking or easy motion that suggests the ball joint is worn out.
