If you do not have a matcha scoop, measure out 1\u00bd teaspoon (2 grams) of matcha. Gently tap the sifter to sift the tea into the bowl. This will break up any clumps and give you a smoother matcha in the end. Usucha is a thinner type of matcha tea. Pour 2 ounces (60 milliliters) of hot water into a separate tea cup. The water needs to be just below boiling, about 165 to 180\u00b0F (75 to 80\u00b0C). Do not pour the hot water into the tea bowl with the matcha yet. Slowly pour the hot water into the tea bowl. This will help prevent the matcha from clumping. The hot water will also have warmed the tea cup up for you, making it ready for the tea.
