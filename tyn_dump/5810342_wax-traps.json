Make sure the wire is long enough so you can easily pull the trap out of the dye and wax later on. You can string multiple traps on the same length of wire if you need to dye and wax more than one. Dyeing Your Traps Bring 6 US gal (23 L) of water to a simmer. Use a large pot on an outdoor heat source, such as a campfire or propane grill. Pour at least 6 gallons (23 L) of water in the pot and heat it until it comes to a rolling simmer. Don\u2019t let the water boil or else it could damage your traps.

Put a large pot on your heat source and fill it halfway full with water. Put a second pot that\u2019s smaller inside the first pot so it\u2019s slightly submerged in the water. Make sure the second pot is sturdy and doesn\u2019t rock back and forth. Turn your heat to medium-high and bring the water to a boil.
