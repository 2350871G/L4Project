        "In addition, keep your plant away from drafty areas as much as possible.",
        "Even if you control the room temperature, windows, air vents, and heaters can cause the leaves to brown.",
        "If your fiddle leaf fig gets too cold, you may start seeing red spots on the new leaves.",
        "If this occurs, move your plant to a warmer location.",
        "Water your fiddle leaf fig about once per week when the soil feels dry.",
        "When your fiddle leaf fig\u2019s soil starts to feel slightly dry to the touch, water it until the soil is moistened.",
        "Leave the plant in the sink or outside for a few hours to let the water drain out the bottom so that the roots don\u2019t start to rot.",
        "While it\u2019s important not to overwater your struggling fiddle leaf fig, it\u2019s equally important that the soil doesn\u2019t completely dry out.",
        "Watering your plant about once per week should provide enough water to help revive it without over-moistening the soil.",
        "Fertilize your plant once a month except in the winter.",
        "During the spring, summer, and fall, add about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of liquid fertilizer to your fiddle leaf fig\u2019s soil.",
        "Avoid adding fertilizer during the winter or more than once per month so you don\u2019t give the plant more nutrients than it\u2019s able to utilize.",
        "Granular fertilizer can be hard to work with and you may risk over-fertilizing the plant.",
        "Using a liquid fertilizer is generally a safer bet because it's easier to control.",
        "For best results, use a fertilizer that is specifically formulated for fiddle leaf figs.",
        "If you can't find that, use an all-purpose fertilizer that contains approximately 30% nitrogen, 10% phosphorous, and 20% potassium.",
        "If your fiddle leaf fig has any mildew on its branches, avoid fertilizing until the mildew clears up.",
        "Encouraging New Growth Notch your fiddle leaf trunk to encourage it to grow new branches.",
        "First, decide where you want to encourage your fiddle leaf to sprout a new branch.",
        "Then, use a sharp knife to make a \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) cut on the trunk just above the node closest to your desired branch location.",
        "If you had to prune a lot of unhealthy branches and leaves, notching is a great way to help revive your fiddle leaf fig by encouraging it to grow new, healthy branches.",
        "A bit of white, sticky sap may drip out of the notched area.",
        "Cut off the newest growth to make it branch out more.",
        "To help revive your fiddle leaf fig and encourage it to grow more branches, try \u201cpinching\u201d your plant by cutting off the newest growth on the top of the tree with pruning shears.",
        "As the cut scabs over, it will force the plant to grow outward in multiple new directions from that spot.",
        "Pinching not only helps revive your fiddle leaf fig, it also allows you a bit of control over the shape your plant will take as it grows.",
        "Transfer your plant to a new pot when you see new growth.",
        "If your fiddle leaf fig\u2019s roots start to outgrow its current pot but your plant has been struggling, wait until you see new growth on the plant before repotting it.",
        "If you repot your fiddle leaf fig before it starts to revive, it may not be healthy enough to handle being disturbed and moved into a new environment.",
        "Once you notice new growth on your plant, transfer it into a larger pot to allow the roots more room to grow and thrive.",
        "You can repot your fiddle leaf fig during any season.",
        "Leave bare branches intact in case they re-sprout in the spring.",
        "To help encourage your fiddle leaf fig to grow, avoid pruning any brown, bare branches unless they\u2019re covered in mildew.",
        "In many cases, fiddle leaf fig branches remain bare as they recover from common issues.",
        "Once your plant has had plenty of time to recover, bare branches may sprout new leaves during the spring growing season.",
        "In addition, if the bare branches have any hard, brown husks, leave these along as well.",
        "These husks may be protecting new growths as your plant recovers from its issues."
