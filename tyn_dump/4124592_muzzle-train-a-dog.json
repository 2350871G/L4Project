                    "description": "There are a few different types of muzzles available on the market, but basket muzzles are the best option for most pet owners. Basket muzzles make your dog look a little bit like Hannibal Lecter, but don\u2019t let that deter you. These muzzles are the most comfortable option available and work in any situation where your dog is physically active. They are made out of wire, plastic, or leather. Wire muzzles are the most effective at preventing bites. They work particularly well on large dogs like boxers and mastiffs. Plastic and leather muzzles fit well on smaller dogs like terriers and spaniels. Many people confuse head halters with basket muzzles. Head halters are walking leads for training. Halters do not prevent dogs from biting."

This type of muzzle closes your dog\u2019s mouth, preventing them from eating, drinking, and panting. Since this is dangerous, these muzzles must only be used under close supervision for short periods of time, about 30 minutes or less. Your dog regulates its temperature by panting, so never let it wear a fabric muzzle for a long period of time, especially in warm weather or after physical activity. This type of muzzle is most commonly used by vets and groomers. It\u2019s a good option when you need to clip your dog\u2019s nails, not when you're taking your dog out for a walk. Police muzzles look like an extra secure fabric muzzle. They are made for use on police dogs trained to attack on command. This kind of muzzle is unnecessary and not recommended for pets."
