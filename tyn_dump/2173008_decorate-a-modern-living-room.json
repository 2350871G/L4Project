Choose your modern base color, then cover all of the walls of your living room. For a modern look, bright is usually the easiest to work with. Instead of choosing an antique white or a muddy gray, look for a bright white or a silver gray. To paint the walls, lay down a drop cloth to protect your floors, and use painter\u2019s tape to protect any surface from the paint. Select regular indoor paint, and pour some into a paint tray. Then, apply the paint to your walls in light, even coats using a paint roller."

        "Modern living rooms are usually well-lit, bright spaces.",
        "If you need to add some brightness to your space, go with plain, discreet floor lamps, and place 1-3 of them across your living room.",
        "Put them in dark corners or next to a reading nook, for instance.",
        "Avoid choosing decorative, bulky floor lamps.",
        "These may look great, but they aren\u2019t a modern accessory.",
        "For example, choose white, skinny, 4 ft (1.2 m) lamps and place 1 next to your TV and another next to your reading chair.",
        "If you can, consider adding recessed LED lighting to your space to keep the number of lamps to a minimum and declutter your interior.",
        "Add candles, vases, and framed pictures to fill in empty spaces.",
        "This is a great way to add some personal touches and pops of color throughout your living room.",
        "You can place candles and vases on your coffee table and end tables, and you can hang pictures and artwork on the walls.",
        "Pick items that you genuinely love, and use either neutral colors or your selected accent colors when decorating the space.",
        "For example, you can hang a black-and-white family portrait on the wall, and place vacation pictures in a sleek frame on your end table.",
        "Invest in a statement piece of artwork for a truly modern accent.",
        "Modern artwork is known by its bright colors and geometric shapes.",
        "Modern living rooms often have 1 large painting hung on the walls as a statement piece.",
        "Choose a piece of artwork that is at least 2 ft \u00d7 3 ft (0.61 m \u00d7 0.91 m) large, and hang it using secure nails or brackets.",
        "For example, choose a 4 ft \u00d7 4 ft (1.2 m \u00d7 1.2 m) canvas painting featuring multi-colored triangles or stripes.",
        "Then, hang this above your couch.",
        "You want your artwork to be a statement.",
        "If you can't find a large piece that suits your space, hang a smaller piece where it will have the most visual impact.",
        "Alternatively, choose a modern sculpture and place it on an end table or display case.",
        "This is a great idea if you aren\u2019t able to hang things from your walls.",
        "Add a vase of flowers or a potted plant for a touch of green.",
        "If you want to liven up your space, consider using a houseplant.",
        "Choose cut flowers if you want an attractive floral display, or go with a potted plant if you want a longterm option.",
        "Place your plant in the middle of your coffee table, or put it at the corner of an end table.",
        "Succulents are great for modern rooms and require minimal watering and attention.",
        "If choosing cut flowers, make sure you give them fresh water every day.",
        "Cut flowers can stay fresh in a vase for up to 1 week.",
        "If you have a potted plant, water it 1-3 times a week, based on the plant's particular needs."
