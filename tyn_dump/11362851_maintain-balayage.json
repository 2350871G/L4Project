Instead, you can wait a few months before redoing your color. If your roots begin to show or you just want it freshened up more frequently, you can visit your salon sooner or touch it up yourself at home."

Rub the toner  or purple shampoo into your hair, following the directions on the bottle for how long to leave it in before rinsing it out. Even just using a purple shampoo or toner once or twice will help turn your brassy hair color into a more ashy tone. Purchase a purple shampoo or toner from your local beauty store or online.
