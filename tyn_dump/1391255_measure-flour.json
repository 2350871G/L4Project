It\u2019s more difficult to use the proper technique with an oversized measuring cup, since you can't complete the final step of leveling off the top. So, for example, if your recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of flour, use both a one-cup dry measuring cup and a half-cup dry measuring cup. If your recipe calls for 2/3 cup of flour, measure out two 1/3 cups instead of using a larger cup."
