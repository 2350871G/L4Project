        "Start by using a paint brush to line the edges or corners of the area you are painting, such as the ceiling or railings on the deck.",

        "This will help to prevent paint drips or uneven edges or corners.",
        "Apply paint with a paint roller to the area.",
        "Use the paint roller to apply paint in a smooth motion, following the grain of the wood.",
        "Work from corner to corner, rolling the paint on to meet the corners or edges you have cut with the paintbrush.",
        "Apply a small amount of paint at a time, as you do not want the paint to clump or dry too thick.",
        "Use a paint roller that is \u20444 inch (1.9 cm) thick if the surface of the wood is rough.",
        "Apply paint with a roller that is \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) or \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) thick if the wood surface is medium rough.",
        "Use a roller that is made of foam if the wood surface is smooth, with very little rise in the grain.",

        "Put the same number of coats on every part of the deck, from the ceiling to the posts, to the floor.",
        "Paint the floor of the deck a few boards at a time, making sure you have a clear path on and off the deck so you do not paint yourself into a corner.",
        "Applying 3 coats will ensure the paint is durable and make the paint easier to maintain.",
        "Make sure you allow the paint to dry overnight between coats.",
        "Touch up any areas with a paintbrush once the paint has dried.",
        "Once the last coat of paint has dried overnight, use a paintbrush to lightly touch up any areas that are uneven or patchy.",
        "Make sure the deck color looks uniform and even.",
        "You can then enjoy your new deck for years to come, as the paint will help the wood stay dry and protect it from fading or damage."
