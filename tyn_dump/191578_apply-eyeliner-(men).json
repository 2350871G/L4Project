                    "description": "The most common method for applying eyeliner is by using an eyeliner pencil. These pencils have soft, malleable points that draw on smoothly and have a rich, dark, creamy color. Eyeliner pencils are easy to come by and can be purchased in most drug stores or supermarkets in the personal hygiene section. They come in multiple colors and shades, but black is standard and is the most masculine. Using a pencil will allow you to draw on more precise lines and contours. Remember, your pencil tip should be firm enough that it doesn't crumble on you, but soft enough that the eyeliner still glides on smoothly. Run the tip of a new eyeliner pencil over the soft part of your palm a few times before you begin applying it to your eyelid. This will blunt the tip somewhat so that it doesn\u2019t poke or scratch."

                    "headline": "Try liquid eyeliner.",
                    "description": "Rather than a soft pencil-lead type point, liquid eyeliners go on wet using a thin brush tip that lets you trace precise lines, then dries around the eye. A liquid eyeliner can make darker, sharper, and more dramatic lines. It's difficult to make liquid lines look even, though, so you may want to practice with it for awhile before wearing it out. It can be tough to draw on thin, straight lines using a liquid eyeliner, but one advantage of a liquid and brush combination is that it lends itself to creating a much more fluid coat around the eye."

Load the brush with the shadow, then draw on your line just as you would with a liquid or gel product. Eyeshadow is more forgiving, especially for beginners, and can create a softer edge. Black eyeshadow will work for this, but other colors can give you different effects. A gray shadow will give the same sultry look while being a little less harsh, while brown might look a bit more natural. Experiment to find what works for you."

                    "description": "An angle brush, chisel brush, or any similar thin, soft cosmetic brush can be used to soften the edges of the eyeliner after it\u2019s been applied. A simple cotton swab will also do, although the fluffy texture of the cotton might smear the eyeliner too much and make a mess. While not a necessity, a makeup brush or cotton swab can soften lines for a more natural contour around the eye for those who don\u2019t want that hard-edged look. Small sweeps of a makeup brush will blend the hard edges of the eyeliner. Cotton swabs with pointed tips are better than rounded ones for blending out your eyeliner."
