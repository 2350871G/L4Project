Cut around the outer rim of the cone as well as by the base, near the dust cover, using a utility knife. Cut around the edge of the spider and remove it. The spider is the piece that sits on the magnet. It is often a dark yellow color. Remove the lead wires from the terminal. Apply heat from a soldering iron to remove them entirely, then clean the terminal using the soldering iron. To do this, hold the hot soldering to the terminal. The remaining solder should melt and stick the tip of the soldering iron. Carefully remove the dust cover, which you should be able to lift right out."

Carefully place the cone in the gap and apply a small amount of pressure. Insert shims into the air gap in the voice coil to center the speaker. Space each shim around the whole gap to assure consistency. This step is very important. The speaker has to be centered correctly for it to function. Attach the gasket.
