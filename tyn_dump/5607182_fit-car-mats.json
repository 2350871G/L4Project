        "Most mats will simply lie directly over the floor in front of the seats.",
        "Some will need to be fitted onto factory retention posts.",
        "These posts are hooks or rods located at the center or around the perimeter of your floor in front of the seat, with corresponding latch spots.",
        "Secure these latching spots over the retention posts, snapping them in place.",
        "Make sure that the gripping or non-skid side of the mat faces down as you install it.",
        "Check the fit.",
        "Check the mat placement along the pedals and seat base to make sure that the mats do not obstruct any part of them.",
        "Try to adjust the seats back and forth, sliding them along the track rails.",
        "Work around the perimeter of each car mat, pressing it down in place until it is flat against your floorboard and feels secure.",
        "Make sure that the mat does not interfere with the smooth operation of the gas and brake pedal."
