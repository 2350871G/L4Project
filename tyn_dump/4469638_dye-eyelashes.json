There are also color-tinted options, like blue or bright red. Most of these color tints are not especially noticeable, but they can create a more cohesive appearance with dyed hair. There are a few different types for you to choose from, just like hair dye. Vegetable dyes, like henna, are the most commonly used, since eyelashes are a sensitive area. You may be able to find chemical-based dyes for eyelashes, but you should use caution when using them. You are most likely to find eyelash dye at beauty supply stores and online, since it is considered a specialty product. Never use standard hair dyes when dealing with your eyelashes, as they contain chemicals that are dangerous to apply near your eyes. Instead, look for a dye specifically formulated for use with lashes and brows."

Apply the dye to the skin behind your ear, inside the elbow, or anywhere relatively hidden from view. Let the dye remain on your skin for 30 minutes before washing it off. Monitor the spot for 8 to 24 hours before proceeding. If the test spot begins to itch, burn, or become inflamed, you are likely having an allergic reaction to the dye and should not use the dye on your eyelashes. It is important to do this before mixing the rest of the dye, because prepared dye may spoil if you wait a full 24 hours."
