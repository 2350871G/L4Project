Look online or at your local hunting or sporting goods store to find a hang-on or lock-on tree stand that you can comfortably sit on and carry. Some other options for concealed, sit and stalk hunting include box blinds, ladder stands, and climbing stands. However, they will all be much louder to set up, or less adaptable than a simple hang-stand. You will normally be able to get a reliable hang-on stand for between $100 to $200 USD. If you want something a little bit more sizeable or comfortable, stands designed for more people or more comfort can be purchased for a little more money."

Ask other hunters, look online, or consult maps of the local area to find a spot where you'll be able to hunt.

        "Once you've chosen your tree, move any leaves or brush that might give away your location so that you can stay as quiet as possible.",
        "If possible, you should also try to stay downwind from the animal trails to stop your scent from giving away your presence.",
        "Climbing the Tree Strap all but 2 of your climbing sticks to your harness.",
        "While you can attach ropes to your climbing sticks to pull them up to you as needed, they will be much easier to access if they are on your person.",
        "Hook the sticks through a spare hoop on your harness, or use the ratchet straps on the sticks to keep them within reach while climbing.",
        "As the first 2 climbing sticks you attach to the tree will be very close to the ground, you don't need to strap them to yourself.",
        "If you have extra room on your harness, you can attach them to make the process slightly easier.",
        "Tie a rope to your tree stand.",
        "Find a piece of rope that is at least the same length as the height you want to hang your tree stand.",
        "Tie one end to the stand and attach the other to your harness.",
        "Place the stand in an open area beneath the tree, so that you can easily pull it up when you're ready to hang it.",
        "While you can attach the stand to your harness and climb up with it, it's much easier and safer to pull it up once you're in the right position.",
        "If you slip and fall, landing or hitting your head on the tree stand can be very painful and dangerous.",
        "You can use the same technique for anything else you may need to pull up to your hang stand, such as any hunting equipment you don't want to carry up with you.",
        "Place the first climbing stick 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) off the ground.",
        "Press the climbing stick against the face of the tree, so the foot stand is facing towards you and is 2 to 3 feet (0.61 to 0.91 m) off the ground.",
        "Wrap an attached ratchet strap around the trunk of the tree, connecting the other end of the strap to the opposite side of the stand.",
        "Tighten the strap until it sits securely against the tree.",
        "Push down on the climbing stick to make sure it is positioned properly.",
        "This will stop it from moving as you climb up to it.",
        "Some climbing sticks may have foot stands or ladder portions which need to be locked into place for the stand to work, or they may be secured to the tree differently.",
        "Always read and consult the manufacturer's instructions and safety guidelines on your own climbing sticks before using them.",
        "Clip yourself to the tree with a rope.",
        "When climbing a tree to hang a stand, there is always a chance that you'll misstep and fall from the sticks.",
        "To prevent yourself from falling too far, attach a carabiner to each end of a piece of rope roughly the same length as the tree's circumference.",
        "Wrap the rope around the tree, clipping the carabiners to each side of your harness.",
        "If you slip and fall, the rope will catch on the bark of the tree and keep you suspended in the air until you can find your footing on a climbing stick.",
        "Use a double bowline knot or another climbing knot to tie the carabiners to your rope.",
        "You'll need to move the rope up the tree as you climb it.",
        "Lean into the tree and shimmy the rope upward so that it is always horizontal to the points where it as attached.",
        "Set up your second climbing stick 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 m) above the first.",
        "Stand on your first climbing stick, leaning back on the safety rope slightly.",
        "Place the second stick against the face of the tree, roughly 4 or 5 feet (1.2 or 1.5 m) above the first stick, and secure it to the tree with the attached strap.",
        "Make sure you can comfortably climb from one climbing stick to the next when choosing the placement of each one.",
        "If you have longer legs, you may be able to put them further apart.",
        "Move up to the next stick and repeat the process.",
        "Climb up the tree to stand on the second climbing stick, moving the safety rope up with you.",
        "Repeat the same process of finding a place for the climbing stick, securing it, and climbing up further until you run out of climbing sticks, or are at a comfortable height to hang your tree stand.",
        "You shouldn't need to climb more than 20 feet (6.1 m) or so up a tree to hang a stand.",
        "This will be high enough to keep you hidden, without being so high that making a shot becomes difficult.",
        "Setting up the Tree Stand Pull your tree stand up towards you.",
        "Once you are standing on a climbing stick at the right height, you will need to bring the tree stand up so that you can hang it.",
        "Pull on the rope attached to your stand slowly and steadily to avoid making loud noises that may scare off nearby animals.",
        "Avoid sliding the tree stand up the side of your tree to pull it up.",
        "As well as making a lot of noise, this may knock your climbing sticks around and make them more difficult to reach.",
        "If you strapped the climbing stand to your back, you can simply take it off to access it.",
        "Make sure you hold onto it tightly, as dropping it will be very noisy and mean you have to climb down the tree to go get it.",
        "Wrap the stand's rope around the tree and tighten it.",
        "Press the back of the tree stand against the face of the tree, just below your topmost climbing stick.",
        "Wrap the rope or ratchet strap around the trunk of the tree.",
        "Attach it to the other side of the tree stand and tighten it to keep it in place.",
        "Make sure your safety rope is above the tree stand at all times.",
        "If the stand falls while you are using it, your safety rope will only work properly if it is above the tree stand.",
        "For extra safety, attach a secondary rope to a strong branch above your tree stand.",
        "Push down on the stand to keep it in place.",
        "Once your tree stand has been tightened and secured in place, firmly grasp a solid point on the tree stand.",
        "While standing on the highest climbing stick, push down on the tree stand until it cannot move any further.",
        "This will stop the tree stand from moving around as you step onto it for the first time.",
        "Most tree stands will have a metal post that sits against the face of the tree.",
        "This is a great point to grab in order to push the stand into place.",
        "Fold the tree stand out into a platform.",
        "Most tree stands will have 2 different sections which need to be folded down to make the stand functional.",
        "Fold out the metal base of the tree stand first, giving you a platform to stand on and rest your feet on.",
        "This should reveal a seat, which you can fold down to sit on and begin looking for an animal to hunt.",
        "Check the manufacturer's instructions on how to fold out your tree stand if you're unsure of the right way to do it.",
        "Sit on the tree stand to hunt.",
        "Climb down onto the hang-on stand from above, standing on the fold-out platform before sitting down.",
        "Once you're in a comfortable position, pull up your bow, rifle, or any other hunting equipment you need.",
        "Stay quiet and wait for an animal to approach that you can line up a shot on.",
        "Hang and hunt set-ups take a good amount of patience, but let you sit in place rather than stalking your prey.",
        "Don't lose hope if you don't see any animals for a few hours after setting up.",
        "As long as you're in a populated area, it should just be a matter of time.",
        "Avoid dragging your hunting equipment up the side of the tree when pulling it up.",
        "This will make a lot of noise and may damage your equipment."
