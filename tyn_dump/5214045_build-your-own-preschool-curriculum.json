Another way to plan a curriculum for preschoolers is to take a calendar and write down the main objects that you are going to teach each week. Make sure that it covers what children need to learn for Kindergarten and that it is practical information and objects. Ask yourself: \"Why do children need to learn this?\" and \"How will this help them in life?\" Look at the following lists of objects to teach children. This is a great list to stick to, though there may be other things that you find that children should learn.
