A Dutch oven used on a fire may have a lot of soot, so take care with your hands, surfaces, and clothing. If you need to use soap, use just a little, mild dish soap, and rinse well. (If you do not, the taste of soap may stay in the cast iron seasoning and take a long time to get out...yuck!) Steel wool will work well, but may cause some areas to discolor. Only use power-abrasives such as polishing power tools for Dutch ovens in extremely bad shape."
