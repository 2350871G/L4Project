                    "description": "Fish are very sensitive to the pH in their water and can die if the water becomes too acidic or too basic. Most species of fish thrive in relatively neutral water, close to 7 on the pH scale. If the water has become too basic, add peat moss to lower the pH. If the water is too acidic, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of baking soda per every 5 gallons (19 L) of water to raise the pH. Look online or visit a local pet store to find out the specific water-level pH needs of the breeds of fish you have. For example, if you\u2019re keeping koi fish, they prefer basic water with a pH range between 7.5 and 8.2. You can purchase clumps of peat at your local pet store. Put 1 clump of peat into a mesh bag, and place this inside of your fish tank\u2019s water filter. The peat will lower the acid level over time. Rapid changes in pH can have a harmful effect on your fish. Remove the fish from your tank before adjusting the pH. Test the pH level in your fish tank both before and after making an adjustment. Also test pH before and after altering pH levels in pools or drinking water, as per the relevant section of this article."

If you\u2019ve measured your tap water and found that it\u2019s basic (or too acidic), you\u2019ll need to adjust the water\u2019s pH level before watering your plants. Lime or wood ash can be added to a 1 gallon (3.8 L) container of water to raise the pH. To lower the pH, add phosphoric acid or a tablet designed to lower water pH. If you\u2019re unsure about the ideal pH level for the specific type of plant you\u2019re watering, check online or at a local plant nursery. Some plants are very pH sensitive and need water at an exact pH level. For example, onions thrive when given more basic water at a pH of 6.5-7.0. Consult your local plant nursery to determine the exact amount of pH-altering substances to add. You can also buy lime, wood, ash, and phosphoric acid or other pH-lowering substances at the nursery. If you repeatedly water plants with water outside of the 5.5\u20136.5 range, they will begin to wither and die."

        "Litmus strips are a quick and effective gauge of pH levels, but are not the most precise method of measurement.",
        "A digital probe reader (often called a \u201cpH meter\u201d) is a much more accurate device, which will determine the pH of a liquid to 2 decimal places.",
        "To use the pH meter, submerge the tip of the instrument in water until the display shows the pH reading.",
        "pH meters are commonly used in science labs and can be purchased or rented through science-supply stores.",
        "The pH meter may need to be re-calibrated between each usage.",
        "Follow the printed directions included with the meter for best results."
