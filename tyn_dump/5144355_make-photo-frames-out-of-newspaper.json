Take a half of the newspaper and divide it into another half so that when you roll them, it won't become too big!  Use a dowel or broom stick to roll the paper up into a tube. Once rolled, glue it so that it doesn't come apart. You can either make it thin by pulling the rolls close together or make it wide by not keeping it firm. Make sure all the rolls are equal as they only look good when the same size. Make 8 rolls in total. This will be sufficient for all four sides of the photo frame. Make 4 notebook paper rolls. Use the notebook paper to make rolls by following the same rolling steps. Attach the rolls to the photo frame Glue the drawing or picture to the cardboard backing.  Add the paper rolls to the image. Arrange these carefully as a border around the picture. Glue in place. Trim off any remaining cardboard if it's showing.  Cover any holes between the rolls by sticking flowers (plastic or paper) over the top. Or, spread glitter or glitter glue in a interesting pattern. Done. Make sure the drawing (if it is one) is sparkling and beautiful because the picture is more important than the frame.",
