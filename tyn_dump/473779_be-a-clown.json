You can start off with the traditional tools and become more original as you discover who your inner clown really is.

The expensive items can come later, once you are more established, so don't worry about those for now. You'll need a clown costume along with a pair of big, floppy shoes.

Contrary to popular belief, not all clowns wear face paint. Clowning is a style of comedy, not a style of makeup. Most clowns use greasepaint for their faces, since this kind doesn't wash off as easily as water-based paint or Halloween paint. If you do put on makeup, there are a variety of makeup styles you can try:\nWhiteface clown paint. This is the traditional face paint that you may think of when you want to look like a clown. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/fc\\/Be-a-Clown-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Be-a-Clown-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/fc\\/Be-a-Clown-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Be-a-Clown-Step-3Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nAuguste clown paint.

Most clowns work for themselves, but some of them are part of a duo, a trio, or even an entertainment company. If you want a sidekick, or if you want to be a sidekick, then see if you can find a clown friend to buddy up with. If you do, think about performance partner and what your relationships are to the audience. Thinking about status may be a good start. Plan your show. Get an idea for major comedy points you want to include, and work out the lead-up and other parts of the comedy. Thinking about problems that need addressing can be a good start e.g a hat that won't stay on your head , or a music stand that keeps falling over. A twist at the end may help, as can thinking about the rule of three (e.g mistake, mistake, success) in an unexpected way. It's almost like a play. If you're so minded, script your act before rehearsal!

If you want to be more of a magician-clown, then you'll need to work on learning some easy magic tricks and work your way up to being a magician all-star. Check out the variety of Magic articles on wikiHow, or take a course in magician training, if you're really serious about this aspect of the job. Just remember that if you want to be a magician clown, you'll need more props, such as a top hat, wand, flashy handkerchief, and so on, and it could get costly. Work on your Slapstick skills. If you want to use slapstick - practice - there is almost nothing less funny than slapstick done badly. The best comedy will try to emulate some real life, such as talking about bosses, home life, and other things people can connect with. try to include jokes about things the likely audience will understand and appreciate! Avoid clown clich\u00e9s. There is nothing a clown has to do. Unless you have a twist on the obvious, you should try to avoid the most obvious clowning tricks if you want to be successful.

Once you have your act together, you've scripted it and acquired the necessary tools, start practising. An ability to time the jokes just right, and the ability to make a smooth recovery if something goes wrong, is essential. First, try your act on your own and tape yourself to see how you can improve. Then, work your moves on a trusted friend. Open it up to your family or small group of children and see how you do. Finding Work Decide what kind of clown you want to be. Before you can go off and try to find work, you need to figure out what type of clowning is best for your personality. This can determine how you alter your routine and what kind of clients you will work with. For example, you will do different tricks depending on whether you're working with hospital patients, children, or adults. You can do multiple kinds of clowning, of course, but you should always keep your audience in mind before you perform. Here are some places where you can work:\nChildren's parties\nAdult parties\nChildren's hospitals\nCircuses Go to clown school. Clown school used to be more popular, such as the Barnum and Bailey's clown school that was a big hit until the mid-90s, but you can still find some classes to take if you want to improve as a clown. Barnum and Baileys, for example, still offers a one-year clown school if you make the cut, though it does not have a permanent location. Go to clown conferences and camps. If you don't have time for clown school or if there aren't any clown schools in your area, you can still go to clown conventions to learn some tricks and moves from the great masters. The Clowns of America International web site, for example, advertises a clown camp in Orlando in 2014. Going to conventions is a great way to meet other clowns and to improve your skills. Learn the tricks of the trade from other clowns. The CAI website also offers information about Clown Alleys, or places where you can find and learn from groups of other clowns. You can contact these clowns and ask if they wouldn't mind having a student. The best way to learn, really, is to find a clown mentor that is right for you. Remember that, just because a clown is great doesn't mean that he or she is interested in the same kind of clowning that tickles your fancy. Advertise like a professional. If you want to make this a business, try to get some advertisements up around your local area. Contact your local newspaper and local venues to see if you can pay to put up posters and adverts. To really make it as a clown, you'll have to understand marketing and advertising techniques, especially on a local basis, to improve your chances of booking gigs and actually making a profit. Start small. Work a children's birthday party. See if a hospital needs a clown to fill a shift. Clown around at one of your friend's parties. Even working for a small audience will help you get your feet wet and to know what people do and do not like. This will also give you the experience to learn what to do for larger audiences, and to gain the confidence you need to truly succeed as a clown. This is how you will begin to build a following. Even if you've only impressed the friend of a friend, that person may be able to get you your next gig. Succeeding in Your Career Consider joining a clown group or a union. These groups or unions will give you more support, knowledge, and credibility and they are a great thing to add to your CV. If you know local clowns, ask them about alleys in your area, which can help you gain skills and network. On the national and international level, check out some of these prestigious organizations:\nClowns of America International\nWorld Clown Association\nClowns Canada\nClowns International Continue to improve your skills. Hopefully by now you have put together an act, started on the ladder to stardom, and (if you're really committed) have made some cash as well. With show business, the sky really is the limit! Keep working on juggling, acting, telling stories, doing magic tricks, or whatever it is that makes your show special. Don't get complacent. There is always room for improvement. Continue to improve your engagement with the audience. If you want to be the best clown ever, then you have to be able to know what your audience wants and how to give it to them. Here are some things you will have to work on to succeed in your career:\nUnderstanding of audience expectation of your performance's quality and authenticity\nAbility to speak in public without fear\nAbility to make children feel comfortable\nPerforming in a way that ensures the safety of your audience Consider auditioning for a circus. If you want to be a circus clown, then you have to build up years of experience first. But if this is the route you want to take, then you have to apply to be a clown in the circus just as you would in any other job application; you'll need to include your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, videos of your tricks, and to audition for the role if you are asked to do so. Auditioning for a circus, such as Cirque du Soleil or Barnum and Bailey's, is considered the big leagues of clowndom. Don't get discouraged if it doesn't work out right away. If you're curious about what you need to apply to be a circus clown, check out some applications online.
