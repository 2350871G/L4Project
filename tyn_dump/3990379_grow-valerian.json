If valerian grows naturally in your area, you can usually find a number of young plants sprouting in the spring. Dig up the root system and plant it in your garden after the last frost.

Soak it every few days when you are not receiving regular rain. Harvesting Valerian Cut the blooms of the valerian plant to use for bouquets. This keeps the plant from going to seed and spreading too far. It can also make the roots more potent if you are harvesting them for a sleep aid. Use a sharp pair of shears and cut near the base of the stem. Valerian starts blooming early in the spring. You may get two or three blooms, depending upon the placement of the plant and its age.
