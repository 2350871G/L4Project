Use this method if you're short on time and need to reheat them quickly. Defrost the tamales. Keep the tamales in the refrigerator for one day if they are frozen.

Lower the tamales slowly into the deep fryer. Use metal tongs to slowly submerge the tamales into the deep fryer oil. Do not drop the tamales into the deep fryer or the oil will splash back and could burn you. Be careful not to touch the hot deep fryer or oil. Cook the tamales for two to three minutes. Let the tamales fry in the deep fryer for 2-3 minutes. At the end of the cook, the tamales should be golden brown with a nice fried coating. Remove the tamales from the oil and let them cool.
