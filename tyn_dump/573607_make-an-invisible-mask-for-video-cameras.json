            "description": "Make sure your wires are long enough (around 15cm / 6 in each) depending on how big your hat is. Start wiring up the LEDs one by one, making sure to note the positive and negative terminals. (Color-coding the wires is highly recommended: for example, you can use a white wire for each positive terminal and a color wires for each negative terminal.) Wrap the wires tightly to each LED so they won't fall apart. You can even solder the connections, though it's probably not necessary."

Think this out and position them well. Mark each spot with a marker, then cut a few holes with a pair of small scissors in the middle of the front of the hat as well as a few on the sides."
