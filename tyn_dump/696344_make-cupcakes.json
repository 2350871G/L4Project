Combine 1 3/4 cups of cake flour (not self-rising), 1 1/4 cups of unbleached all-purpose flour, 2 cups of sugar, and 1 tsp. of baking powder together in a bowl. Mix the ingredients until they're combined, for about 3 minutes. Add 4 sticks of unsalted cubed butter to the mixture. Mix it in until the butter is just coated with flour. Add 4 large eggs to the mixture, one at a time. Add the eggs one by one until each egg is incorporated into the mixture. Add 1 cup of whole milk and 1 tsp. of pure vanilla extract to the batter. Mix the ingredients together until they're completely mixed, taking the time to scrape down the bowl so no ingredients are stuck. Fill each baking cup 2/3 full with the batter. This will give the cupcakes enough room to expand. Bake for 17-20 minutes. After 15 minutes, start inserting a toothpick into the cupcakes. Once it comes out clean, the cupcakes are done and should be taken out of the oven. Check back every 2 minutes until they're ready. Make the frosting. You can do this while the cupcakes are cooking. To make the frosting, just cream 2 sticks of softened butter, 3 cups of confectioners' sugar, 1/2 cup of milk, and 2 tsp. of vanilla extract together. Beat the mixture with a paddle until it's smooth and gradually add the other 3 cups of sugar until it's rich and creamy. Cool the cupcakes.

Then, remove the cupcakes from the tins and leave them to cool on wire racks. Make the marshmallow filling. You can do this while the cupcakes are baking. Microwave 3 tbsp. of unsalted butter in a microwave-safe covered bowl. Then, stir in 1 1/2 7-oz. jars of marshmallow cream to the butter. Then, microwave the cr\u00e8me and butter for 1 more minute. Cool this mixture for 2 minutes and then beat it with an electric mixer for at least 1 minute, until it's nice and smooth. Make a 1/2-inch slit in the bottom center of each cupcake. Spoon the marshmallow filling into a pastry bag fitted with a round tip. Pipe the filling into the slits in the cupcake. Combine 2/3 cup of heavy cream and 1 tbsp. of light corn syrup in a small saucepan. Cook the ingredients over medium heat until they're boiling. Then, pour 1 10-oz. bag of dark chocolate chips into the mixture and stir it until it's completely smooth. Let the mixture cool until it thickens, for 4-5 minutes. Dip the cupcake tops into the chocolate mixture. Smooth out the tops with a knife if necessary. Then, place the cupcakes into another paper liner and let the chocolate harden a bit. Spoon the vanilla frosting into a pastry bag. This bag should have a small round tip. Pipe a line of small loops around the center of each cake -- the loops should all intersect a bit. Then wait a few minutes for the chocolate mixture to set. Serve. Enjoy these tasty treats on their own or with a glass of milk. Tiramisu Cupcakes Preheat your oven to 325\u00baF (162\u00baC).  Line standard muffin tins with paper liners.  Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, and salt. Sift 1 1/4 cups of sifted cake flour (not self-rising), 3/4 tsp. of baking powder, and 1/2 tsp. of coarse salt. Halve one vanilla bean lengthwise. Scrape out the seeds and save them. Heat 1/4 cup milk and vanilla-bean pod and seeds in a small saucepan over medium heat. Heat it just until bubbles appear around the edge. Then, remove it from heat. Whisk in 4 tbsp. of unsalted butter until it's melted. Then, let the mixture stand for 15 minutes to thicken. Strain the milk mixture through a sieve into a bowl. Discard the vanilla-bean pod. Whisk together the whole eggs, yolks, and sugar. Use an electric mixer set on medium to whisk together 3 whole eggs, 3 egg yolks, and 1 cup of granulated sugar. Place the mixing bowl over a pan of simmering water. Whisk the ingredients by hand until the sugar is dissolved and the mixture is warm. This should take about 5-6 minutes. Then, remove the bowl from heat. Whisk the mixture with an electric mixer on high heat. Continue to whisk it until the mixture is pale yellow, fluffy, and thick enough to hold a ribbon on the surface for a few seconds when the whisk is lifted. Fold the flour mixture into the egg mixture in three batches. First, stir 1/2 cup of the batter into the milk mixture to thicken it, then fold the milk mixture into the rest of the batter until you've just combined all of the ingredients. Fill each cup 2/3 full with the batter. This will give the cupcakes enough room to expand. Distribute the batter evenly among the cups. Bake the cupcakes for 20 minutes. Rotate the tins halfway through. Continue to cook the cupcakes until the centers are solid -- you can test them by sticking a toothpick in the center of the cupcakes -- and the edges of the cupcakes are light golden brown. Then, transfer the tins to wire racks to cool the cupcakes completely. Make the syrup. To make the syrup, stir together 1/3 cup of very strong coffee, 1 oz. of marsala wine, and 1/4 cup of granulated sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Let this syrup cool. Brush the tops of the cupcakes with the syrup. Continue to do this until you've used all of the syrup. Let the cupcakes stand to absorb the liquid for 30 minutes. Make the frosting. Set an electric mixer on medium speak and whisk together 1 cup of heavy cream. Whisk together 8 oz. of mascarpone cheese and 1/2 cup of sifted confectioners' sugar until the mixture is smooth. Then, fold the whipped heavy cream into the cheese mixture until it's blended. Dollop the frosting onto the cupcakes. Refrigerate the cupcakes overnight in airtight containers to settle them. Serve. Dust these tasty treats with cocoa powder and enjoy them at any time. Five-Ingredients Cupcakes Gather your ingredients.  Preheat your oven to 350\u00baF (176\u00baC).  Put in your butter and sugar. Mix until fluffy and well stuck together. You may want to start with a wooden spoon because butter gets stuck to the hand mixer very easily. Pour in your eggs in small portions and mix every time you pour them in. The batter should get a little more runny than before. Put in the flour mixed with baking powder in small portions and mix. When you're done the batter will get chunky. Don't worry about that, just make it a little more soft by mixing it on a faster speed. Put the prepared batter in small sized cupcake shells and leave it to bake in the pre-heated oven for around 20-25 minutes.  Spread icing or frosting over the cupcakes and serve.
