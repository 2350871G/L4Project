Move any items far enough that they won\u2019t get in your way while you\u2019re working. Make sure there\u2019s a clear path to the storm shelter area and it can be accessed quickly. Calculate 7 square feet (0.65 m) for each person. FEMA recommendations state that there needs to be enough floor space for each person to occupy the shelter for the duration of the tornado or hurricane. Count each person that you believe may need to use the shelter in an emergency and multiply that by 7 square feet (0.65 m) to find the total area your shelter needs to cover. For example, if you have a family of 4 people, then you would need a space that covers an area of 28 square feet (2.6 m).

Constructing the Frame Measure and cut 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) boards the lengths of your walls. Take 2 by 6 in (5.1 by 15.2 cm) boards, measure the length of your walls and mark the measurements on the boards with a pencil or marker. Then, use a circular saw to cut the boards to size. You can also measure your walls and purchase pre-cut boards that fit your measurements. Ask an employee at the hardware or home improvement store that you purchase your boards from to cut them to size for you. Drill 5.5 in (14 cm) holes in the boards and concrete with a hammer drill. A hammer drill is a powerful tool that will allow you to drill into the concrete foundation. Drill holes spaced out about 12 inches (30 cm) apart through both of the boards and into the concrete beneath them. The holes will be needed so you can attach the anchor bolts. Start the drill slowly and bring it up to full speed to drive through the boards and into the foundation. You can rent hammer drills from home improvement stores.Warning: Use eye and ear protection when operating the hammer drill to avoid damaging your hearing and getting concrete particles in your eyes.

Install a double layer of the boards spaced out 12 inches (30 cm) using 6 in (15 cm) wood screws. Install at least 2 screws for each end of the stud. Secure the studs to the ceiling with hurricane ties. Hurricane ties are metal fasteners that are secured to wall studs to allow them to resist the force of hurricane-strength winds.

Drive the screws through the sheet and into the wooden studs. You can find 14-gauge steel sheets at roofing supply stores, at home improvement stores, and online.
