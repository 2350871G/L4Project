                    "description": "Solid hardwoods have been the traditionally used material in flooring for some time now. They will give a room an elegant, old-world look and for good reason: solid hardwood floors last a long time. They can be sanded and refinished many times, giving them a much longer lifespan than other types of wood flooring. However, considerations must be made as hardwoods are very susceptible to changes in moisture level. Solid hardwood floors can only be placed in specific areas, because of their reactions to moisture. They cannot be used in bathrooms or in basements. Prepare accordingly. Floors like these will also need installation considerations. Solid hardwoods will need to be nailed into place, which means that a wood subfloor is required. If you do not or cannot provide this, you will need to consider other options."
