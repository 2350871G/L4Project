Wrap the roast tightly in plastic wrap, then secure it, Place it in a large bowl or on a large plate in the refrigerator overnight. Salting the roast ahead of time gives the salt more time to soak into the meat. As a result, the sirloin tip roast will be more flavorful, and the flavor will be evenly dispersed. Make sure the roast is thawed, or at least thawed enough for the salt to stick."

        "Combine the chili powder, black pepper, and garlic powder.",

        "Cover the grill and cook for 1 hour.",
        "Stick a meat thermometer into the center of the sirloin tip roast to test its internal temperature.",
        "At this stage, it should be 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).",
        "Monitor the temperature of the grill as the meat cooks to make sure it stays relatively consistent.",
        "Brush with barbecue sauce and continue grilling.",
        "Use a basting brush to evenly apply 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the barbecue sauce over all sides of the roast.",

        "Allow it to stand for 10 minutes.",

        "Note that you do not need to add any liquid to this recipe, even though liquid is recommended for most slow cooker recipes.",
        "The meat and vegetables should give off enough liquid to prevent the roast from drying out during the cooking process.",
        "If, however, you want the meat to be even more moist, you can add 1/2 to 1 cup (125 to 250 ml) of water or beef broth to the contents of the slow cooker, as well.",
        "Cook on high for 2 hours.",
        "Cover the slow cooker and cook the contents for 2 hours on high heat.",
        "Cook on low for 4 to 6 hours.",
        "After the first 2 hours, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 6 hours.",
        "If you will not be home and able to switch the heat, you could simply cook the roast on low for 8 hours, instead.",

        "Add the cubed tip sirloin roast to the hot oil in the pressure cooker a little at a time.",
        "Cook, stirring frequently, until all sides have browned.",

        "It will also take 15 minutes for the machine to pressure up and another 20 minutes for it to release that pressure.",
        "Mix the flour and water.",
        "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and water to form a slurry.",
        "This slurry will be used as a thickener for the drippings in the pressure cooker.",
        "Without it, you would be unable to form any gravy.",
        "Add this slurry to the cooked meat and boil.",
        "Stir the flour slurry into the broth and meat in the pressure cooker pot.",
        "Select the \"browning\" setting and let the liquid reach a boil.",
        "Continue cooking at a boil for a couple of minutes, or until the liquid thickens to gravy consistency.",
