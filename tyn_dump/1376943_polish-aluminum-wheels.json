If you want to make your own aluminum wheel cleaner at home, you can try combining lemon juice and soda and using this as a cleaner. You can also wash the wheel with dawn detergent and water, and then sprinkle on baking soda to scrub. In both of these cases there is an abrasive material (soda or baking soda) which serves to scrub off grime."

Let the wheel sit for a few minutes to dry, and use a clean rag to lightly remove residual dust. Polishing the Aluminum Rub aluminum polish onto a small section of the wheel with a rag. Aluminum polish is an effective way to remove oxidation from aluminum wheels, which aren\u2019t well protected from this kind of damage. Use a clean rag to rub aluminum polish onto the wheel, working in the direction of the grain. Work in small sections so that the polish doesn\u2019t dry before you work it in.

Place a soft cloth around the toothbrush so the bristles don't mar the finish. Use the toothbrush to reach into the spoke areas and rub on polish where you could not reach on your initial sweep.

Sealing the Wheels with Wax Place a small amount of wax on a clean cloth. Wheel wax helps protect your wheels and make them look cleaner much longer. You can measure a good amount of wax by putting it on your fingertip and then transferring it to the clean cloth. You can also protect the aluminum with a metal sealant, which works like wax to protect against oxidation. Rub the wax over the entire surface of the wheel. Rub with the grain of the aluminum, as you did with the aluminum polish. Cover the entire surface of the wheel with wax, reapplying wax to your cloth as necessary. Allow the wax to dry fully, usually for about 10-15 minutes. Set a timer so you don\u2019t forget to come back. The wax will seal onto the wheels to provide a protective layer while you wait.
