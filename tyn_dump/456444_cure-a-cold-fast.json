Despite the benefits of heat, dry heat can actually irritate inflamed nasal passages and sore throats. You can combat this by using a humidifier to add moisture back into the air. This can help to make breathing more comfortable. Just be aware that humidifiers can spread pathogens and molds. Drink lots of fluids. All that nose blowing and sweating it out under heavy blankets can leave you feeling dehydrated, which can worsen cold symptoms, leading to headaches and dry, irritated throats. Try to drink slightly more than average when you're sick - whether the fluids come in the form of hots teas, soups, water-heavy fruit and veg (watermelon, tomato, cucumber, pineapple), or just plain water. A handy way to check for dehydration is to examine your urine. If it's very pale yellow or almost clear, you're doing okay. But if it's dark yellow, this means that there are higher concentrations of waste in your body that are not being diluted, which is a sign that you should drink more water. Treating Your Other Symptoms Take a pain reliever/fever reducer. If you have aches or a high temperature, your main two choices are acetaminophen (Tylenol) and NSAIDs (non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen). Avoid taking NSAIDs, if you have acid reflux or peptic ulcer disease. If you are already taking a NSAID for other issues, talk to your doctor before taking more. Do not take more than the prescribed amount, as indicated on the bottle. Too much of either medicine can lead to liver toxicity. You don't want to develop a worse condition while trying to fight off another. Gargle salt water to ease your sore throat. Congestion isn't the only nasty symptom you have to contend with during a cold - dry, itchy, or sore throats can be equally bothersome. An easy, natural way to deal with this is to gargle a salt solution. The water hydrates the throat, while the antiseptic properties in the salt help to fight infection. Make the solution by dissolving a teaspoon of salt in a glass of warm water. If the taste is too unpleasant for your liking, add a little baking soda to take the edge off the saltiness. Gargle this solution up to four times a day. Do not swallow. Take elderberry syrup. Elderberries are said to be a great natural immune booster, and are therefore very popular as a natural cold remedy. Elderberry contains flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties and may help prevent damage to the body\u2019s cells. However, very few studies have been done in humans, so researchers don't know how effective elder may be. You can use elderberries in a number of ways:\nTaking a spoonful of elderberry syrup every morning. This syrup can be found in most health food stores, or you can make your own. By adding a couple of drops of elderberry extract (also found in health food stores) to a glass of water or juice. Or by drinking elderberry tea - a hot beverage with elder flowers and peppermint leaves. Eat a spoon of raw honey. Raw honey is an effective natural immune booster, which also contains anti-viral properties and soothes sore throats making it a primary ingredient in many natural cold remedies. You can eat a spoonful of the raw honey by itself or stir it into warm water or tea. Another great cure for a cold is to have a glass of milk mixed with a spoonful of turmeric powder, then chase it down quickly with a spoonful of honey. Try to source raw honey from your local area, as it will help your body to develop a tolerance for allergens native to your region. Eat garlic. Garlic boasts an impressive array of health benefits, thanks to its antimicrobial, antiviral and antibiotic properties. There is some evidence to suggest that raw garlic can help to relieve cold symptoms, shorten a colds duration and boost the immune system, thus preventing future cold. Eating Garlic to Relieve Symptoms\nCrush up a clove and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. This allows a compound known as allicin to develop - a potent anti-bacterial agent which gives garlic most of its health benefits. Then, mix the garlic with a little honey of olive oil and spread it on a cracker, or eat it raw if you have a strong stomach. You can also take garlic as a supplement, but it\u2019s more effective when eaten raw. Take natural supplements. There are certain natural supplements which are believed to help with cold symptoms. While they won't necessarily cure the cold or stop it in its tracks, they can help it to go away faster. For example:\n\nNatural Supplements to Try:\nEchinacea, an herbal supplement believed to contain anti-viral properties and aid in the treatment of respiratory infections. When taken in tablet form it is said to reduce the span of a cold, if taken as soon as the first symptoms appear. Zinc, which has been shown to shorten the duration of colds by preventing the virus from reproducing. It can be taken in tablet, lozenge or syrup form. Ginseng, an ancient cold remedy that\u2019s been scientifically proven to help shorten the duration of colds and reinforce the immune system. It can be taken in supplement form, or the root can be boiled in water to make tea.",
