        "Use the formula: 1.0000 \u2013 (0.0044993 * IB) + (0.011774 * FB) + (0.00027581 * IB\u00b2) \u2013 (0.0012717 * FB\u00b2) \u2013 (0.0000072800 * IB\u00b3) + (0.000063293 * FB\u00b3), where IB is the corrected initial Brix measurement and FB is the corrected final Brix measurement.",
        "Simplify the equation using a calculator to find the final estimated specific gravity, which you can then use to calculate the alcohol content.",
        "Round the answer to the third decimal point.",
        "For example, if the corrected initial Brix percentage was 11.54 and the corrected final percentage was 7.69, the equation would be: 1.0000 \u2013 (0.0044993 * 11.54) + (0.011774 * 7.69) + (0.00027581 * (11.54\u00b2)) \u2013 (0.0012717 * (7.69\u00b2)) \u2013 (0.0000072800 * (11.54\u00b3)) + (0.000063293 * (7.69\u00b3)).",
        "After plugging the equation into a calculator, the final specific gravity would be 1.018.Tip: There are many online calculators on home-brewing websites where you can plug in the Brix values and immediately find the specific gravity.",

        "Round your answer to the third decimal point to find the initial specific gravity, which you can use to find the alcohol content of the wort.",
        "For example, if the first Brix percentage was 11.54, the equation would read: (11.54 / [258.6 - (11.54 / 258.2) * 227.1]) + 1.",

        "Type the equation into a calculator and round the answer to the third decimal point to find the expected alcohol content of the wort once it\u2019s completely fermented.",
        "For example, if the initial specific gravity was 1.046 and the final specific gravity was 1.018, then the equation would read:  (76.08 * [1.046 - 1.018] / [1.775 - 1.046]) * (1.018 / 0.794).",
        "After putting the formula into a calculator, your result would be 3.747, which means the drink will be 3.747% alcohol by volume, which is how much alcohol is contained in 100 millilitres (3.4  fl oz)."
