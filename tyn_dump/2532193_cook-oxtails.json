Place the oxtails in the bowl with the marinade and turn them so they're coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. Marinate the oxtails overnight so they become flavorful. The marinade will also tenderize the oxtails as they chill. Heat 2 to 3 US tbsp (30 to 44 ml) of oil in a skillet with 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar. Pour the vegetable oil into a large pot or Dutch oven and turn the burner to medium-high. Once the oil shimmers, add the sugar and stir so it dissolves. Use less of the oil if you're cooking closer to 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of oxtails. Remove the oxtails from the marinade and lay them in the skillet. Take the bowl of marinating oxtails out of the fridge and use a slotted spoon or tongs to lift the oxtails out. Transfer them to the skillet with the oil. Arrange the oxtails so they're in a single layer in the skillet. Reserve the marinade so you can add it to the pot later. Cook the oxtails for 8 to 10 minutes. Sear the meat over medium-high heat until the oxtails brown on all sides. Use tongs to turn them halfway through the cooking time so they heat evenly. Browning the meat creates a rich, deep flavor. Add the marinade, beef stock, butter beans, salt, and pepper. Pour the reserved marinade into the pot along with 4 cups (950 ml) of beef stock.

Spoon the gravy over the oxtails. Turn off the burner and ladle the gravy over the oxtails in the serving dish. Consider serving them with steamed rice or crusty bread. You can refrigerate the leftover oxtails in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Oven-Braised Oxtails Preheat the oven to 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C) and trim fat from the oxtails. Set 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of oxtails on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to carefully cut off excess fat from the oxtails. Trim off large pieces of fat, but don't cut into the meat itself. Since oxtails are fatty, there will still be fat on the tails, but removing large pieces of fat will prevent the dish from being too greasy. Place the oxtails in a roasting pan and season them with salt and pepper. Get out a roasting pan that's at least 12 by 17 inches (30 cm \u00d7 43 cm) in size. Arrange the oxtails in the pan so they're in a single layer and sprinkle a few pinches of salt and pepper over them. The salt will tenderize the meat as it initially roasts. Bake the oxtails for 30 to 40 minutes. Keep the pan uncovered and put it in the preheated oven. Roast the oxtails until they're dark brown all over. Use tongs to turn them over halfway through the cooking time. Browning the oxtails in the oven creates a rich, caramelized flavor. Remove the pan and add red wine, broth, vinegar, and herbs. Wear oven mitts to take the pan out and set it on the stove. Pour in 1 (750 ml) bottle of dry red wine, 3 cups (710 ml) of beef broth, and \u20444 cup (59 ml) of balsamic vinegar. Then, add 1 tablespoon (0.5 g) of chopped fresh rosemary leaves or 1 teaspoon (1 g) of dried rosemary, 1 tablespoon (2 g) of chopped fresh tarragon or 1 teaspoon (1.5 g) of dried tarragon, and 1 tablespoon (2.5 g) of chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon (1.5 g) of dried thyme.Variation: If you'd like to braise vegetables with the oxtails, add 1 onion chopped into 2 in (5.1 cm) pieces, 5 roughly chopped shallots, 2 carrots chopped into 2 in (5.1 cm) pieces, and 2 stalks of celery chopped into 2 in (5.1 cm) pieces. For a dry red wine, you could use Cabernet Sauvignon, Sangiovese, or Pinot Noir. Stir the mixture and cover the pan with foil. Stir the bottom of the roasting pan with a wooden spoon so you scrape up the flavorful browned bits. These add flavor to the dish. Then, cover the pan tightly with a sheet of aluminum foil. Turn the oven down to 325 \u00b0F (163 \u00b0C) and put the pan back in the oven. Reduce the oven temperature and place the covered pan of oxtails in the oven. It's important to keep the pan tightly covered so the liquid doesn't evaporate as the oxtails braise. Bake the oxtails for 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 hours. Cook the oxtails until they're completely tender when you poke them with a fork. Once they're cooked, carefully remove the pan from the oven and serve the oxtails with roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes. Refrigerate leftover oxtails in an airtight container for up to 4 days. The oxtails will become more tender the longer they're stored. Slow-Cooker Jamaican Oxtails Trim the excess fat from 2 pounds (910 g) of oxtails. Put the oxtails on a cutting board and carefully cut away large pieces of fat that are visible on the sides of the meat. Discard this excess fat. There will still be a little fat left on the oxtails because they're a fatty piece of beef. A little fat gives the dish flavor. Coat the oxtails with salt, pepper, creole seasoning, and flour. Scatter 1 \u00bd teaspoons (8 g) of salt, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground black pepper, 2 teaspoons of (4 g) of creole seasoning, and 3 tablespoons (36 g) of flour over the oxtails. Then, turn them over and rub them over the cutting board so they pick up seasoning that's fallen on the board. The flour helps the liquid thicken as it cooks. Heat the oil in a skillet and brown the oxtails for 8 to 10 minutes. Pour 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vegetable oil into a skillet and turn the burner to medium-high. Once the oil shimmers, slowly lower the oxtails into the pan. Cook them until they're a rich brown color on both sides. Use tongs to carefully flip them over halfway through the cooking time. If you're short on prep time, you can skip this step, but the meat may not be as flavorful. Cut the onion, carrots, ginger, and garlic. Cut 1 onion into \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices. Then, chop 2 carrots into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Thinly slice 3 cloves of garlic and a 1 \u20442 in (3.8 cm) piece of ginger. Slice the garlic and ginger as thinly as you can. Put all of the ingredients into a slow cooker and stir them well. Transfer all of the ingredients you just chopped to a slow cooker and add the seared oxtails.
