Asking permission from the owner of the field or woodland is advised because taking straw, grains or cornstalks without permission is stealing. For a more durable broom that is less likely to fall apart, it is also advised to use real \"broom straw\" a variety of the Sorghum plant, and that variety is called Sorghum vulgare var. technicum."
