Since you'll be trying to photograph moving subjects, a DSLR camera is the best option. Choose a DSLR camera that's a size you can easily carry and that has a wide variety of ISO settings.

The camera will automatically focus as you take each picture, leaving you free to capture as many images as possible in a shorter amount of time.

A shutter speed of at least 1/500 is necessary to capture movement, and 1/1000 is even more ideal. A fast shutter speed will freeze the dancer's action, giving your photo clarity."

Instead of one picture of a dancer jumping, you'll get a large group of photos of the jump, allowing you to choose which one is best. For example, turn on burst mode when you're shooting dance portraits, or when dancers are performing a lift."
