Likewise, you might get warm and want to shed a few layers. If you stargaze in the fall or winter, try thermal underwear, sweaters, hats, gloves or mittens, and scarves. If you stargaze in the spring or summer, wear multiple, light layers. Try a zip-up hoodie, light jacket, hat, and jeans. Bring one warm coat in case the temperature drops dramatically during the night."
