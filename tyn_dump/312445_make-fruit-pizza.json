You can also line it with parchment paper or foil, and then butter it. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Sift the flour first to get rid of any lumps, then add the rest of the ingredients and mix them briskly with a fork. Once everything is evenly mixed together, set the bowl aside. Cream the butter, sugar, and vanilla, then add the egg. Place the butter and sugar into an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Blend until the mixture is light and creamy. Mix in the egg. Keep mixing until the yolk breaks up and everything is evenly blended. There should be no streaks or swirls of egg yolk or egg white. Slowly fold in the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Take the bowl out of the electric mixer, and fold the flour mixture in by hand using a spatula. Keep mixing until everything is evenly combined. Pat the dough into the bottom of your prepared pan. Make sure that it is covering the entire pan, from edge to edge, in an even layer. Grease your hands with butter or cooking spray to prevent the dough from sticking to your fingers. Bake for 12 to 14 minutes, then set aside to cool on a wire rack. While the crust cools, work on preparing your sauce and fruit topping. Making the Sauce Cream together the cream cheese and butter until smooth. Place the cream cheese and butter into the bowl of an electric mixer. Beat them together on medium speed for about 2 minutes, or until it is smooth. Add in the confectioner's sugar and 1 tablespoon of milk, and beat for another 2 minutes. Sift the sugar to get rid of any lumps before adding it to the butter mixture. For a richer sauce, use heavy cream instead. Stir in the vanilla extract and beat 1 minute longer. If the sauce is too thick for you, add another tablespoon of milk or cream and beat again. Spread the sauce onto the cooled crust. Use a spatula to spread the sauce over the crust in a thick, even layer. If you'd like, you can leave a slight rim all around the crust to achieve that \"pizza\" look. Adding the Toppings Choose a variety of fruit, enough to fill 4 cups (800 grams). Ideally, you should have at least two to three different types of fruit. Whatever you choose, make sure that it all amounts to 4 cups (800 grams) total. Here are some tasty combinations for you:\nBananas, kiwi, oranges, pineapple, and strawberries. Bananas, blueberries, kiwi, peaches, pineapple, and strawberries. Blueberries, kiwi, strawberries, and drained, canned mandarin oranges. Bananas, blueberries, kiwi, oranges, peaches, pineapple, and star fruit. Peel them and cut the fruit into thin slices. Small types of fruit, such as blackberries, blueberries, and raspberries do not need to be sliced. If you are using peaches, consider cutting them into thin wedges instead. Arrange the fruit on top of the pizza. You can arrange them randomly or artistically. For example, you could put the strawberries on the outside, followed by blueberries, kiwi, bananas, oranges, and pineapple. Finish off with more strawberries in the center. Consider brushing a glaze made from apricot preserves on top. Press some apricot preserves through a sieve to remove any lumps. When you have enough to fill \u00bc cup (80 grams), mix it with 1 tablespoon of water. Brush the mixture over the fruit. Refrigerate the pizza for 2 hours before serving. This will help the sauce set and \"glue\" the fruit to the pizza. When you are ready to serve the pizza, cut it into slices. Keep any leftovers in the fridge. Finished. ",
