                    "description": "One of the simplest methods for getting rid of spiders is vacuuming up egg sacs and webs as you run across them. This method works best when trying to get rid of a few spiders. It may not be very efficient if you have a large spider population living in your home, however. You can also use a broom to sweep away webs. Rather than killing spiders, you should transport them outside if possible. Spiders are a species that is very beneficial to humans, and they're rather noble once you understand them. Web-building spiders that spend most of their time along the ceiling are not likely to fall victim to the glue trap, but these are very effective against ground-dwelling spiders like jumping spiders and house spiders. Keep the trap flat to prevent it from curling up into itself. Discard the trap as soon as you collect a few spiders on it. Note that this is ineffective against spider eggs and webs, so you will likely need to use this method in conjunction with other techniques."

Carefully follow the instructions marked on the label to prevent the accidental poisoning of yourself, a family member, or a pet. Remember that only 2 species of thousands in North America can harm you in any significant way (The Black Widow and Brown Recluse). The others can bite, but will not do so unless threatened, and their bites are neither poisonous nor very painful. Spiders are about the best \"pest\" one could hope for in their house, as they kill tons of other pests that can cause harm to humans or spread disease. If you have a lot of them though, that's a serious indicator of a major pest control breach, as the spiders wouldn't be entering if there wasn't a lot of food to be had. Pyrethroids are chemicals made, in large part, from pyrethrum plants. These plants are in the chrysanthemum family. Most household insecticides contain pyrethroids, and a few common pyrethroids include bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, permethrin, and tetramethrin. Total release foggers are not generally effective against spiders. Understand the limit of residual insecticides. These poisons only work if spiders drag  themselves through the chemical after it is sprayed. If a spider manages to avoid the spray, the insecticide will have no effect on it."
