If the pocket is too deep, it will be unfairly easy for you to keep the ball in your net, and your stick will violate game regulations. In a game situation, a referee will not hesitate to penalize you for a non-regulation pocket\u2014so make a habit of checking your stick before you play. If your pocket is too deep, you can untie and adjust the strings. For men's lacrosse: Make sure that the pocket is not too shallow. When a ball is in your pocket and you hold the stick perfectly horizontally, the ball should not be visible above the rim of the head. If the pocket is too shallow, you will not be able to control the ball when you cradle, pass, and shoot. For women's lacrosse: As opposed to men's lacrosse, no pocket is allowed. The pocket of the ball must protrude from the top of the wooden or plastic rim when you hold the stick horizontally. This shallow pocket rule makes it easier for other players to dislodge the ball from your control\u2014and it also means that you will need to cradle differently to keep your ball in the stick."

Practice this until running with a stick is just as natural as running without. At first, practice cradling while you are standing still. As you improve, try to cradle while you run.

Be aware that you may need to adjust and readjust the pocket several times until it feels right. Performing Basic Cradling Use your dominant hand to control the stick. Hold the shaft of the lacrosse stick just below the head. You will slide this hand up and down the shaft to catch and throw the ball\u2014so think of your cradling position as an intermediate step between those actions.

Hold the stick with your dominant hand, near-vertically, so that the open rim of the head faces you. Leave a few inches of space between your dominant hand and the head of the stick. Swing the stick low between your knees in a V-motion, and fluidly place your non-dominant hand above your dominant hand on the stick. Pull the stick up to a cradling position on your non-dominant side, letting your dominant hand slide to the butt of the stick. Cradle with your non-dominant side.

If a defender attacks from your right side, it can be extremely useful to quickly switch your hands\u2014you can dodge to the left or avoid the defender with your left hand on top and your right hand near the butt of the stick. Cradling with One Hand Position your body between the ball and the defender. One-handed cradling will allow attackmen to move at full speed and use their body to shield the ball from defenders. However, it will take longer to pass or shoot as you must move your free hand back in position before you will be able to do either. Grip the stick just below the head. The stick should be nearly parallel to your torso. Use your free hand to create room from the defender. Hold your arm out with your hand pointed to the ground while you run to keep defenders from getting too close. Swing your stick arm back as your stick side leg steps forward. Keep your elbow bent. Make sure the face of the stick head faces your chest at all times. Flex your wrists to keep the ball in the pocket. The side-to-side motion generated will generate the same kind of force as the up and down motion of the two-handed cradle technique. Passing and Shooting the Ball Turn your stick vertically to catch the ball. Slide your dominant hand up to the \"throat\" of the head. When the ball sails into your pocket, pull your stick back a little bit so that it doesn't bounce out. Start cradling as soon as the ball hits your pocket. Bring your stick back down to its 45-60 degree cradling angle, curl the stick, and cradle close to keep the ball in the pocket while you run down the field or look for a pass. Practice catching\u2014have someone throw the ball to you, or throw it to yourself against a pitch-back or brick wall. Curl the stick out of the cradle so that the head faces straight up to throw or shoot. Slide your top hand down the shaft until it is directly above your bottom hand. Pull your stick back over your shoulder, directly out of the cradle. Whip the stick forward in the direction that you want to throw the ball. Make sure to look in the direction that you plan to throw. Practice this motion while you are standing still, then while you are running. Keep working at it until you can fluidly transition from cradling the ball to passing or shooting.",
