Your garage shelves are another good place to use for cleaning tools you don\u2019t need as often. Setting up Dog Care Basics Work out a dog care schedule with your family. Talk with your family to determine who will housebreak the dog, who will take the dog for walks, who will feed the dog, and who will play with it. Discuss what time these responsibilities will take place each day. You may want to walk the dog and let it use the bathroom first thing in the morning. Feed it immediately after you return home. Take the dog back out to use the bathroom after it finishes eating. Whoever wakes up earliest in the morning can take care of these responsibilities, if they are old enough. The rest of the afternoon can be filled with your other daily responsibilities. Give your dog breaks every few hours to go for walks and use the bathroom. The evening is a great time to play with the dog and feed it supper. Offer these tasks to your kids. They\u2019ll likely be at school during the day, so evening responsibilities can help them bond with the dog. Take the dog out for one last bathroom break just before the house settles down for bed. Decide which areas you may want to keep the dog out of and how you\u2019ll keep them out. Some areas you may want to keep the dog out of could be a guest bedroom or the bathrooms. You could settle on using a baby gate or just keeping the door closed to keep the dog out. Discuss whether the dog be living inside or kept outdoors. Some people do not like the idea of a dog living inside the house. If you want to keep your dog outside, make sure you have a fenced yard that\u2019s large enough for your dog to roam and play in. Alternatively, you may agree to keep the dog outside during the day and let it inside at night. If you choose to keep your dog outside for any extended period, make sure it has access to food and fresh water, along with a shelter to protect them from the elements. Talk about whether the dog can sleep in family beds or get up on the couch. Talk about how you\u2019ll keep the dog from getting up on the furniture if you don\u2019t want them on it. You may buy the dog its own furniture to use (like blankets and chairs) and hash out training methods to teach it that your furniture is off-limits. You could also agree to let it on some furniture (like specific chairs or one family member\u2019s bed) but not others. Decide who will stay home the first week to care for the dog. If possible, you or one of your family members should stay home to care for the dog the first week it comes home. This is about the usual amount of time it will take the dog to get used to living with you and fall into your routine. If no one in your household can stay home with the dog, look around for pet care services, like daycares and walking services. Look for obedience classes. Obedience classes are a great option if you\u2019re a new dog owner. They can help you learn the best ways to socialize and train your dog so your relationship can develop smoothly. Be sure to research different obedience classes in your area. Check Google and Yelp ratings for a class\u2019s quality. On top of being a good way to teach your dog proper behaviors, obedience classes help you build a relationship with your dog. This is why they are recommended any time you bring a new dog into your house. Make sure everyone in your home spends time at obedience training with your dog. This way your dog learns to listen to and bond with everyone in your house. Go vet shopping. Whether you\u2019re adopting an adult dog or a puppy, it\u2019s important to find a clinic to handle their basic care. You should set up an initial check-up soon after adopting your new dog. Look around at different vets in your area and compare prices and personalities. The best vet is one that is able to handle animals responsibly and compassionately, but also fits into your budget. If you know anyone else with a dog, ask them for vet recommendations. Word of mouth is a great way to find new, highly-recommended pet health professionals. Prepare a set of tags with your information to bring on adoption day. Getting your dog\u2019s tags ready in advance is a good safety measure. If your dog gets lost, anyone who finds it can get in touch with you by reading the tags attached to your dog\u2019s collar. If your dog has already been chipped by the adoption center, be sure to request that they modify the chip to feature your information. Ask the shelter about your dog\u2019s food and meal schedule. Suddenly switching your dog over to a new brand of food can upset their stomach. It\u2019s better for your dog\u2019s health to feed them the same way they were fed at the shelter. Wait at least one week before gradually introducing new food. If you need to switch your dog to a new food, do so gradually. Start by adding 1/4 cup of their new food to a bowl of their old food. Increase the amount of the new food and decrease the amount of the old food a little every day until your dog has fully transitioned. Implement your dog care routine. It\u2019s best to introduce your dog to its new daily routine from day one. The sooner they learn how living with you works, the easier it will be for them to adjust to life with your family. Start housebreaking and walking your dog according to the schedule you and your family discussed earlier.",
