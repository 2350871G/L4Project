Pointing the flat end of the knife against the grain of the scales, scrape the knife over the fish's body in long, even strokes until all the scales are removed. Flip the fish over and repeat on the other side. Then, run the fish under cold water to remove excess scales. If you're having trouble getting a good grip on your fish, wear rubber gloves while scaling."

Make a cut from the tail to the jaw bone, deep enough that you can see the fish's internal organs but no so deep you cut the fish in half. Depth will vary depending on the fish.

Stuff the fish with your chosen spice or flavoring until the inner cavity is full. For example, try stuffing your fish with minced cloves of garlic and four minced cilantro sprigs. If you have a bigger fish, try slicing one whole lemon and one whole orange. Stuff the fish with that."

You can also slice vegetables, such as onions, and place them on top of the fish prior to cooking. Try sprinkling two tablespoons of freshly chopped parsley over the fish with a spritz of lemon juice from a fresh lemon. For a spicy blend, add two tablespoons of chile powder."
