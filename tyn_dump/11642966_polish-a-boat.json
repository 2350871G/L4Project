Apply firm pressure as you scrub the boat so it lifts dirt or debris stuck on the surface. You can buy boat detergent at outdoors stores or specialty boat shops.

Replace the rag whenever it gets completely dirty. You can buy acetone from your local hardware store. If you can afford it, use methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) solvent instead of acetone since it can be more efficient. Acetone is very flammable, so be sure to store it away from heat sources or open flames.Warning: Acetone can cause eye and nose irritation if you inhale the fumes.

        "Opt for one that has an orbital head, which means it moves in random patterns so it doesn\u2019t leave swirl marks or burn through the gel coat.",

        "After 5\u201310 seconds, slowly increase the speed of the buffer until it reaches 2,000 RPM to work the polish into the surface.",
        "Keep running the buffer until the polish is clear on the boat.",
        "Overlap each of your horizontal strokes by 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) to ensure you polish the entire surface.",
        "Keep the buffer against the boat when you turn it off so excess polish doesn\u2019t splatter anywhere.",
        "Never hold the buffer in the same spot for longer than 2\u20133 seconds since you could melt through the gelcoat and damage the finish underneath.Warning: Be careful not to touch any stainless steel parts of your boat with the buffer pad since it will create a black mark that may transfer onto the fiberglass.",

        "You can wax your boat any time after you polish it, but avoid putting it back in the water until you do since it could get damaged easily.",

        "Dip a foam applicator pad or a soft cleaning rag into a tub of paste wax made for boats.",
        "Work the wax into a 1 ft \u00d7 3 ft (30 cm \u00d7 91 cm) area in a circular pattern so you have an even layer.",
