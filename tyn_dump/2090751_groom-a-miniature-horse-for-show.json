This shampoo will keep your horse's hair shiny and strong and shouldn't irritate your horse's skin. If you can't get special horse shampoo, use mild no-tears baby shampoo. Horse shampoo will cost anywhere from $5-$15. Fill a bucket with lukewarm water. If the water is too cold or too hot, it may startle your horse. Let the water sit in room temperature until it warms up. You can also use a faucet with an adjustable temperature to make sure that the water coming out of the faucet is warm. Dampen the neck of your horse with a sponge. Tie up your horse or have someone hold the leader while you groom it. Make sure you're working in a room that's room temperature or warmer so that the horse isn't cold as you bathe it. Dip a large, soft sponge into the bucket of water and rub it against the length of your horse's neck. Continue doing this until its entire neck is wet. If your horse looks uncomfortable or stomps its feet, lightly pat it and speak in a low voice to calm it down. Lather your horse's neck with a dime-sized drop of shampoo.
