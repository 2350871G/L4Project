On this blank simply put it to the address you will be delivering it to (note that you are responsible for getting it on time and ensuring the company makes enough products for your pre-sale). 3. This is where you write the exact date (Month, Day and Year) the product(s) must be delivered to the customer. 4. This is the date of when you created this sales receipt (so when you made a sale where you gave a product and received money, or a pre-sale). One again write in a Month, Day and Year format. 5.

Body Spray: Summer Scent. Please reprint the product name and the other variation if a customer wants more than one kind. E.g. Body Spray: Summer Scent (and then in the box under) Body Spray: Fall Scent\n7. Here please print the quantity of the product for each variation in numerical format (so: 1 or 12)\n8. Here you will print your Junior Achievement company name, this is not your product name unless you don't have a product name. E.g. Apple\n9. For this area, please ensure you put the amount of cents in the second column and dollars in the first. E.g. $12|00. Note that you need to write the unit price for each variation product. 10. The subtotal is multiplying the amount of products sold by the unit price. E.g. Sold 4 Summer Scent Body Sprays for $12.00 each, so I would write $48.00 here. Dollars in the first column and cents in the second. 11. Where it says sales tax, we have none as Junior Achievers. So always put $0.00. 12.
