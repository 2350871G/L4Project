Run the slices under cold water. Cleaning off the squash will remove any potential pesticides or dirt that was on the squash. This is an important step before you start cooking it. Making Basic Roasted Kabocha Squash Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Place the slices of kabocha squash evenly apart on a baking sheet. Turn your oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) to start the preheating process. You can use a metal or glass baking sheet. A preheated oven will ensure an even cook in your squash. Coat the squash with the oil. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil, avocado oil, or melted coconut oil on top of the slices of squash. Coat the slices evenly, making sure to get the oil on both sides. You can smooth the oil on the slices with a pastry brush or your fingers. Season the slices with cayenne pepper or cinnamon.

Cooking Sweet and Spicy Squash Preheat the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C). Turn the oven to 400 \u00b0F (204 \u00b0C) and wait for the preheating indicator light to come on or for your oven to beep. Doing this will ensure an even cook on your squash. Prepare the other ingredients while your oven preheats. Combine the sugar, cayenne pepper, and other dry ingredients in a bowl. Mix all of the dry ingredients in a bowl until they are well incorporated. This mixture will act as a dry rub that will infuse a sweet and spicy taste to your squash. Coat the squash slices with the dry spices. Sprinkle the slices with the dry rub that you created. Make sure to get even coverage over all of the squash for an even flavor. Pour the soy sauce and oil over the slices. Put 1.25 teaspoons (6.2 ml) of soy sauce and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil, avocado oil, or melted coconut oil onto the slices. Get an equal coverage of the wet ingredients onto all of the squash. If you are using coconut oil, you can put it in the microwave for 15 seconds to melt it. Bake the slices in the oven for 15 minutes and turn them over. As the squash cooks, it should turn golden brown. Once they have cooked for 15 minutes, flip them over with tongs or a spatula so that the other side also browns. If you fail to do this, one side of the squash may be soggy. Sprinkle the slices with more sugar and cook for another 15 minutes. Adding the sugar to the other side of the slices will let them caramelize. If you want your squash to be sweeter, use more sugar. Remove the slices from the oven and serve. Remove the slices from the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes in the container before you serve them. They should be aromatic and caramelized.
