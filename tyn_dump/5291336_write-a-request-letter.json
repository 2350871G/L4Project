There are times when it is best to inquire directly with a desired company as to whether they have any room for your unique set of skills. Figure out which one you are writing the letter for. Do research on the company so you can know exactly what it is they do, stand for, and could be looking for in a new employee. This will also help you to tailor your letter to highlight skills that they value. Look up employee reviews of the business. You can get a good sense of the work culture and see if it is a good fit for you. If you are laid-back, it might not be a good idea if you see that the company has a strict way of dealing with deadlines. Be wary if you only see good reviews without any of constructive criticism. That could be false advertising initiated by the company themselves."
