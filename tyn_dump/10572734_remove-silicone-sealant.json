Removing Caulk from Wood Remove loose pieces by hand. If you're removing the sealant because it is old, there is a good chance there will be unattached bits that are falling away from the wood. Pull off any pieces that can easily be removed by hand. Use a hot air blower to warm up the remaining sealant. This will soften the caulk and make it easier to remove.

Scrape off the rest of the sealant with the razor blade. Position the blade at a low angle, so it doesn't damage the wood surface. The sealant will come off in large pieces. Use your hands or the tweezers to completely remove the chunks. Remove the remaining residue with a silicone caulk remover. Start by reading the directions on the caulk remover bottle. Then, apply the remover to the area you just scraped and wipe it off with a damp cloth. Don't use too much moisture as this can also damage the wood.
