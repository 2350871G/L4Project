The first will be a \u201cneutral\u201d buffer with a pH of 7, and the second should be near the expected sample pH, either a pH of 4 or 9.21. Buffers with a higher pH (9.21) are best for measuring bases, whereas buffers with a low pH (4) are best for measuring acidic samples. Once you have chosen your buffers allow them to reach the same temperature as the pH meter because pH readings are temperature dependent. Pour your buffers into individual beakers for calibration. Check with your pH meter manufacturer, or current educational or professional institution, about acquiring pH buffer solutions. Buffers should be kept in a beaker for no longer than two hours. Discard the buffer when you are finished. Do not return it to its original container."
