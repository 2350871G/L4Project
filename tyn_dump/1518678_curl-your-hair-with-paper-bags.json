It\u2019s important that you work with damp hair, rather than wet hair. If your hair is too wet when you begin, the paper will soak up the water and will not hold your hair properly. For African American hair, start with dry hair. Spritz a little bit of water, oil, and a moisturizing product onto each section of hair. You can also put a bit of product into the palm of your hand, and massage it into each section of hair as you go."
