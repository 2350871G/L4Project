Bring the ingredients to a boil on high heat, stirring constantly. Add sugar and return to a boil. Stir the sugar in and continue stirring as the ingredients come to a full rolling boil. Allow the boil to continue for one minute (keep stirring). Remove from heat and skim. Take the pot off the heat and use a metal spoon to quickly skim the foam off the top of the mixture. Pour the hot jelly into sterilized jars. Place a funnel over a jar. Ladle the jelly into the jar, with 1/4 inch (6 mm) of headspace at the top. Wipe off the rims of the jars and put on the lids. Place the filled jars in a boiling-water canner for five minutes. Begin timing once the water is boiling. After five minutes, remove the jars and allow them to cool on wire racks. Cooking Jelly with Apples Sterilize a jelly bag. Use a hot iron on a clean jelly bag. Your jelly bag can be cheesecloth, a piece of muslin, a pillowcase or a thin tea cloth about eighteen inches (45 cm) square. Place the sterilized cloth over a large bowl or bucket. Wash and slice cooking apples. Rinse the apples under running water and pat them dry. If there are any bruised or rotten spots in the apples, cut those parts out.
