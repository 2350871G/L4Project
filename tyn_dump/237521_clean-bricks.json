Pressure washers are useful for spraying away stubborn patches of dirt or stains. You can purchase pressure washers online or buy them from many home improvement stores. If you don't own a pressure washer, you can buy or rent one from some home improvement stores. Spray the brick's surface with a pressure washer about 12\u201318 inches (30\u201346 cm) away.
