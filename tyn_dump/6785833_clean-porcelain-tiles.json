Mop the floor and let it sit for five to ten minutes. Then, mop the floor again, rinsing off the solution. The vinegar will help to disinfect, deodorize, and clean the tiles. For a professional option, use a cleaning solution from your local home hardware store or the cleaning supplies aisle. You should make sure the solution is safe for use on glazed or polished tile before you use it. You may want to do a spot test by using a small amount of the solution on the floor to ensure it does not damage the floor. If there are coffee stains on the tiles, you can use baking soda to remove them. Apply a sprinkle of baking soda on the stain and then dampen it with a clean cloth.
