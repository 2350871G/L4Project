Work outside if possible. If you have to work inside, open any windows in the room and set up a box fan to blow the paint fumes out of the windows. Lay down a tarp so paint doesn\u2019t get on the floor. You can also use newspaper or an old sheet if you don't have a tarp. Center the table or stand you'll be working on over the tarp.

Keep shaking the bottle vigorously until the paint and rubbing alcohol are completely mixed. Spraying on the Dye Put on latex gloves so you don\u2019t get paint on your hands. You'll be using your hands to work the paint into the wig, and acrylic paint can stain skin. Spray paint onto a section of the wig, holding the bottle 6 inches (15.24 cm) away. Spray the section of the wig a few times until there\u2019s a good amount of paint on it. The section should be fully saturated with paint. Use your fingers to comb the paint through the wig hairs. Make sure you\u2019re getting the paint on the hair underneath and not just on the surface of the wig. Use your fingers to rub the paint into the roots of the hair as well. Spray on more paint as needed until the entire section of hair is covered. Keep applying paint to sections of the wig until the entire wig is covered.

Flip the wig upside down so it\u2019s easier to check the hairs underneath. Use an old comb to comb the paint through the wig hairs to help cover any spots you missed. Finishing Your Wig Let your wig air dry for 1-2 hours. A lot of paint will drip off the wig while it\u2019s drying, so make sure you leave it over a tarp. Check back on your wig after 1 hour.

Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Make sure you take the time to rinse out all the extra paint from your wig. You don\u2019t want paint getting on your face or clothes when you wear it! Let the wig dry on a towel for 1-2 hours. Flip the wig over halfway through the drying process to air out the other side. Brush out the wig. Put the wig on a foam head if you have one so it's easier to brush out. Gently run a brush or comb from the roots of your wig to the tips. When you\u2019re finished, your wig should be knot and tangle free. Now your wig is ready to wear!",
