Trauma usually only occurs in one nail and is caused by running on rough surfaces, catching a nail on an object, or improper nail trimming. Trauma or health conditions like diabetes and low thyroid levels can lead to bacterial infection in the nail. Bacterial infections usually cause swelling, pain, and discharge around the nails. Fungal and parasitic infections are less common than bacterial infections but cause similar symptoms. Tumors can take different forms: lumps, bumps, swellings, redness, or discharge. Immune disease can also affect the nail and may make the nail brittle and prone to sloughing. Always bring these findings to the attention of your veterinarian as soon as possible for treatment."

You might have a groomer or vet show you how far to trim the nails. If a dog\u2019s nails grow too long, the quick will grow with it.
