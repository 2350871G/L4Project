Then, pull this yarn through the slipknot to create your first chain stitch. Repeat this 49 more times.Tip: Using a US size H (5.0 mm) crochet hook will create a dress for a baby 0 to 6 months. If you want to make a dress for a baby 6 to 12 months, follow the same pattern, but use the next hook size up, such as size I-9 (5.5 mm). Double crochet into the fourth stitch from the hook. Loop the yarn over the end of your crochet hook 1 time. Insert the hook into the fourth chain from your hook and yarn over again. Pull this yarn through the chain, yarn over again, and pull through the first 2 loops on the hook. Then, yarn over 1 more time and pull through 2 again to complete the stitch.

Insert the hook into the top of the chain of 3, yarn over, and pull through both stitches to secure them together. Chain 3 and double crochet until you reach the first armhole. Next, work 1 more round to create some space under the armholes before moving on to the skirt. Start the round with a chain of 3, then double crochet into each stitch in the round 1 time. Do this until you get to the first armhole opening, which is where you made the chain of 2. Work 4 double crochet stitches into the chain 2 space. Yarn over, insert your hook into the chain 2 space, yarn over again, and pull this yarn through the space. Then, yarn over again and pull through 2. Yarn over 1 more time, and pull through again to complete the first stitch. Repeat this 3 more times into the chain 2 space. Double crochet to the next armhole and repeat. After you complete the fourth double crochet stitch, work 1 double crochet stitch into each of the stitches in the round until you get to the next armhole.

Finish by double crocheting 1 time into each of the stitches in the round until you get to the end. Then, yarn over and pull through 2 to slipstitch the ends together. Making the Skirt Crochet a chain of 3 and double crochet into the same stitch. Picking up where you left off with the last round, make a chain of 3. Then, double crochet 1 time into the stitch space at the base of the chain. The chain of 3 counts as a double crochet stitch. Chain 1 and double crochet 2 times into the same stitch. Follow up the double crochet stitch with a chain of 1, then double crochet into the same space that you worked the last double crochet stitch into 2 more times. This will create a V-stitch in the space. Working many of these in the round will help to make the skirt flare out. Chain 1, skip 1, and repeat the first sequence in the next space. Work 2 double crochet, 1 chain, and 2 more double crochets. Follow the same pattern used before to work a V-stitch. Work 2 double crochets, chain 1, and then 2 more double crochets all in the same stitch. Repeat this sequence to the end of the round and slipstitch to connect the ends. Continue working additional rounds in the same stitch pattern. Start with a chain of 3 just as before. Then, double crochet, chain 1, and double crochet 2 more into the same space. Work the V-stitches in this round into the chain 1 spaces you formed in the last round. Do this for all subsequent rounds. Tip: To keep track of your rows, try downloading a row counting app. Tap the screen on your phone after you complete each row to make it easier to see where you are at. Slipstitch to connect the ends when your skirt is the desired length. After you complete a round, make sure to slipstitch to connect the ends. Otherwise, you will end up with an open skirt. Keep working in the same stitch pattern until your skirt is the desired length for the baby. You can make the skirt as long or as short as you like. For example, to make a short skirt, work 5 rounds in the V stitch. To make a longer skirt for the baby dress, work 8 rounds in the V-stitch. Sew the hook and eye closure onto the top corners of the dress back.Thread a needle and tie a knot in the ends of the thread. Then, hold 1 side of the hook and eye closure on the inside of the dress near the top corner of 1 side of the dress back. Insert the needle into the closure and through the yarn. Pull until the knot is up against the back of the yarn. Then, insert the needle through the closure and yarn again. Repeat this 7 more times and then tie the thread in a knot to secure it. Do the same thing for the other side of the hook and eye closure on the opposite side of the dress back.",
