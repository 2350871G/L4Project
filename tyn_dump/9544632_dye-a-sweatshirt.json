You can purchase chemical dye from most major retailers as well as specialty fabric stores. Gather plant materials in the color you want if you are using natural dye. A medium- to heavy-weight sweatshirt will likely need about one box of powder dye or 1/2 bottle of liquid dye, but that amount may be doubled for darker shades. If you are planning to use natural materials to dye your clothes, gather food materials in the color you want. For instance, beets can be used to dye your sweatshirt red, while carrots can be used to get an orange color. When choosing a color, remember that the base shade of your sweatshirt will affect the final color. For instance, if you try to dye a yellow sweatshirt blue, it will probably end up green."
