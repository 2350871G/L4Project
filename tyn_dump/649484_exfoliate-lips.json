Rinse the mixture off with warm, not hot, water \u2013 cup your hands and splash water onto your mouth until it\u2019s clean. Pat your lips dry and apply petroleum jelly or hydrating lip balm to moisturize your lips. You can use white or brown sugar, but not powdered. Coconut oil is a tasty alternative to olive oil. The longer (and harder) you rub the mixture on your lips the more intensely it will exfoliate. Do this for about a minute, maximum. Too much exfoliating can make lips sore or chapped. Oil-based scrubs are great for dry skin because they're very hydrating."

Baking soda and water do not moisturize your lips at all, so be sure to apply a moisturizing lip balm when you\u2019re done.

You can use your finger if you wash your hands first, or a soft toothbrush, clean washcloth, or cotton swab. Leave the paste on for 2-3 minutes. Wash it off with warm water \u2013 honey is sticky so it may take a few minutes of washing. Rub your lips gently with a cloth, then moisturize. You can also leave this scrub on overnight if you wish. After you apply the scrub, put a strip of paper towel on your lips and lightly push it down \u2013 this will keep the scrub from getting all over your bedding and face. Sleep on your back and keep your head upright. Remove the paper strip in the morning, wash the scrub off, and moisturize your lips well."
