Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 4 minutes, large eggs 4 to 5 minutes, and extra large eggs 5 minutes. Medium-boiled eggs have a firm white and a semi-firm yolk with some hint of liquid running throughout. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 5 minutes, large eggs 6 minutes, and extra large eggs 7 to 8 minutes. Hard-boiled eggs have a firm white and firm yolk.

Scrambled eggs are difficult to store and reheat, so you should enjoy them as soon as they finish cooking. Boiled Place eggs in a pot of water. Put your eggs in a medium to large saucepan and fill the pan with enough water to cover the eggs completely. Note that the eggs should be at room temperature before you begin to boil them for best results, as this generally prevents eggs from cracking as they boil. You can use cold eggs, but cold eggs are more likely to crack. Also note that older eggs are better to boil than fresh eggs. The shell will be easier to remove from the fully cooked egg if you start with an egg that is at least a few days old. The closer the eggs are to their expiration date, the easier it will be to peel them once done. Bring the water to a boil. Heat the water over medium-high heat until it reaches a rolling boil. Do not salt the water since doing so will increase the length of time needed to boil the water. Turn off the heat and cover the pan. As soon as the water begins to boil, turn the heat off, cover the saucepan, and let the eggs cook in the still-hot water for several minutes until they reach desired doneness. The precise time will vary based on how large your eggs are and whether you want them to be soft-boiled, medium-boiled, or hard-boiled. Soft-boiled eggs have a firm white but a runny yolk. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 4 minutes, large eggs 4 to 5 minutes, and extra large eggs 5 minutes. Medium-boiled eggs have a firm white and a semi-firm yolk with some hint of liquid running throughout. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 5 minutes, large eggs 6 minutes, and extra large eggs 7 to 8 minutes. Hard-boiled eggs have a firm white and firm yolk. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 12 minutes, large eggs 17 minutes, and extra large eggs 19 minutes. Place the eggs in cold water. As soon as the eggs have finished cooking, remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and dunk them into a bowl of cold ice water. Let the eggs sit for at least 10 minutes in the ice water. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5a\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5a\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nThis is not a crucial step, but dunking the eggs in cold water will stop the cooking process and ultimately make it easier for you to peel the eggs. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cd\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/cd\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Eggs-Step-9Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Peel and enjoy.

Fill a medium saucepan halfway with water and set it to a simmer over medium heat. Do not allow the water to reach a full boil. Break the eggs and lower them into the simmering water. Break each egg one at a time into a ladle or serving spoon and lower the spoon into the pan until it hits the bottom. Slide the egg off so that it sticks to the bottom of the pan.

Enjoy immediately. Baked or Shirred Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). Meanwhile, prepare two 6-oz (180-ml) ramekins by greasing them with the butter. You could spray the ramekins with cooking spray for a lighter alternative, if desired. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b7\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Eggs-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/b7\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Eggs-Step-15Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nIf you do not have ramekins, you can use any small oven-safe cooking dish of similar size.

Gently crack the eggshell on the side of the dish and drop the egg directly onto the cream. Do not break the yolk and do not stir the egg and cream together. Note that each ramekin should contain half the cream and two of the four eggs. For presentation purposes, use a dinner spoon to carefully shift the yolks to the center of the dish. Sprinkle the eggs with salt, pepper, and cheese. Lightly sprinkle these seasonings over the eggs in the ramekins but do not mix or stir them in. Bake 12 to 15 minutes. Place the eggs in your preheated oven and cook until the whites are set. Note that the yolks should still be soft, though. Let set for 2 to 3 minutes before serving. Remove the eggs from the oven and allow the to sit out briefly so that the internal temperature drops and the cooking process halts. Sunny-Side Up Spray a frying pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set the frying pan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat and wait several minutes for it to get hot. Ideally, the pan should be hot enough so that a drop of water immediately sizzles away into steam if dropped inside. Crack the eggs into the pan. Gently tap the shell on the side of your pan or on the countertop. Break the egg open and let it drop directly into the pan. Cook one egg at a time to prevent the whites from running together. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/81\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/81\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDrop the eggs carefully so that the yolks do not break. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/57\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/57\\/Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-759px-Cook-Eggs-Step-21Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":306,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":506.31868131868134,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Cook the eggs until the whites set.

Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and beat them gently by hand using a wire whisk. Gradually add the stock and soy sauce as you whisk the eggs to combine them. Divide the mushrooms into four ramekins. Evenly distribute your mushrooms into four separate ramekins. Shiitake mushrooms are the most traditional, but you can substitute them for your favorite mushroom or a more accessible one if desired. You can also add up to 1 cup (250 ml) chopped cooked chicken broth or seafood, if desired. Pour the egg mixture into each cup. Pour an even amount of the egg mixture over the mushrooms in your ramekins until each ramekin is filled. The ramekins should be filled anywhere between 1/2 to 3/4 high. Boil 1 inch (2 1/2 cm) of water in a steamer. As soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Note that a heavy saucepan with deep sides will work in the absence of a steamer. Place the ramekins in your steamer. Transfer the ramekins to the steamer, arranging them in a single, even layer. Cover and let cook for 12 minutes. If you have a steamer tray, place the ramekins on the tray to keep them out of the water. If not, they may be placed in the water as long as the water does not threaten to overflow into the dish. When done, the eggs should have a firm but silky texture slightly reminiscent of tofu. Serve. Lift the ramekins out of the steamer and enjoy immediately.
