                    "description": "A fountain pen\u2019s nib is mostly flat with a sharp tip. It has to be positioned so the tip is against the paper in order for the ink to flow out. Rotate the pen so the flat underside of the nib is facing your palm. It is a little different than using a ballpoint pen, but it\u2019s something you get accustomed to the more you use your pen. Some people refer to the positioning as the sweet spot. When the nib hits the sweet spot, the pen is able to glide over the page while releasing a steady flow of ink."

Let the back end of the pen rest between the edge of your hand between your index finger and thumb. Then, test the pen to see if you\u2019re able to move it across the page with ease. You can change the angle a little bit without stopping the pen from working. However, it won\u2019t work if you hold the pen too straight, so keep it diagonal from the page."

                    "description": "Many people make the mistake of gripping too hard when first using a fountain pen. Ooly pens are no different and are more likely to shred your paper than anything else if you\u2019re writing with a lot of force. Grip lightly, applying just enough force to keep the pen steady. Release your grip a little bit if you notice the pen scratching or cutting into the paper. Ooly pens require way less force to use than regular ballpoint pens. Always try to be as gentle as you can when using one."

Instead, move your arm to sweep the pen along the page. While doing this, continue holding the pen at the same angle with the same amount of pressure. When your pen falls out of position, it will begin skipping or scratching along the page. Stop and readjust your grip. Ballpoint pens have a rounded tip, so they work no matter how you\u2019re holding them. Ooly pens won\u2019t work the same way, but your hand won\u2019t tire out quite as quickly."
