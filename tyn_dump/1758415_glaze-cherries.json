To make the process easier, use a cherry pitter. You put each cherry in the device, press the handle, and it separates the stone without ruining the cherry. If you don\u2019t have a pitter, remove the cherries by hand. An easy way to do this is to set a cherry on top of a narrow-necked bottle. Using a wood skewer or chopstick, push down on the cherry\u2019s center from above. Another way to remove the stones is through cutting. Using a sharp paring knife, cut into the bottom of the cherry.
