Mason jars come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and even colors, so it is important for you to choose the right type for your specific project. If you plan to use your jar as a flower vase, for example, you will likely want to select a larger sized jar. If you are going to use your jar for toiletry or make up storage, you might want to select a small and short Mason jar. If your Mason jar is old or appears to be dirty, make sure that you clean it with dish soap and warm water. Air dry completely or thoroughly dry with a paper towel or rag before applying any paint. Mason jars are sold at most craft stores, grocery stores, and some home improvement stores, so it should be easy for you to find the size and shape you want to use for your project."

These items can be purchased in small or pre-broken, mosaic-ready form at most craft stores, or you can make them yourself. If you want to create a soothing, beachy candle holder, for example, seashells or seaglass would both be great options for your mosaic material. If you are going for a more funky, bohemian vibe with your Mason jar, broken tiles might be a better bet. To create your own mosaic materials, drop or throw the glass, mirror, or tiles on the ground, break them on a hard surface with a hammer, or use glass cutters for more precisely shaped pieces.

You may be tempted to continue earlier, but it is important that you wait until the adhesive has cured before you start grouting.

If you do not purchase a pre-mixed grout, mix your mosaic grout by following the instructions on the label. If you are applying grout with your hands, you may want to wear gloves, as mosaic grout can be difficult to remove from skin.

Use a hot glue gun to apply glue to the strip of burlap and adhere it to the Mason jar by wrapping it around and holding it in place until the fabric is secure. If you want to cover more of your Mason jar, cut the fabric wider to suit your taste. If you want more of the jar to show, cut the strip of fabric thinner. You can also use twine or string to adhere the burlap to your Mason jar. To do this, cut a piece of twine or string about twice as long as the circumference of the jar.

Using a glue gun, apply a thin layer of glue evenly across all of the edges and most of the fabric. Carefully, pick up the fabric and place it where you want it on your Mason jar. Hold it in place for at least 30 seconds to ensure that it is securely in place. Let it dry according to the instructions for your glue. Make sure that you use a doily or lace that is suitably sized for your Mason jar. In general, the best size is one that covers the jar fully without having to be cut. Doilies and lace fabric are very delicate, so it is best to cut as little as possible to avoid unraveling. While it is recommended that you use a hot glue gun to securely adhere fabric to your Mason jar, you can also use a craft adhesive suitable for glass. Apply carefully with a small paint brush."

Cut your string, ribbon, or twine approximately twice as long as the circumference you measured. Wrap around the jar and secure tightly with a decorative knot or bow. You may want to trim your string, ribbon, or twine after you have secured it around the Mason jar if too much excess hangs down.

Using a glue gun, apply a thin layer of glue evenly across all of the edges and most of the fabric. Carefully, pick up the fabric and place it where you want it on your Mason jar. Hold it in place for at least 30 seconds to ensure that it is securely in place. Let it dry according to the instructions for your glue. Make sure that you use a doily or lace that is suitably sized for your Mason jar. In general, the best size is one that covers the jar fully without having to be cut. Doilies and lace fabric are very delicate, so it is best to cut as little as possible to avoid unraveling. While it is recommended that you use a hot glue gun to securely adhere fabric to your Mason jar, you can also use a craft adhesive suitable for glass. Apply carefully with a small paint brush. Wrap with string, ribbon, or twine for a quick and easy Mason jar decoration. Measure the circumference of the part of the Mason jar you wish to adorn (this could be the neck of the Mason jar, the part right below where the cap screws on, or the body of the jar, the thickest part of the jar). Cut your string, ribbon, or twine approximately twice as long as the circumference you measured. Wrap around the jar and secure tightly with a decorative knot or bow. You may want to trim your string, ribbon, or twine after you have secured it around the Mason jar if too much excess hangs down. If you want a rustic farmhouse vibe but want a thicker option, consider cutting a 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) strip of burlap or lace to use instead of string, ribbon, or twine. Decorating a Mason Jar with Decoupage Clean and dry your Mason jar. Use dish soap and water to clean thoroughly. Leave out to air dry, or pat dry completely with a towel. Mod Podge is a relatively strong adhesive that works well with glass, but only if the glass is completely dry. Select your decoupage materials. Choose a common decoupage material, including magazine pages, wrapping paper, maps, graph paper, or personal photographs printed on paper, or get creative with a new idea. Almost any paper product will work for a Mason jar decoupage project, so you have many options for your decoupage materials. Whatever you choose, make sure that you have enough material to cover all of your Mason jar, or as much of your jar that you want to decoupage. Paint the Mason jar with an even coat of Mod Podge. Using a paint brush, dip the brush in the Mod Podge and immediately apply to the jar. If you want to cover the entire jar in decoupage, you will also want to paint the inside of the neck of the jar so that you can fold your material over the top and adhere it to the inside of the neck to cover the rim of the jar. Apply your decoupage material to the Mason jar. Start applying your materials to the Mason jar immediately so that the Mod Podge does not begin to dry. When the material is secure around the body of the jar, press the paper around the neck, making sure that you adhere the material in all the crevices. If you are applying one large piece of paper, wrap the material all the way around the Mason jar, pressing tightly so that it adheres to the glass. If you are using multiple smaller pieces of paper, place each piece where you want it on the jar and press down firmly. Using scissors, cut a few slits around any excess material on the top and bottom so that it folds down easily. Fold any excess material over the top and bottom and press to secure. Apply a coat of Mod Podge evenly over the Mason jar. Once your material is in place and securely adhered to the Mason jar, apply another coat of Mod Podge over the outside of all the paper. Let the Mod Podge dry according to the instructions. Trim away any excess paper. Once the Mod Podge is completely dry, use scissors trim away any excess paper that hangs over or does not lay flat. If you cannot cut close enough to trim as cleanly as you\u2019d like, you can add another layer of Mod Podge to secure any stubborn bits in place. Let any touch-ups dry completely before use.",
