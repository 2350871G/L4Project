Just ensure that you have about 3 inches of oil in the bottom of the fryer. Heat the oil between 360 and 375 degrees F (182 to 190 C). If you don't have a wok or deep-fryer, you can use a wide saucepan to fry the sweet potato chips. You may want to attach a deep-fry thermometer to the fryer so you can check the temperature as you fry."

It may be easier to use a mandolin and slice them on the thinnest setting. A mandolin will give you more uniform chips.
