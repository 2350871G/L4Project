They are also useful inside the home in areas that receive heavy general wear. Due to their dense, high-gloss finish, surfaces painted with enamel paints are easily cleaned and resistant to staining and damage. If the project you\u2019re working on requires a piece to be able to withstand lots of abuse, enamel paints are probably right for you. Enamel paints are also a good pick for any material that needs a slick, protective finish. Bathroom fixtures and metal appliances are often finished with enamel paints."

With recent increased demand for non-toxic paint alternatives, water-based enamel paints have become more common. Water-based enamel paints can be simpler to work with, as they dry faster and are easier to clean, while oil-based enamel paints last longer and provide a smoother, more durable finish. The choice to use an oil-based vs. a water-based paint is largely preference. Water-based paints will do nicely for basic projects, while heavy duty oil-based paints will hold up to constant wear and harsh outdoor conditions. There exists a wide variety of enamel paints.

For best results, select a brush that features the right filament type and stiffness for the paint you\u2019re using. A Chinese or ox-hair brush, for instance, is a softer-bristled brush that helps spread thick oil-based paints effortlessly. When working with water-based enamel paints, brushes made from synthetic fibers are preferable, as the filaments won\u2019t soak up the water contained in the paint and become soggy. Some brushes are designed with angled bristle edges that aid in painting smoother lines. This type of brush would be ideal for working with enamel paint, which demands an even finish. Stick to one type of brush for one type of paint. For instance, while it\u2019s okay to use a synthetic filament brush with an oil-based enamel paint, it\u2019s better to choose a new brush if you\u2019ve already used the synthetic brush with a water-based paint."

A preliminary coat of primer will fill crevices in wood grain, cover inconsistencies in unfinished materials and give the paint a more uniform area to stick to. Most primers are oil-based, which allows them to form a better seal against the wood and helps paint hold better once the primer is dry. It is recommended that you use a coat of primer before applying enamel paint, especially on indoor surfaces, furniture, cabinets and trim. Look for primers that are approved for use on the type of surface you're painting. Some brands of enamel paint are even formulated with built-in primers which improve the adhesion of the paint. Always use a primer when painting wood and other uneven natural materials, walls, cabinets, trim and any surface with variations in dimension and texture."

For this reason, it\u2019s advisable to use a second \u201ctip off\u201d stroke after brushing on the top layer of paint. To do this, make sure the brush\u2019s bristles are wet with paint (but not oversaturated) and angle the brush as you make the second pass so that only the tips run along the area that you just painted. When using the tip off technique, make sure that you drag the brush along the entire length of the painting surface (with the natural grain if you\u2019re painting wood) to keep the thickness and orientation of each stroke uniform. Take care to make your brush strokes as fluid and even as you can. Some surfaces, such as furniture and handmade crafts, will be harder to paint than others due to their many irregular contours."

A sprayer will ensure that the paint goes on in even coats. Using a sprayer can save you time on jobs where there\u2019s a lot of area to cover, such as refinishing outdoor furniture and appliances. A sprayer will help you quickly take care of rugged painting projects such as coating a patio deck or touching up mechanical equipment.

Use two coats of paint on stairs, outdoor work spaces and any surface that receives regular exposure to the elements.
