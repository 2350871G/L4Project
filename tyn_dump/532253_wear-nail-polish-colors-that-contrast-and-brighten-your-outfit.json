    "text": " Rocking Some Red Wear standard or dark red nail polish with anything black. Anything from a casual black shirt to a more formal black dress will work perfectly with this color. Pair red nail polish with jeans. Generally, choose darker shades of denim instead of lighter shades when you're wearing red nail polish. Wear white in moderation. A white shirt with red nail polish works, but if you wear too much white, then the pairing will become garish. Add some accessories. Red nail polish pairs well with diamond earrings, pearl studs and silver earrings. You can also choose a gray or black accessory such as a headband. Picking Pink Pair neon pink with an understated outfit. Choose a simple black, gray or white ensemble. Pair opaque pink with just about anything. Opaque pink is great for an outfit with bold patterns because it will spiff up your nails without distracting from your clothing. An opaque pink also serves as a great alternative to a blas\u00e9 neutral color like tan. Avoid pairing a strong pink nail polish with bright colors. You'll come across as frightening instead of fashionable. Neon pink does not, for instance, go with reds, fluorescents or metallics. Skip the pastels when you're wearing pink nail polish.
