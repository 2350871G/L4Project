If your only goal is to spend a few minutes every day being present in your body without worrying about everything you have to do, that\u2019s reason enough to meditate. Try not to over-complicate your reasons for meditating. At its core, meditation is just about relaxing and refusing to be caught up in everyday anxieties."

Ask the people you live with if they would be willing to keep quiet for the duration of your meditation exercise.

A scented candle, a bouquet of flowers, or incense can be great little touches to enhance your meditation experience. Dim or turn out the lights to help you concentrate."
