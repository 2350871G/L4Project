You\u2019ll start to see the fat particles floating or foaming towards the top of the stockpot. Don\u2019t allow the soup to continue at a rolling boil.

Continue scooping up the fat until there\u2019s enough collected in the mesh to discard. Dunk the mesh skimmer in a bowl of water or rinse it off under running water to remove the fat residue. This method works particularly well for skimming chicken stock."

Keep the ice cubes in the spoon while you touch the back of the spoon to the surface of the soup. Glide the back of the spoon gently across the fatty globules. The fat will solidify and stick onto the back of the spoon. Lift up the spoon and discard any fat that\u2019s stuck to the bottom. When the cold metal touches the hot soup, the fat that has gathered near the surface will quickly coagulate onto the spoon so you can peel it off. Wipe off the fat onto a paper towel and repeat the process to remove all of the fat. You must use a metal spoon for this method. A wooden or plastic spoon won\u2019t get as cold. Don\u2019t submerge the whole spoon into the soup. Just hold it parallel to the surface of the liquid while the fat gathers on the back of the spoon."

Then, carefully pour the broth through the towel-lined colander and into the pot. The fat globules will solidify and stick to the cold towel as the rest of the soup runs into the stockpot. Choose a stockpot or serving bowl with plenty of space below the bottom of the colander. If it\u2019s too shallow, the soup will fill up around the colander and it won\u2019t strain properly.
