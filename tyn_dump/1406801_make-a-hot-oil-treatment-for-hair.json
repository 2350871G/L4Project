It is also common at specialty and import grocery stores, and at some beauty supply stores. Coconut oil is usually sold in a jar. It is solid at room temperature but will turn to a liquid in the palm of your hand. It melts at a relatively low temperature. You can also use olive oil as the main oil in the treatment. Olive oil is a natural moisturizer and can help with dandruff, but does not have the protein preserving properties of the coconut oil. Olive oil is liquid at room temperature, but will heat well using the same method as the coconut oil treatment."
