To wake up with the most manageable hair, apply a styling cream from root to tip after washing it. Next, pull your hair back into a tight bun at the nape of your neck and go to sleep. In the morning, undo the bun and you\u2019ll have soft, sleek waves. Run your fingers through them to gently separate them."
