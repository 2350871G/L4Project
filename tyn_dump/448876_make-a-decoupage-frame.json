Joy Cho\t\t\tDesigner & Style Expert, Oh Joy! It\u2019s essential to pay attention to the edges of your frame. You usually don\u2019t want to use paper that\u2019s too thick. Try thinner tissue paper or wrapping paper instead. Start by painting the frame with glue and then apply the paper so that it folds over the edge cleanly and crisply. Trim the edges on the backside and always follow the edges of the frame."
