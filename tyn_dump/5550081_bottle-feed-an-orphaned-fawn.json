        "Pinch the skin between the fawn\u2019s shoulder blades to check for hydration.",
        "About 1 hour after giving it the first bottle of pediatric electrolyte drink, use 2 fingers to pinch the skin between its shoulder blades.",
        "If the skin drops immediately when you let go, the fawn is adequately hydrated.",
        "If the skin remains pinched up briefly after you let go, the fawn is still dehydrated.",
        "This is called a \u201cskin turgor\u201d test and is useful in checking for dehydration in many kinds of animals.",
        "Conduct this test only if advised to do so by the wildlife rehabilitator.",
        "If they'll be arriving soon to evaluate the deer, they may want to conduct the test.",
        "Give additional electrolyte bottles if directed by the wildlife rehabilitator.",
        "Based on the results of the \"skin turgor\" test, the wildlife rehabilitator may request that you give the fawn one or more additional bottles of pediatric electrolyte solution.",
        "If so, you'll likely be advised to give a bottle every 1-2 hours, and to conduct the skin turgor test in between each bottle.",
        "Once the fawn is adequately hydrated (based on the skin turgor test), the wildlife rehabilitator may ask you to start feeding the fawn goat's milk or a milk replacer.",
        "Switching to Milk for Bottle-Feeding Warm 2\u20134  fl oz (59\u2013118 ml) of goat\u2019s milk or milk replacer in the bottle.",
        "If you\u2019re using goat\u2019s milk, just pour it into the bottle.",
        "With milk replacer, you\u2019ll need to measure and add the powder to the amount of water in the bottle, screw on the goat/lamb nipple and pinch it shut, then shake the bottle vigorously to combine.",
        "Warm the bottle contents to body temperature by placing the bottle in a bowl of hot tap water.",
        "Hold the bottle in your hand to estimate when it reaches body temperature (a precise measurement isn't necessary).",
        "Use 2\u20134  fl oz (59\u2013118 ml) for a knee-high fawn (based on its shoulder height when standing), and 4\u20136  fl oz (120\u2013180 ml) for a waist-high fawn.",
        "Don't start giving a fawn milk unless expressly requested to do so by a wildlife rehabilitator.",
        "In most cases, they'll either advise not to offer anything by a bottle or to start with a pediatric electrolyte drink.",
        "Feed the fawn a full bottle every 3-4 hours.",
        "Fawns typically need to feed 6-7 times per day, so plan on spacing out feedings every 3-4 hours until the wildlife rehabilitator arrives.",
        "Approach the fawn from the front and above, dribble some of the milk between its lips so it latches on to the nipple, and hold the bottle high as it drinks.",
        "Make sure you\u2019re keeping the bottle elevated so the fawn has to stretch its neck and head to reach it\u2014this replicates feeding from its mother.",
        "If the fawn bleats for more milk right after a feeding or between feeding times, ignore it\u2014fawns will drink until they make themselves ill if permitted to do so.",
        "Stimulate the fawn's bowels while feeding it, if necessary.",
        "Fawns often need help stimulating urination and defecation.",
        "If it's not urinating or defecating during or after feedings, put on rubber gloves and gently rub a baby wipe (or damp cloth you don\u2019t mind ruining) over its anus and genitals.",
        "A bowel movement will typically follow soon after.",
        "This maneuver replicates the bowel stimulation the mother achieves through licking.",
        "If the fawn still isn\u2019t defecating and urinating, or if it has diarrhea, contact the wildlife rehabilitator again.",
        "Limit bonding by feeding fawns in groups, if possible.",
        "Every time you feed a fawn, it will bond with you a little more and become less able to successfully return to the wild.",
        "If you happen to have more than one fawn that needs care, feeding them simultaneously\u2014feeding 2 at a time with a bottle in each hand, for instance\u2014will slow down the bonding process.",
        "Think very carefully before deciding you want the fawn to bond with you and become your pet.",
        "Keeping a wild deer as a pet may be illegal where you live, and raising a fawn to adulthood requires a great deal of effort and about $500 USD in expenses."
