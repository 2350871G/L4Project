The lime juice will penetrate into the meat of the ribs, both tenderizing the meat and infusing it with a zesty flavor.

The rub will make the meat more flavorful and will also help seal in moisture as it cooks. You can buy a pre-mixed rib rub or make your own. You can make a very basic rub by combining a tablespoon (about 17 g) of salt with 1 tablespoon (about 7 g) each of black and red pepper. For a more complex flavor, try mixing 1.5 tsp (6.25 g) of brown sugar, 1 tbsp (6.9 g) of paprika, 1.5 tsp (3 g) of fresh orange zest, 1.25 tsp (7.11 g) of salt, \u00be tsp (1.5 g) of cumin, \u00bd tsp (1.3 g) of ground black pepper, and \u00bc tsp (0.65 g) of ground cayenne pepper.

You can safely let fresh pork ribs chill with the rub on them for 3 to 5 days. However, the salt in the rub will eventually cause a loss of moisture and give the meat a \u201chammy\u201d flavor. For the best flavor, try not to let the rub sit longer than around 12 hours."

If your grill does not have a built-in thermometer, you can test the approximate temperature of the grill by holding the palm of your hand about 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the grate for a few seconds. If you can keep your hand there for 4 to 5 seconds before you have to pull it away, it\u2019s around the right temperature.

At that temperature, you should be able to hold your hand above the grill for 6 to 7 seconds. You can adjust the temperature of a charcoal grill by opening or closing the vents.
