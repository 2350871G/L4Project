This will prevent the saw from shifting as you sharpen it, and result in a much more consistent and easy sharpening process. Note: If you need to sharpen a chainsaw but don\u2019t have a vise or clamp, you can go without it. Be careful to keep the chainsaw steady as you file it if you can\u2019t secure it in place. If you don\u2019t have a clamp or vise that will keep your chainsaw in place, you can remove the chain and secure that in your vise instead. This will require a little more adjustment but is an easy alternative. You might find it easier to secure the chainsaw upside down on your work surface.

        "Repeat until you get back to the starting mark you made.",
        "These two cutters are referred to as right and left cutters.",
        "By alternating them, the chainsaw is more easily able to cut in a straight line without leaning to one side or another.",
        "If you file one type of cutter more than another, you will risk throwing the balance of the chainsaw off.",
        "Make sure you stay consistent across all cutters.",
        "Rotate the chainsaw 180 degrees.",
        "Loosen your vise or clamp and rotate the chainsaw 180 degrees.",
        "This reveals the alternate cutters that you skipped sharpening in the first loop around the chain and means you don\u2019t need to change your stance or method.",
        "Tip: If you can\u2019t easily adjust the position in which the chainsaw is held, you can also move around the chainsaw or adjust the position of your file so that it faces the other direction.",
        "Regardless, make sure you remain consistent.",
        "Use the same motion to sharpen every other tooth.",
        "Move around the chain again, sharpening each tooth that has not yet been sharpened.",
        "Make sure to use the same amount of pressure and run the file through the same amount of times in order to keep each cutter consistent and level.",
        "Filing the Rakers Place a depth gauge over the chain.",
        "A depth gauge is a tool used to ensure the heights of the rakers are kept at the right height.",
        "They should be available at your local hardware store, and may even come with the file.",
        "Set the depth gauge over the chain near your starting point and push it forward until it presses against a raker.",
        "The rakers are the bumps along the chain in between each cutter.",
        "They function to keep the depth of the cut consistent as the chain spins around the saw, so making sure each is level is very important.",
        "Check for any part of the raker above the top of the depth gauge.",
        "Either by observing it or by feeling over the top of the depth gauge for a bump, check whether or not the top of the raker sits higher than the top of the depth gauge.",
        "If it does, it will need to be filed down.",
        "If not, move the gauge forward to the next raker until you find one that does.",
        "Use a flat mill bastard file to level the raker.",
        "Holding the depth gauge in place, run a flat file over the top of the raker until it is level with the depth gauge.",
        "While the depth gauge will protect other teeth from being filed, there is nothing to stop the gauge itself from being filed down.",
        "Be careful not to file away the gauge, as this can lead to inconsistencies between rakers.",
        "To entirely avoid filing the gauge, slide it back while you file over the raker.",
        "Check the height of the raker consistently as you file until it lines up with the top of the depth gauge.",
        "Once you have filed the raker down, it might have a square top.",
        "Use the flat file to very slightly smooth off the edges without filing down the height of the raker any further.",
        "A flat file that will work for the rakers should be available at your local hardware store.",
        "Unlike the round file, it doesn\u2019t need to be any specific size.",
        "File every other raker to the same height.",
        "Continue the same process of checking rakers with a depth gauge and filing them down all the way around the rest of the chain.",
        "Unlike the cutters, you don\u2019t need to worry about filing the same raker twice as you are filing the rakers down.",
        "Tip: As with the round file, if you notice any metal shavings getting caught up in the flat file, tap it on a surface once or twice to loosen them before continuing to file.",
        "Loosen the chain and release the chainsaw.",
        "Use the adjustment screws to loosen the chain of your chainsaw back to a usable tension.",
        "Loosen the clamp or vise holding the chainsaw in place and take the chainsaw out.",
        "Your chainsaw should now be sharpened evenly and ready to use.",
        "A chain on a chainsaw at a usable tension should have no visible slack as you hold it.",
        "When you lift the chain up, it should have around \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) of give and snap back when released.",
        "Refill the bar oil reservoir in your chainsaw.",
        "Turn your chainsaw on its side to reveal the cap for the oil reservoir.",
        "Unscrew the cap and use a funnel to pour in bar and chain oil, which should be available from your local hardware store.",
        "Make sure the cap is tightly screwed back in before you operate your chainsaw.",
        "Tip: Instead of bar and chain oil, you can use a vegetable oil such as canola oil.",
        "This is biodegradable and therefore more environmentally friendly."
