    "text": " Making a Chocolate Rose Bouquet Gather some Hershey's Kisses. You will need two Hershey's Kisses for each rose. Your bouquet can have as many \"roses\" in it as you want. If you want a more traditional looking rose bouquet, get 24 Hershey's Kisses; this will make a dozen roses. For an even more rose-like bouquet, use red or pink Hershey's Kisses. Remove the white paper from each Kiss. Carefully pull out the little paper tab from each Hershey's Kiss. Do not unwrap the candy, however; if the foil comes undone, twist it back together. It's okay if the paper rips--just make sure that it's not visible on the actual Kiss. Secure two Hershey's Kisses together to make a rosebud. Place a glue dot or a piece of double-sided tape on the bottom of a Hershey's kiss. Place another Hershey's Kiss on top to make a diamond or rosebud shape. Repeat this step for the rest of the Kisses. Use the same color of Hershey's kisses for each rosebud. Glue dots are an item used in scrapbooking; they come on a strip, like tape. Do not use actual glue for this. Cut cellophane into 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) squares. Clear cellophane will work the best, but you can use iridescent cellophane as well. If your Hershey's Kisses were silver, consider using translucent red cellophane instead. Wrap a cellophane square over a rosebud like a lollipop. Pick up a Hershey's Kiss rosebud and choose an end to be the top. Place a cellophane square over it. Make sure that it's centered, then pull the ends together at the opposite end, like a lollipop. Do just one rosebud for now. Wrap the cellophane around a skewer or lollipop stick. Hold the rosebud by the bottom with one hand, keeping the wrapped cellophane together. Use your other hand to slide the tip of the skewer or lollipop stick into the cellophane. Twist the cellophane around the stick. Do not press the stick into the chocolate. If you are using lollipop sticks, make sure that you use the longest kind you can find, otherwise they will be too short. You can also use florist sticks or short, thin dowels. Secure the cellophane with green florist's tape. Begin wrapping the tape around the cellophane at the base of the rosebud. Gently tug down on the cellophane until the rosebud stands up on the tip of the stick. Continue wrapping it past the twisted cellophane. Wrap the rest of the stick with green florist's tape. Continue winding the tape down the length of the stick. Overlap each row slightly so that no gaps show. When you reach the bottom of the stick, tear the tape off, and press it tightly against the stick. Consider adding silk 1 to 2 rose leaves; tuck them against the stick while wrapping it. You can buy packs of fake rose leaves from the bridal section at an arts and crafts store. Make more Hershey's Kiss roses, then arrange your bouquet. Finish all of the roses first. Fill a vase with some vase filler, then stick the roses inside. You can include some real or fake roses as well. Finish the look off by wrapping a ribbon around the vase. If you add real roses, tuck a matching Hershey's Kiss inside it. For a fancier rose, wrap some ribbon around the stem, like a candy cane. Making a Paper Cut-Out Bouquet Cut flower shapes onto colored cardstock. Use a large, flower-shaped cookie cutter to trace flower shapes onto colorful cardstock. Cut the shapes out with a pair of scissors when you are done. How many shapes you trace is up to you. Don't use construction paper. It won't be sturdy enough. If you can't find cardstock, use poster paper instead. You can draw simple flower shapes instead. You will need 5 to 6 petals for each flower. Make sure that they are big enough to hold your chocolates. Hot glue a green florist stick to the back of each flower. Draw a line of hot glue down the center of the flower, from top to bottom. Press the stick into the glue, so that it sticks out of the bottom of the flower. You want the stick supporting the entire back of the flower, otherwise it will flop over. If you don't have hot glue, you can use tape instead. If you can't find green florist sticks, get some short, thin dowels or wooden skewers, and paint them green instead. Place a piece of double-sided tape onto each petal and flower center. You can also use a glue dot instead. You can find rolls of glue dots in an arts and crafts store. Do not use actual glue for this. Press a small, wrapped chocolate onto each petal and flower center. Use a small chocolate that is no larger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) Small, chocolate squares work the best for this. Use the same color for each petal, and a different color for the center. You can match the color of the chocolates to the paper, or you can use a different color. Consider adding some paper leaves to the sticks. You don't really have to do this, but it will make the flowers look more interesting. Cut some leaf shapes out of green cardstock, then glue 1 to 2 leaves to the center of each stem. Place a piece of floral foam into a vase. If you need to, use a serrated knife to trim the foam down so that it fits into the vase. If you can't find floral foam, you can use vase filler or regular Styrofoam instead. Stick the flowers into the foam. Arrange the flowers in staggered rows. Push the ones in the first row as far down into the foam as you can, and the ones in the last row just a little bit. This will give your bouquet some varieties in height. Making a Tissue Paper Bouquet Stack three chocolate squares together. Use small, foil-wrapped chocolates, such as Dove, that are no bigger than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). They can be different colors/flavors, but they need to be the same shape and size. You can use Hershey's Kisses for this method. Simply stack two Kisses together with the bottom ends together. You can use two round chocolates, such as Ferrero Rocher or Lindor, instead. Cut a square out of cellophane. Clear cellophane will work the best, but you can use a colored one if your chocolates are wrapped in silver foil. The squares need to be big enough to wrap around your chocolate stack like a lollipop. Something between 3 and 4 inches (7.62 and 10.16 centimeters) should be enough. Wrap the chocolate stack in cellophane, like a lollipop. Place the cellophane on top of the chocolate stack. Wrap the ends around the sides of the chocolate stack, towards the bottom. Insert a wooden skewer and twist the cellophane shut. Slide the blunt end of a skewer between the cellophane and one side of the chocolate stack. Twist the cellophane around the wooden skewer to hold it in place. If you can't find a wooden skewer, you can use a florist stick, a long lollipop stick, or a short, thin dowel. Don't pierce the chocolates with the skewer. Secure the cellophane with green florist's tape. Begin wrapping the florist's tape around the base of the chocolate stack. Continue wrapping it around and past the twisted cellophane, onto the wooden skewer itself. Tear off the excess florist's tape. Don't wrap the entire skewer just yet. Cut a 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) square out of colored tissue paper. The tissue paper can be the same color as your chocolate, or it can be a different color. It should be solid-colored, however. Cut a square that measures 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) wide and 12 (30.48 centimeters) long. You can also use thin crepe paper instead. Fold the square in half, then turn down the corners. Fold the square in half first. Next, turn it so that the folded edge is facing away from you. Fold the top corners down to meet the bottom edge. Wrap the tissue paper around the chocolate stack. Place the chocolate stack on top of the tissue paper, right next to one of the narrow edges. Make sure that the top of the chocolate stack is just below the top edge of the folded tissue paper. Wrap and roll the chocolate stack towards the other narrow end. You can have the top of the chocolate aligned with the top of the tissue paper instead. Twist the bottom of the tissue paper. Once you are done rolling the flower, twist the excess tissue paper along the bottom edge around the stem, just like wrapping a lollipop. Secure the twisted tissue paper with a strip of green florist's tape, just like you did with the cellophane. Gently pull the top corner away from the bud for a more realistic touch. Consider cutting and folding leaf shapes out of green tissue paper. You don't have to do this, but it will give your flowers a nice touch. Cut the leaves out first, then fold them in half lengthwise to make a crease. Unfold the leaves when you are done. Add the leaf shapes to the bottom of the bud, if you made them. Place the leaves against the stem, just below the flower bud. Wrap a piece of green florist's tape around the bottom points of the leaves to secure them to the stem. Do not tear off the tape. Gently pull down on the leaves to reveal the flower bud. Wrap green florist's around the stem. Begin wrapping at the top of the stem, just below the bud, and finish wrapping at the bottom. Overlap each row slightly so that no gaps are showing. If you added the leaves, continue wrapping where you left off. Make more flowers, then arrange them as you like. Experiment with using different types of chocolates and colors of tissue paper. If you want to, you can even make some skewers with just leaves on them to use as filler.
