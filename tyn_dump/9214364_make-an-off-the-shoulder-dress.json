Use the markings on your dress and shoulder fabric pieces to cut them out. Remember to include the 2\u201d (5 cm) seam allowances for both pieces. The shoulder piece should look like a long wide strip of fabric. Adding the Elastic Mark the fabric. Take the width of your elastic and double it, and then add \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) for a seam allowance. For example, if your elastic is \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) wide, then your measurement would be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Mark your dress and shoulder fabric pieces this distance from the top edge.

Make sure to insert the correct elastic pieces into their corresponding pieces of fabric. For example, your shoulder elastic piece will need to go into the seam of the shoulder fabric piece.
