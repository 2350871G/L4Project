Add 2 tablespoons (34 g) of Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons (2 g) of paprika, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste to the meat. Use clean hands to gently mix the beef with the seasonings until they are thoroughly combined. Be careful not to overwork the ground beef when you\u2019re mixing it. That can result in tough burgers.
