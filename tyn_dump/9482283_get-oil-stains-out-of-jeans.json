This may help remove excess oil that hasn\u2019t yet set into the stain. Do this as soon as possible after the oil comes in contact with your jeans. Cover the stain in baking powder. After you\u2019ve blotted up the excess, sprinkle baking powder onto the entire oil stain so that it\u2019s completely covered. Lay your jeans on a flat surface and leave them alone for at least 1 hour. If the baking powder is a yellowish color, then it likely effectively pulled at least some of the oil out of your jeans. Sprinkle cornstarch onto the stain if you don\u2019t have baking powder. Brush off the baking powder or cornstarch. Once the baking powder or cornstarch has been sitting on the stain for at least an hour, gently brush off as much of it as you can. You can do this with a damp sponge or rag, but it may be more effective to brush the baking powder or cornstarch off with a large, fluffy makeup brush. Pre-Treating the Oil Stain Spray your oil stain with WD-40. Make sure that the spraying straw is attached to your WD-40 before you use it so that you can be in control of the application. Spray the WD-40 all over the stained area. Then, let it sit for 15-30 minutes. Use hairspray if you don\u2019t have WD-40. Hairspray can be applied in the same way that WD-40 is applied to help remove a good portion of the oil stain. Aim the can nozzle at the oily spots and press down to release the hairspray until the stains are completely coated. Leave your jeans alone for a few minutes. Cover the stain in dish washing liquid. Because it\u2019s made to cut through grease on your dishes, a dish washing liquid, such as Dawn, can help to remove oil from your jeans. Simply squirt the liquid onto all of the affected areas. Cover the stain with shampoo if you don\u2019t have dish soap. Many shampoos, especially those made for people with oily hair, strip out natural oils in order to give the hair a cleaner appearance. Completely cover the stained area in shampoo to try to strip the oil out of your jeans. Scrub the area with a toothbrush. With either the dish soap or the shampoo still on the stain, scrub at the area to remove as much as the oil as you can. Move the toothbrush in circular motions as you do this. Rinse the area with hot water. After scrubbing, take your jeans to the sink or tub and run some hot water. Hold the jeans underneath the water and rinse off the stained area until all of the suds are gone. Washing Your Jeans Put your jeans, detergent, and vinegar into the washing machine. Toss your jeans into the washing machine and add in your regular laundry detergent. Then, measure out \u20442 cup (120 ml) of white vinegar and pour it into the washing machine. The vinegar should help to pull out any oil that remains in the jeans. Wash your jeans in hot water. While some stains are better removed with cold water, you\u2019re much more likely to get rid of your oil stains if the water is hot. Set the water temperature to hot on your washing machine and press \u201cStart.\u201d Hang your jeans out to dry. Tumble drying your jeans in the dryer will set in any remaining stains. This will make it much more difficult to get the oil out. After the washing cycle is done, remove your jeans from the washing machine and hang them out on a clothesline or drying rack. Repeat the process if necessary. After your jeans are done drying, take a close look at the area that was stained. If you notice that the area is still stained, repeat the process.
