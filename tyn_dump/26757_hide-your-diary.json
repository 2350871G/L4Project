        "You don\u2019t want to damage the floor.",
        "Protecting Your Diary at School Keep your diary in a notebook to blend in with your school supplies.",
        "Everyone will think you\u2019re just writing down what the teacher is saying when really you\u2019re writing in your diary.",
        "Choose a very plain notebook or composition book so it\u2019s not noticeable among your other books.",
        "If you have a set of matching notebooks, use a similar one for your diary.",
        "For example, if all your notebooks are cat-themed, don\u2019t make your diary a neon striped notebook.",
        "Go with another cat-themed one.",
        "You can even fill the first couple pages with fake notes so if someone opens it, they\u2019ll think it\u2019s just your science notebook, for instance.",
        "Disguise your diary with a boring book cover so no one wants to read it.",
        "Pick the dullest, most uninteresting book you have that also has a removable cover.",
        "Remove the cover and wrap it around your diary.",
        "Make sure your diary is the same size of the original book so that the cover fits perfectly and doesn\u2019t look misplaced.",
        "Good options for boring covers are old textbooks or classic novels that most of your classmates wouldn\u2019t want to read.",
        "Pick a book that\u2019s realistic for you to be carrying around if you\u2019re taking it to school.",
        "For instance, your dad\u2019s book on how to fix plumbing problems might be super dull, but your friends will probably ask why you have it, drawing unwanted attention to your diary.",
        "Make a fake diary if you want your friends to stop trying to find yours.",
        "Trick nosy friends by creating a pretend diary.",
        "Keep it somewhere that they can see it, like on your desk, so they think they\u2019ve found the real deal and won\u2019t look for your actual diary.",
        "Design your fake diary to look as realistic as possible.",
        "You can even write \u201cMy Diary\u201d on the front.",
        "Write a few pretend entries in your fake diary so it\u2019s convincing if they open it up.",
        "Of course, don\u2019t include any real secrets though!",
        "Making a Secure Electronic Diary Keep your diary on your personal laptop so no one else can get to it.",
        "Never keep your diary on a public computer or online where someone could find it.",
        "The best spot is on the desktop of your laptop.",
        "If your parents or siblings use your laptop sometimes, set up a different login for them.",
        "You can create a guest login so they don't have access to your personal files.",
        "Save your file under a fake name in a rarely used folder.",
        "Give your diary a name that disguises what it actually is.",
        "Then save it in a folder that no one would ever look in, like the system folder under the \u201cMy Computer\u201d tab.",
        "For example, instead of naming your file \"My Diary,\" name it something like \u201cBiology Homework\u201d instead.",
        "On some computers, you can hide entire folders, too.",
        "Right-click on the folder, then select \"Properties.\"",
        "There will be a box labeled \"Hidden\" or something similar that you can check.",
        "Now, nobody can see the folder.",
        "Protect your diary with a strong password.",
        "Set the privacy controls on your laptop so a password is required for you to log into the computer.",
        "If you type your diary in a Microsoft Word document, you can password-protect that specific file, too.",
        "To password-protect a document, click \u201cPreferences\u201d on the main menu, then \u201cPersonal Settings\u201d followed by \u201cSecurity.\u201d Select \u201cPassword to Open\u201d to require someone to know the password to even open the file.",
        "How to Pick a Super Safe Password\nMake it longer than 12 characters.",
        "Don't use personal information, like your name, birthday, or address.",
        "Avoid commonly-used numbers and words, like \"1234\" or the word \"password.\"",
        "You can turn an entire sentence into a strong password.",
        "For instance, \"Eating cheese is delicious\" becomes \"eatingcheeseisdelicious.\"",
        "Add special characters, numbers, and different capitalization.",
        "Keeping Your Diary a Secret Avoid writing in your diary when there are other people around.",
        "Try not to let anyone see you writing in your diary.",
        "If they do, they\u2019ll know you have one and will probably want to read it or attempt to find it when you\u2019re not looking.",
        "Only take out your diary when you\u2019re completely alone, just to be safe.",
        "If your diary is disguised, like in a notebook, you can write in it around other people as long as no one is close enough to see what you\u2019re writing.",
        "When you're at home, wait until your parents leave or until everyone else goes to bed before you break out your diary.",
        "Act natural if someone sees you with it so they don't get suspicious.",
        "If you get caught with your diary or writing in it, don\u2019t panic.",
        "Pretend like it\u2019s just any old book, like a notebook for school.",
        "Calmly close it, tuck it away, and change the conversation.",
        "If someone asks what you\u2019re doing, say something casual like, \u201cOh, nothing, just finishing up algebra homework for tomorrow.",
        "Cute shirt!",
        "Where did you get it?\u201d\nAvoid acting nervous, tripping over your words, or fidgeting.",
        "These are all signs you\u2019re lying and the other person will likely suspect you\u2019re hiding something.",
        "Write in a secret code so no one can read it except you.",
        "This will make writing in your diary more complicated but adds another level of protection in case anyone finds it.",
        "Invent your own code or language to write in by mixing up letters or even including numbers.",
        "Keep a key, which explains how to read the code, somewhere safe, like in a locked drawer.",
        "One example of a code is the reverse alphabet.",
        "\u201cA\u201d is now \u201cZ,\u201d \u201cB\u201d is now \u201cY,\u201d \u201cC\u201d is now \u201cX,\u201d and so on.",
        "So for instance, you\u2019d write \u201cboy\u201d as \u201cylb\u201d or \u201clove\u201d as \u201colev.\u201d\nIf you\u2019re fluent in a language other than your native one, you can write in that.",
        "For example, if all of your friends speak English but you\u2019re also fluent in Spanish, keep your diary in Spanish.",
        "But remember, some friends may use translation services like Google Translate to find out what\u2019s written in your diary.",
        "A good place to keep your key is on your phone in the notes app.",
        "Don\u2019t write the key in your diary because, if someone finds your diary, they\u2019ll then be able to translate everything."
