Most bike pedals require either a 6mm or 8mm hex key to install and remove the pedals. Popular crank brands that require a hex key include Shimano, Look, and Speedplay.

You can purchase a 15mm pedal spanner, which is specifically used for bike repairs, or you can use a standard 15mm wrench to remove your pedals. Taking the Pedals off with a Hex Key Fit a 6mm and 8mm hex key into the fitting to see which one you need. If you're unsure of which sized hex key you need, figure it out by inserting both a 6mm and 8mm hex key into the hex fitting on the end of the crank arm.

Once you set the bike to a high gear, rotate the pedals a few times so that the chain shifts to the largest ring. This will give you more room and will make it easier to remove the pedals. If your bike doesn't have different gears, skip this step. Lift up the back wheel on the bike. Hang your bike from a bike rack or you can hang the saddle on the edge of a table or workbench while you remove the pedals. Lifting up the back wheel as you work will keep the bike still even if you pedal the bike forward or rotate the crank. This will make removing the pedals with a wrench much easier.
