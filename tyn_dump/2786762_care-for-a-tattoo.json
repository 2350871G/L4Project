Fresh tattoos are more prone to bacteria and getting infected since they\u2019re open skin.

Wait at least 1 hour after getting your tattoo and until you have time to wash it. When you\u2019re ready, slowly peel the wrapping off the tattoo and throw it away. It\u2019s normal if you see beads of ink on the surface of your skin since it will ooze blood, ink, and plasma to form scabs. If the bandage or plastic sticks to your skin, do not try and rip it off. Wet the wrapping with lukewarm water until you can peel it off. If you have plastic wrap over your tattoo, take it off as soon as you\u2019re able to since it restricts air flow and will prevent your tattoo from healing quickly.
