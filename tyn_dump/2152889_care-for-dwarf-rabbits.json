Your rabbit will most likely be jumpy, but may be willing to sit still on your lap after developing trust over time. When you do hold your rabbit, comfort it by supporting its back legs in one hand and softly pressing it against your chest with the other. Never pick your rabbit up by its ears. Put your hands under the rabbit\u2019s belly and hindquarters when you pick it up. Make sure you\u2019re supporting the hindquarters so that the rabbit doesn\u2019t kick out. It\u2019s natural for the rabbit to kick its legs out when you try to pick it up, but this motion can hurt the bunny\u2019s spine, potentially causing a serious injury. Always keep one hand under your rabbit\u2019s hindquarters when you\u2019re holding it. Hold your rabbit close to your body so it feels safe. Remember, your rabbit is tiny and is naturally fearful. It\u2019s likely going to be scared if you\u2019re holding it off the ground. Keeping it pressed close to your body can help your rabbit feel safer, making it less likely to try to jump away from you.Tip: Don\u2019t try to pick up your rabbit until you know it trusts you. If your rabbit is afraid, its instincts will tell it to do anything to get away, even if it might get hurt in the process. Squat down close to the ground to put your rabbit down. Don\u2019t just reach down with your arms, as your rabbit may get very scared during the descent. Keep your rabbit close to your body as you squat down toward the floor. Then, slowly extend your arms down and set your rabbit safely on the floor. Avoid letting your rabbit jump out of your arms, even from a low height. This increases the risk that your bunny may get injured. Grooming Your Dwarf Rabbit Check your rabbit\u2019s backside daily to make sure it\u2019s clean. Look for urine and feces stuck to your bunny\u2019s fur, which can lead to flies laying eggs and the eggs hatching into maggots, especially when the weather is warm. If you notice any, use a damp rag to wipe your pet clean. Then, check your rabbit\u2019s litter box to make sure it doesn\u2019t need changing. If you see any soft poop or diarrhea, take your rabbit to the vet to make sure it\u2019s not ill. Brush your dwarf rabbit\u2019s fur 2-3 times a week with a soft-bristled brush. Different types of dwarf rabbits have different types of fur, so brushing may be optional or very important, depending on your dwarf rabbit\u2019s fur. If your dwarf rabbit is longhaired, you\u2019ll need to keep it clean and brush out the tangles regularly to protect your rabbit from catching diseases. If your rabbit\u2019s fur is shorter, you should still brush it for comforting and bonding purposes. Brushing your rabbit a few times a week removes shed fur, which prevents your rabbit from ingesting the fur. Use a comb to detangle problem areas. Clean your rabbit\u2019s ears weekly by removing debris and wiping them clean. Check the ears for debris, like hay or bedding. Gently remove any debris that you find using your fingers or a fine comb. Then, use a clean, damp towel to gently wipe the inside and outside of the ear. Finally, dry the ear with a soft, clean cloth. If you notice any debris in your rabbit\u2019s ear in between cleanings, remove it promptly. Cut your rabbit\u2019s nails. Use sharp nail clippers specifically for rabbits to cut your dwarf rabbit\u2019s nails when they get long. Wrap the rabbit in a towel while you cut so that you can keep a good hold on it if it gets squirmy. If you\u2019re unsure about how to go about cutting or how much to cut, make an appointment to have your vet do it. Your rabbit can get seriously hurt if you try to cut its nails without being educated on how to do so. Ask your vet to show you how before attempting to do it yourself. Never attempt to cut your rabbit\u2019s teeth if they get too long. You can severely injure your rabbit if you trim them too far. Take your rabbit to your veterinarian and they can safely file them down using a special burr. Entertaining Your Dwarf Rabbit Give your bunny non-toxic rabbit toys, bird toys, or hard plastic baby toys. Rabbits are very smart, so they get bored easily. Help your bunny beat boredom by giving it a variety of fun toys, such as rattles, plastic keys, and plastic balls. Look for toys that it can move around its cage, as well as toys that hang off the top or sides of the cage. Keep sets of toys so that you can rotate them weekly. That way, your rabbit always has something new and different to play with, but you don\u2019t have to keep buying toys. Offer your rabbit wooden toys to chew on. Your bunny\u2019s teeth will be constantly growing, so it will naturally want to gnaw on something to wear down its teeth. Non-toxic wood toys are a great solution to this issue, as your rabbit can have fun while also caring for its teeth. Look for wood toys at your local pet store or online. Buy wood that\u2019s labeled for use with small animals to make sure it\u2019s safe for your rabbit. Give your rabbit cardboard tubes and boxes to tear up. Bunnies love to rip up cardboard, so you can give your pet hours of entertainment by recycling paper towel rolls and boxes. You can fill a cardboard toilet paper tube with hay or simply just place the tube in the cage and let your dwarf rabbit have a go at it. You can also make a rabbit hideaway by cutting the bottom off of a cardboard box and cutting doors and windows. Remove old pieces of cardboard when they start to get soiled. Make a rice filled egg. Fill a plastic Easter egg with dry rice, and then hot glue it shut. Give the egg to your dwarf rabbit, who will love to rattle it around. However, you might want to remove the toy at night, since your rabbit will likely keep you up all night rattling the egg. Desexing Your Rabbit Recognize the benefits of getting your rabbit spayed or neutered. Even if you only have one rabbit, getting it fixed can improve the health and personality of your bunny. If you keep more than one rabbit, it\u2019s essential that they each be desexed. Getting your rabbit desexed provides the following benefits:\nReduces the risk of certain cancers, especially reproductive cancers\nDecreases aggression\nMakes the rabbit a better companion\nMakes litter training easier\nEliminates spraying in male rabbits\nAllows rabbits to safely live in pairs\nReduces unwanted littersTip: Unless you\u2019re planning on breeding dwarf rabbits, it\u2019s best to get them desexed. This helps them to have a calmer temperament overall and also makes them less susceptible to many diseases. The biggest reason to have female rabbits desexed is to prevent uterine cancer, which is very common in females. Neuter a male dwarf rabbit at as early as 8 to 12 weeks of age. Your bunny\u2019s testicles will start descend when it\u2019s around 2- to 3-months-old. At this point, you can take it to the vet to get neutered. Desexing it early will help prevent your rabbit from developing aggressive, territorial behaviors, like biting, growling, or spraying. Separate male and female rabbits once the testicles start to descend. Don\u2019t put them back together until the male has healed from his neutering. Spay a female dwarf rabbit between 4 and 8 months of age. Your female rabbit will start to reach sexual maturity at 4 months. However, your vet may wait until your rabbit is 6 months old to make the surgery safer. Discuss the benefits of waiting with your vet to help you make the right decision for your pet. Getting Veterinary Care Find a small animal vet to care for your rabbit. Your bunny has different needs than a cat or a dog, so you need a vet who knows how to care for rabbits. Look for a vet that advertises as a small animal vet, as they will have the specialized skills necessary to treat rabbits. Additionally, ask the vet about their education and experience to make sure they have a background in treating bunnies. Don\u2019t feel uncomfortable asking questions. Your vet loves animals, too, so they\u2019ll understand that you want to find the best possible vet for your beloved pet. Get your rabbit vaccinated. Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus is a potentially fatal virus that has been introduced to different areas to keep the rabbit population from getting out of control. To ensure that your dwarf rabbit won\u2019t get this virus, get it vaccinated when it\u2019s 4 weeks old and then every 6 months for the rest of its life. Rid your rabbit of parasites. The only parasites that rabbits tend to get are fleas and mites/lice. If you think your rabbit may have fleas, store-bought over-the-counter flea medications such as Advantage or Revolution are easy to use and will fix the issue. If your rabbit is scratching its ears frequently or has dry skin around the shoulder area, it may have mites. Take your rabbit to the vet to get treatment for mites. Check with your vet before you give your rabbit any type of medication. They can advise you of the proper dosing. If you give your pet too much medication, it can cause harmful consequences. Your dwarf rabbit is much more likely to get fleas if you have other pets as well, such as dogs or cats that get the fleas first.",
