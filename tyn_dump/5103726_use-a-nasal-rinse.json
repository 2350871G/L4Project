Look for a product labeled as a \"nasal rinse,\" \"sinus rinse,\" or for \"nasal irrigation.\" They are typically available at pharmacies but can be found in some grocery and big box stores as well. Most store-bought nasal rinse products are made up almost exclusively of saline. Saline is a combination of purified water and salt. Read and follow the directions on the packaging. These directions should include how to do the nasal rinse and how often you can do it. Some store-bought nasal rinse products require that you add purified or boiled and cooled water to the applicator. If your product says to do this, be sure to do it and don't simply add tap water. Use purified bottled water from an unopened bottle, or boil some tap water and let it cool if bottled water is unavailable."
