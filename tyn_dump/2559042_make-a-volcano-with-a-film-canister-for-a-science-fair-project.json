Use the modeling clay to build a volcano structure. You can make the volcano as large as you want. The taller your volcano is the more surface your lava will have to flow down. Push the canister into the tip of the volcano. Make sure that you have removed the lid and push it down with the open side facing up. Make the top of the canister flush with the top of the volcano. Do not pack any clay into the center of the canister. You need to leave the canister empty. Fill the volcano with baking soda. Pour the baking soda that you have set off to the side into the canister. This will be the first reactant in the center of your volcano. Be careful not to get any baking soda in your eyes. Use protective eye gear. Pour the vinegar into the volcano. Using the colored white vinegar that you have set off to the side, pour the vinegar into the volcano\u2019s center. The vinegar will react with the baking soda and cause an \u201ceruption\u201d. Stand back as the volcano erupts. While it is not a dangerous reaction, it will be messy.
