        "The trial will revolve around whether the promissory note is valid and whether the defendant is justified in not paying back the debt.",
        "Unless you're in small claims court, you'll need to do quite a bit of work before your trial date approaches.",
        "You'll swap documents in a process called \u201cdiscovery.\u201d\nYou may need to have a settlement conference.",
        "Courts hope parties can settle their disputes so a trial becomes unnecessary.",
        "You can file a motion for summary judgment.",
        "In this motion, you argue you should win without going to trial because no set of facts exists that will allow the debtor to prevail.",
        "Go to court.",
        "Each side can call witnesses and introduce documents.",
        "You'll want to introduce the promissory note and testify about the debtor's history of payment.",
        "Most small claims courts don't have juries, so a judge will likely decide who wins.",
        "Enforce your judgment.",
        "If you win, you get a piece of paper from the court.",
        "Now you need to enforce it.",
        "The debtor can voluntarily pay you, or you might need to take other action.",
        "Consider your options:\nYou can garnish the debtor's wages or bank accounts.",
        "You might be able to have the sheriff seize and sell personal property such as boats, cars, jewelry, etc.",
        "You will get some of the proceeds from the sale.",
        "You can also put a lien on real estate, such as the debtor's home.",
        "Depending on where you live, you might be able to force a sale of the property.",
        "At a minimum, you can receive payment if the debtor sells the house or refinances.",
        "Hiring a Collection Agency Find a reputable collection agency.",
        "You can hire a certified member of the Commercial Collection Agency Association.",
        "These agencies have extensive experience and adhere to state and federal collection laws.",
        "Also check whether anyone has complained to the Better Business Bureau about the collection agency.",
        "Confirm they're licensed.",
        "Collection agencies should be licensed by the state where they are collecting the debt.",
        "Ask for the license number and double check by calling the state's licensing agency.",
        "States usually require that debt collectors be bonded and have insurance, so ask for proof of that as well.",
        "Check fees.",
        "Generally, collection agencies charge contingency fees.",
        "This means they only get a fee if they collect money, and they take a percent off the top.",
        "Typically, an agency will take 15-20% of the amount collected.",
        "Get the fee agreement in writing.",
        "For example, an agency with a 20% contingency fee keeps $2,000 of every $10,000 collected.",
        "Because agencies work on contingency, some debts might be too small for them to take on.",
        "Call and check.",
        "Ask how they find debtors.",
        "The debtor might have skipped town after stopping payment on your debt.",
        "If so, the collection agency should tell you how they will find them.",
        "For example, they might employ skip tracing, which involves using special databases to track down the debtor.",
        "Sign a contract.",
        "Make sure to get the agreement in writing.",
        "Don't rely on oral agreements, and insist all key terms are included in the contract.",
        "If you have a dispute with the collection agency, then the terms of your contract control.",
        "Share information with the agency.",
        "You'll speed up the collection efforts if you share helpful information, such as the following:\nThe debtor's name and address, including any aliases.",
        "The debtor's telephone number and email address.",
        "Whether the debtor has responded to your efforts to collect on the debt.",
        "A copy of the promissory note."
