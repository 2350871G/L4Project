For better results, use a plastic bin with high walls. This will make clean-up easier. If you want to make thicker slime, use 2\u00bd cups (595 mL) of warm water instead. Do not use borax; it is not the same thing. Soap flakes are simply grated pieces of soap and safe to handle with your bare hands. Borax isn't."
