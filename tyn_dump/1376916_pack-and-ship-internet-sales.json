Wrap it 2 or 3 times around the items you are shipping. Use heavy-duty packing tape to secure the bubble wrap to the gift. The tape on the bubble wrap secures the item and prevents it from moving around and breaking when it is in transit to its destination. Open the cardboard box or box you will use to send the fragile item(s). Place packing peanuts at the bottom of the shipping box. Make sure you have at least 2 inches (5 cm) worth of packing peanuts to support the bottom of the item. Place the item inside the box. Now take more packing peanuts and fill the remaining space inside the box with packing peanuts. Secure the lid shut with heavy-duty packing tape. Press the right and left side flaps down. Place 3 strips horizontally across the lid, where the right and left sides meet. Take the packing tape and place 3 more strips vertically, over the lid, where the right and left sides meet.  Method 2 Pack small items using bubble mailers. Wrap small items, such as jewelry, CDs and makeup with tissue paper or bubble wrap sleeves. Tape the ends with scotch tape. The tape helps to secure the item placed inside the bubble wrap. Place the item inside a bubble mailer. Provide a secure fit by using a bubble mailer that is close in size to the item you are mailing. Method 3 Fold shirts neatly. Place tissue paper around the shirt. Secure the left and right folds in the center with tape. Bring the top and bottom folds in the middle. Secure this with tape. Use medium-sized zip lock bags to keep shirts secure while in transit. The zip lock bags also prevent water or other substances from coming into contact with the merchandise inside the bag. Place the wrapped shirt inside a polyurethane bag. Remove the film that covers the adhesive at the top of the bag. Fold the top of the bag over and secure it shut by pressing down the adhesive on the polyurethane bag.
