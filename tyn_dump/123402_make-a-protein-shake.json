Add 1 tablespoon of almonds, 1 tablespoon of sugar-free maple syrup, vanilla extract, and low-fat Greek yogurt to get a delicious soy almond shake. If you're lactose intolerant, make sure the yogurt is lactose-free. If you love fruit, use a fruit flavored whey protein or dried fruit powder.

Try almond milk instead of almonds, and chocolate powder instead of chocolate. You can also buy fruit powder, which is similar to your protein powder. Instead of a whey protein powder, you can use fruit powder which contains all the nutrients of fruit. If you opt for fruit powder, mix it in like you would your protein powder, after you add your juice or milk. The easiest way to mix all your protein powder is to pour a little in at a time, stir, and then pour more. By adding a little protein at a time there is less powder that has to absorb at once. Once you\u2019ve stirred in all your powder, screw the lid of your bottle on tightly and shake for 10 to 15 seconds.
