        "You could paint the person\u2019s name on top of a stunning multi-colored background, or make a dreamy sky-scape with clouds, a sun, and birds.",
        "The options are endless.",
        "This is a great way to use a skill of yours to show someone gratitude.",
        "If you\u2019re going to mail the card, make sure the paper is completely dry before you put it into an envelope.",
        "Craft a rustic card with twine and brown craft paper.",
        "This kind of card is simple to make.",
        "All you need is some brown craft paper, some twine, and a white or black marker.",
        "Fold the paper in half, and write \u201cthank you\u201d across the front with the white or black marker (white works well on dark-brown paper, whereas black will look better on light-brown paper).",
        "Make a small bow out of 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of twine, and use a glue gun to secure it to the top corner of the card.",
        "You can, of course, get even more creative with rustic cards.",
        "For example, include the person\u2019s name on the front of the card, add a cut-out flower or some other design, or create lines across the top half of the card by gluing down strands of twine.",
        "Decorating the Card Cut paper with scalloped shears to make decorative edges.",
        "Cut all the edges of the actual card itself to make its edges into a different shape, or use them to make other parts of the card look more unique.",
        "For example, if you have a square of white paper to glue to the card to write your message in, cut it out with the scalloped shears\u2014it\u2019ll look a little fancier than straight edges would.",
        "There are lots of differently-patterned scissors you can use.",
        "Browse the options at your local craft store to find a pair to add to your crafting supplies.",
        "Decorate with stamps to add an extra design element to your card.",
        "You can buy stamps from your local craft store or from an online store, and there are tons of different styles available.",
        "Look for ones that say \u201cthank you,\u201d or pick your favorite designs, like leaves, flowers, or other objects you can use to decorate your card.",
        "Experiment with different colors of ink.",
        "For example, white ink would really look great on black or dark blue paper, whereas dark green ink could look really classy on a cream-colored card.",
        "Add dimension to your card with paper cutouts.",
        "Layering paper is a great way to create visual depth.",
        "Cut out several different sizes of colored paper, like a large square, a medium-sized square, and a small circle, then paste them on top of each other on the front of the card so that they create multiple borders.",
        "You can get really creative and use different colors, sizes, and types of paper.",
        "Glue on buttons or gems for a whimsical touch.",
        "You can create a pattern or border out of buttons or gems, or use them to accent a design already on the card.",
        "Use liquid-glue or non-liquid adhesive to secure the objects to your card.",
        "just make sure you give them enough time to dry so they stay securely in place.",
        "For example, if your card has flowers on it, you could glue a button to the center of each flower.",
        "Use leftover scraps of ribbon to make a textured card.",
        "Use one color of ribbon, or use multiple colors and patterns depending on what you have available.",
        "Tie a bow and glue it to the top of the card, or use strips of ribbon to make a colorful background across the entire body of the card.",
        "This is a nice way to repurpose ribbon leftover from other crafts or even from gifts you\u2019ve received.",
        "Writing a Thank You Note Use your best handwriting or calligraphy.",
        "If you have a hard time writing legibly, try to slow down and take care when writing out your thank you message.",
        "Use a pen or marker that won\u2019t smudge or smear across the page.",
        "Permanent markers work well, and gel pens dry faster and are less likely to smudge than ballpoint pens.",
        "If your card is made with dark paper, cut out a lighter-colored piece of paper to glue to the inside of the card.",
        "That way, you can write your message without worrying if it will be visible or not.",
        "Include a salutation and the person\u2019s name on the inside of the card.",
        "Regardless of what you designed or wrote on the front of the card, the inside message should still include some kind of greeting, as well as the recipient\u2019s name.",
        "Double-check that you\u2019re spelling the person\u2019s name correctly.",
        "For the greeting, you could write:\n\u201cDear John,\u201d\n\u201cKelly, thank you,\u201d\n\u201cHello, Mrs. Smith,\u201d\n\u201cGreetings, Susan,\u201d\nOr, just write the person\u2019s name if that feels more natural to you.",
        "Thank the person for what they did or gave specifically.",
        "You don\u2019t need to exaggerate, ramble, or overly thank someone.",
        "Just a simple line or two will do.",
        "And don\u2019t hesitate to thank people for small things, too, like a homemade meal or someone attending an event or performance you were in.",
        "Everyone likes being appreciated!",
        "For example, write something like, \u201cThank you so much for inviting me and Jason over for a meal.",
        "It was so nice to relax and connect with you and Kate.\u201d\nOr write something like, \u201cThank you so much for the new set of bath towels.",
        "They look great in our cupboard and we were excited to replace our mismatched and worn-out set.\u201d\nThank someone who supported you by attending an event by saying something like, \u201cThank you so much for coming to my concert last Friday evening.",
        "It was so nice to look out and see a friendly face, and I really appreciate you taking the time to support me.\u201d Compliment the person or express good wishes for them.",
        "Whether you compliment their thoughtfulness or generosity or tell them you hope to see them soon, it\u2019s nice to end the note on an emotional upswing.",
        "This doesn\u2019t have to be a long, drawn-out sentiment.",
        "One line should be enough.",
        "For example, write something like, \u201cYour gift was so thoughtful.",
        "I look forward to seeing you at the next family reunion!\u201d\nOr, \u201cI hope this next season is good to you and your family.\u201d Sign your name to end the letter.",
        "If the gift was given to you and your family, have everyone sign their names to the bottom of the card.",
        "Whether you write \u201clove,\u201d or some other kind of sign-off note is up to you.",
        "You can try out different endings, like:\n\u201cWarmly,\u201d\n\u201cAll the best,\u201d\n\u201cKind regards,\u201d\n\u201cWith appreciation,\u201d\n\u201cThanks again.\u201d Mail or deliver the card with 1 to 2 weeks of the occasion.",
        "If you\u2019re mailing the card, make sure to seal it in an envelope, put enough postage on it, and write the address legibly across the front.",
        "For a hand-delivered card, either drop it into the person\u2019s mailbox or give it to them the next time you see them.",
        "If you can\u2019t get your thank you card out in the mail quickly, late is always better than never.",
        "You could even put in a note saying something like, \u201cI know this is a few weeks late, but I just wanted to send my appreciation.\u201d"
