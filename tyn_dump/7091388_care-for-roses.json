Cutting down the plant to its base stems will help encourage plentiful new growth. Some varieties may need more pruning, so always check the growing instructions for your breed of roses. Pruned roses may seem very bare, but this is necessary for the roses to grow new foliage and blossoms. Cut your roses back to about 18 inches (46 cm) tall or to live growth. How much you prune will depend on your climate. If a lot of live growth survived the winter, don\u2019t cut this away. However, you may need to chop it down close to the ground if there isn\u2019t much live growth. In some cases, your rose bush will die down to about 8 inches (20 cm) tall if the winter has been rough. Keep cutting until you've removed all of the dead parts of the roses. You can safely cut your rose bush down to about 6 inches (15 cm) tall if necessary. Remove any shoots that appear to come from the roots, not the stems. Cut the shoots at the ground level with your scissors or pruning shears. In many cases, these shoots are suckers that will take nutrients from the root system. This can weaken your rose bush. If you let these shoots grow, they\u2019ll put too much demand on the root system. It's best to do this before the new growing season starts. However, you can remove suckers during the growing season if you think they're weakening your plant. Trim your shrubs rather than cutting them back.

Signs that you need to repot your plant include soil that dries out too quickly, roots that are very compacted or protruding out of the drainage holes, and foliage that appears too big for the pot. Choose a new pot that allows at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) of space between the existing root ball and the sides of the pot. When in doubt, choose the bigger pot. Allow your plant to rest in a cool spot during the winter. Roses hibernate over the winter, even if you keep them inside. The leaves and stems will dry up, and the plant will stop producing buds. However, the plant isn\u2019t dead; it\u2019s just dormant. Water your plant when the soil feels completely dry during the winter. If you\u2019d like, you can move your plant to a garage or basement during the winter months. Keeping Cut Roses Fresh Remove the wrap around the bouquet as soon as possible. If your roses are wrapped in paper or plastic, take the wrap off as soon as you can. The wrap can cause the roses to wilt. If your roses don\u2019t have a wrap, you can skip this step. If your roses are already looking wilted, cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the end of the stem and soak the entire rose in a pan of warm water for about 20 minutes. The rose should revive after soaking. Cut the bottom 1 inch (2.5 cm) off of the stem so it can take up water. Fresh cuts will take up more water, so it\u2019s best to trim the stems right before you put them in a vase. Whenever you change the water, you\u2019ll need to trim the stems again. Otherwise, the roses won\u2019t take up as much water, making them wilt faster. Use a pair of sharp scissors to trim the stems. Add floral preservative to the water to extend their freshness. Many bouquets come with a floral preservative either attached to the flowers or already in the water. If yours didn\u2019t include a preservative, you can make your own. Mix 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of white vinegar, 1 tsp (5 g) of sugar, and .5 teaspoons (2.5 mL) of bleach to 4 cups (0.95 L) of water. Add it to your vase. If you change out your water, add more floral preservative. However, you don\u2019t need to add more preservative every time you add water. Check the water level every day and add more water as necessary. Fresh, clean water will keep the flowers from wilting. Make sure all of the stems are below the waterline. If necessary, add more water. If the water is cloudy, pour out the water and replace it with fresh water. When you change your water, cut another 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the bottom of the stem. Your flowers will last longer if you change the water every other day, adding floral preservative each time. Cut the stems at least .25 inches (0.64 cm) each time you change the water. Make sure the water is free of leaves. Cut away leaves that are below the waterline in the vase. Pick loose leaves out of the water to prevent them from decaying. Decayed leaves will make the roses wilt faster. Check the water daily to make sure leaves haven\u2019t fallen into it. Put your roses in a cool spot out of direct sunlight. Cool temperatures will extend the life of your cut flowers. On the other hand, light and heat will make them wilt sooner. Don\u2019t put the roses directly under a draft, as it may cause the flower to wilt faster. If you put your flowers in the refrigerator while you\u2019re not home, they\u2019ll live even longer. However, don\u2019t put them around rotting fruit, especially apples.",
