You can rub about a teaspoon of butter on the pan before you use it, as it will add an extra layer of depth to the flavor of the cake. You can also use shortening or dab just enough vegetable or coconut oil to evenly cover the pan. Both of these options will prevent your cake from sticking to the pan. Try not to use cooking sprays to grease your pan, if possible. These are convenient, but areas where the heat doesn\u2019t burn the spray off can become sticky or pasty over time, meaning you\u2019ll have to replace your pan sooner rather than later. Coat the greased cake pan with a couple of spoonfuls of flour, enough to create a thin dusting which will prevent the grease from absorbing into the batter when the cake is baking."
