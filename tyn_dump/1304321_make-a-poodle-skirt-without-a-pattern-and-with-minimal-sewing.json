First, you will need to measure your waist to get your skirt's waist size. Use a tape measure and then write down the measurement. Then, add two inches or 5.08 centimeters to this measurement. For example, if the waist measurement is 30 inches, the skirt's waist will need to be 32 inches. You are making the skirt's waist a little bit larger because you will need to bunch up the material."

Take a long piece of string and tie it around a pen. Then, measure the end of the string extending from the pen. It will need to be the same length as your radius. For example, if your radius is 3.34 inches, then measure the string to this length. Tie a knot, do not cut as cutting the string will leave a frayed edge that the pin will instantly slip out of. This way you can use ONE string with three knots:  one knot to pin the string to the fold of the fabric, a second knot for the waistline circle, and third knot for the hemline circle. Waist and hemline knots must be at correct distance from center-top pin. Then, pin the end of the string to the mark you made in the felt. You will be using the pen and string like a compass to draw your circles. You might need to anchor the pin to the table with tape to keep it from dragging the fabric around as you draw the half-circles."
