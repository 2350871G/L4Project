This may not be needed but it's nice to neaten the end result. Done. The foam mousepad is now ready for immediate use. Oilcloth and foam mousepad Cut a standard mousepad size from the foam sheet. You can make it larger or smaller if preferred, although the standard size will be around 8.5\" x 8\". Use the ruler and pencil to measure and mark before cutting. Measure the same shape for the oilcloth. Cut the oilcloth to the same size. Go outdoors or in a well-ventilated are for gluing the pieces together. Lay down a protective cover before spraying. Use adhesive spray the foam piece with the multi-purpose adhesive.  Press the back of the oilcloth onto the foam piece. Take care to smooth it out and remove any wrinkles as quickly as possible.
