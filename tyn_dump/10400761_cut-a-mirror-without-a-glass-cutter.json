If you don't have a steel file, you can purchase one at a hardware store for under $10 USD. The file doesn't need to be large, but should have relatively sharp, angled edges to cut the glass. To cut glass with steel, you'll position the sharp edge (or pointed tip) of the file against the mirror, then scrape it back and forth until you've lightly scored the glass. Be aware that using a rough steel edge (like a file) to cut glass may result in an imprecise cut and a sloppy break. A carbide scribe will produce a sharper, more clean and accurate cut."
