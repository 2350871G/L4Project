If you have a vegetable brush, use it to gently scrub-down the whole artichoke to remove the filmy natural coating it produces while growing. Use a stainless steel knife to cut off the top one-third of the artichoke. Using a serrated knife will make cutting through the leaves quite a bit easier. Lay the artichoke on its side, and carefully saw back and forth until you cut all the way through to the other end. It is very important that you use a stainless steel knife to cut the artichoke.

Squeeze the juice from 1 lemon into a large bowl of cold water. Select a bowl that is large enough to hold all of your artichokes and fill it with cold water. Cut a fresh lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the water. Put the lemon halves in the bowl of water as well. Rub lemon over the artichoke before placing it in the lemon water. Rubbing extra lemon on the artichokes will further prevent browning. After you have all of the cut surfaces covered in lemon, place the artichoke in the bowl of lemon water while you finishing preparing the others. Boiling Artichoke Hearts Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium heat. Use a stainless steel or enamel pot to avoid discoloring the artichokes. After you have placed the pot on the stove, add a big squeeze of lemon juice for flavoring and to help prevent browning. Simmer the prepared artichoke hearts for about 15 minutes.

The water will stop boiling once the vegetables are added. Allow the water temperature to come up again and return to a hard boil before you begin timing.
