        "Repeat this for each of your nails.",
        "Continue applying acetone-soaked cotton balls or gauze and wrapping your fingertips in foil until you have wrapped all of your nails.",
        "The last few wraps might be hard to apply since you will have tin foil on your other fingertips.",
        "If possible, ask a friend or family member to help you with the last few wraps.",
        "Another option is to only process 1 hand or a few nails at a time.",
        "Wait 20 minutes to remove the wraps.",
        "You will not be able to do much while the wraps are in place, so plan to chill out for about 20 minutes.",
        "Watch a show, listen to some music, or just sit back and relax.",
        "Because of the foil, you will probably not be able to interact with the touch screen on your phone for the next 20 minutes, so now\u2019s a good time to charge your phone!",
        "Use a cuticle pusher to scrape off the remaining adhesive or polish.",
        "After the time is up, remove 1 of the wraps.",
        "Try to pull off an acrylic by gently inserting the tip of a cuticle pusher between the acrylic and your natural nail.",
        "For gel nails, try to scrape off some of the polish using a cuticle pusher.",
        "If the acrylic or gel nail polish comes off easily, then remove the wraps 1 at a time and use the cuticle pusher to remove the adhesive or polish from each nail.",
        "If the acrylic or gel polish will not come off easily, redo the wrap you just took off.",
        "Leave the rest of the wraps in place for another 5 minutes, and then check again.",
        "Remember, only remove 1 wrap at a time and scrape away the adhesive or gel polish immediately.",
        "Buff off any stuck on bits of adhesive with a small foam buffer.",
        "After you have taken off all of the acrylics or gel nail polish, use a foam buffer to remove any remaining bits of adhesive or polish.",
        "Rub the buffer over each of your nails using gentle pressure and a back and forth motion.",
        "You may need to buff a little harder in some spots to remove the adhesive or polish residue.Tip: The acetone will have a drying effect on the skin around your nails.",
        "Apply a thick hand lotion to your hands and nails after you finish removing your fake nails.",
        "Soaking Your Nails in Acetone Cut down acrylic nails so that they are as short as possible.",
        "If you have acrylic nails, this will reduce the amount of surface area and make it easier for the acetone to loosen your nails.",
        "Trim your acrylic nails down to the level of your natural nails.",
        "Do not trim your natural nails yet!",
        "Wait until after you remove the fake nails to trim them.",

        "Take a coarse grit emery board or nail file and rub it back and forth over the top of each of your nails.",
        "For acrylics, file the area where the acrylic meets your natural nail (near the cuticle bed) until the adhesive is exposed.",
        "For gel nails, file the entire surface of the nail until they are no longer shiny.",
        "Acrylic nails sit on top of your natural nail, so it will be difficult for the acetone to penetrate the nail unless you file them down first.",
        "Likewise, gel nails have a clear topcoat that protects the polish.",
        "Filing down the acrylic or gel topcoat before soaking the nail will help to make this process quicker and easier.",
        "Fill a small dish with pure acetone.",
        "Use a shallow glass dish that is big enough to fit all of your fingertips into at 1 time.",
        "This size dish will likely have a 2 cup (480 mL) capacity.",
        "Fill the dish about halfway with pure acetone.",
        "You can buy pure acetone in the nail supplies section of a drug or grocery store.",
        "You may also use a non-acetone nail polish remover if you prefer.",
        "It will just take longer than an acetone nail polish remover.",
        "Place the dish into a larger bowl of hot water.",
        "Warming the acetone will help to make it work faster and remove the nails more effectively.",
        "Get a dish that is about 2 times the size of your acetone dish and fill it about \u00bc of the way full with very hot water from the tap.",
        "Then, place the acetone dish into the water-filled bowl.",
        "Make sure that the water does not overflow into the acetone dish!",
        "Set the acetone dish into the water dish slowly.",
        "If it looks like the water will overflow, then pour some out and try again.Tip: Acetone is harsh and it will dry out your skin.",
        "If desired, add a few drops of baby oil to the dish of acetone to help counteract the drying effects.",
        "Soak your nails in the acetone for 10 minutes.",
        "Dip your nails into the acetone up to the level of your cuticles and hold them there for 10 minutes.",
        "The acetone will loosen the adhesive holding on acrylic nails or it will dissolve the gel polish if you have gel nails.",
        "To reduce the amount of acetone that contacts your skin, angle your fingers so that just the nails are immersed in the acetone.",
        "Remove your nails from the acetone and check to see if they are loose.",
        "Once the time is up, take your fingertips out of the acetone and check your nails.",
        "Insert the end of a wooden cuticle pusher into the area between your natural nail and acrylic and see if it comes off easily.",
        "Use the end of the cuticle pusher to gently scrape off any remaining gel polish.",
        "Do this for all of your nails.",
        "If the acrylics are still hard to budge or if your gel nails are hard to scrape off, put your nails back into the acetone for a few more minutes.",
        "Scrape away the remaining adhesive or gel polish with a cuticle pusher.",
        "After you have finished soaking your nails and you can remove the acrylics or excess polish easily with a cuticle pusher, continue removing them.",
        "Remove all of the acrylics or scrape off all of the gel polish.",
        "If you have acrylics, then you will also need to scrape off the remaining adhesive with a cuticle pusher.",
        "Removing Acrylics with Dental Floss Be aware that this technique may damage your natural nails.",
        "This method of removing acrylic nails is not recommended by nail professionals.",
        "Using floss to remove your fake nails can result in pulling off part of your natural nail, which can be painful and possibly lead to an infection.",
        "Purchase dental flossers that are on a stick.",
        "These are widely available and they are perfect for removing fake nails.",
        "To make the process even easier, you may want to choose a brand that is meant for flossing between tightly-spaced teeth, such as Glide.",
        "If you don\u2019t have or don\u2019t want to buy flosser sticks, then you may also use regular floss.",
        "However, you might need a friend to help you since you won\u2019t be able to keep the floss taut with only 1 hand.",
        "Use the toothpick part of the flosser to loosen the fake nail.",
        "The end of the flosser should be pointed.",
        "Stick this end under part of your acrylic to create a gap.",
        "Be careful not to pry up too much of the nail as you do this.",
        "Only lift the end of the acrylic slightly where it meets your natural nail.Tip: A cuticle stick will also work to pry up the acrylic.",
        "Press the floss against your natural nail and move it under the acrylic nail.",
        "Position the floss against your natural nail where the acrylic nail begins.",
        "Then, press down and move the floss under the acrylic.",
        "If you have someone helping you using regular floss, then have them hold the floss taut and press it against your natural nail.",
        "Use a back and forth motion to work the floss under the acrylic.",
        "Move the flosser back and forth like you would to floss your teeth.",
        "Hold the acrylic nail down with 1 finger to keep it still as you do this.",
        "Continue working the floss forward until you reach the end of your natural nail and the acrylic nail comes off.",
        "Make sure that you go slow!",
        "If you go too quickly, then you may pull off part of your natural nail.",
        "Repeat the process to remove all of your acrylic nails.",
        "Continue to take 1 nail off at a time until you have removed all of them.",
        "After you are finished, trim, file, and buff your nails to clean them up.",
        "Then, do your nails as desired!"
