Block the wheels on the end of the car not being worked on.  Set the parking brake.  Loosen the lug nuts on both wheels.  Jack the car up. Place a jack stand under the axle. Jack the car back down until it rests firmly on the jack stand. Repeat the process on the other side of the car. Remove the lug nuts from each wheel and remove the wheels from the hubs. Place the wheels under the car between the jack stands as a backup in the event a jack stand fails. Remove the 2 12 mm bolts on the inside of the wheel that secure the caliper.  Grasp the caliper with both hands and pull it off the disc. If the caliper is hard to pull off, use a screwdriver to pry it loose. Remove the brake shoes from the caliper. Secure the caliper by feeding twine through one of the bolt holes in the caliper and tying the twine to the coil spring. Inspect the brake shoes. The groove through the center of the brake pad is a wear indicator. If the pad is worn to the base of the groove, or if the thickness of the pad is less than 3/16-inch (5 mm), it needs to be replaced. Use a micrometer to measure the thickness of the rotor. Compare the rotor thickness with the minimum rotor thickness (expressed in millimeters) that is engraved on the edge of the rotor. The rotor must be replaced before it reaches the specified minimum thickness. Inspect the rotor for scoring, warping or other damage.  Remove the rotor if it is damaged or if it is close to its minimum thickness. Remove the caliper bracket using a 15 mm socket wrench to remove the 2 bolts that secure the bracket in place. Pull the rotor off the wheel hub. Clean the wheel hub with emery cloth. Take your rotor to a machine shop or auto repair shop to have it machined or turned. Damaged rotors that still have sufficient thickness may be machined, or turned, to return the disc face to a smooth, flat surface. Place the new, or machined, rotor on the wheel hub. If you're installing a new rotor, spray it with brake cleaner to remove any rust prevention coating. Replace the caliper bracket, install the bracket mounting bolts and tighten them to 80 foot (24.4 m)-pounds with the torque wrench.  Use a 6-inch C-clamp to push the piston back into the caliper.  Install the new outer brake pad into the caliper bracket and the inner pad into caliper piston.  Cut and remove the twine used to temporarily secure the caliper and insert the caliper back into the caliper bracket and over the rotor.  Replace the caliper mounting bolts and tighten to 20 foot (6.1 m)-pounds with the torque wrench.  Repeat the procedure on the wheel on the other side of the car.  Replace the wheels and lightly tighten the lug nuts.  Jack the car up to remove the jack stands, then lower the car to the ground.  Tighten the lug nuts to 95 foot (29.0 m)-pounds.  Add brake fluid to the master cylinder to refill it.  Pump the brake pedal until it feels firm. ",
