Pull through this loop to secure the ring. Do not pull on the tail that is extending from the ring! This will close the ring. Keep the ring open until you have finished working stitches into the center. How to Choose Yarn for Crocheting Hexagons\nUse cotton yarn if you want the item to absorb moisture, such as coasters, placemats, or table runners. Opt for a wool or wool-acrylic blend yarn to make something warm, such as an afghan or scarf. Choose an acrylic or acrylic-blend yarn to make something durable and machine washable, such as a sweater, scarf, or hat."

Wrap the yarn over the hook and pull it through the loop to create a new chain stitch. Then, yarn over again and pull this loop through the loop on the hook to make the second chain. This chain of 2 provides slack for the round and will be necessary for finishing the round. Double crochet 2 times into the center of the ring. Yarn over the hook and then insert it into the center of the magic ring. Loop the yarn over the hook again, and then pull this loop back out of the ring to anchor the stitch on the edge of the ring. Yarn over again and pull through 2, and repeat. Do 1 more double crochet stitch into the center of the ring. Repeat the sequence for a total of 12 double crochet stitches. After the second double crochet stitch, make another chain of 2. Then, follow this with 2 more double crochet stitches. Continue this sequence all the way around the ring until you have a total of 12 double crochet stitches. Each of the chain 2 spaces will form a corner of the hexagon and each of the 2 double crochet stitches will form a flat part of the hexagon. Slipstitch into the top of the first stitch in the round. Tug the tail of the magic ring to bring the stitches closer together. When you get to the end of the round, insert the crochet hook into the top of the first chain of 2 you made. Then, yarn over and pull through the 2 loops on your crochet hook to secure the ends of the round together. This completes the first round. Expanding the Hexagon Chain 2 extending from the slipstitch. Start a new round by chaining 2. This will allow you to expand the original hexagon. Wrap the yarn around your hook, and pull through the other loop on the hook. Repeat this 1 more time for a total of 2 chains. This chain does not count as a chain 2 space, but it provides slack for the next stitch. Double crochet into the next chain 2 space. Yarn over your hook, insert it into the chain 2 space next to it, yarn over again and pull through 1. Yarn over and pull through 2. Then, yarn over and pull through 2 again. Chain 2 and double crochet into the chain 2 space again. Follow up the first double crochet stitch in the chain 2 space with a chain of 2. Then, double crochet into the same chain 2 space again. The new chain creates a chain 2 space for your next round. Double crochet 1 time into each of the next 2 stitches. Yarn over and insert your hook into the next double crochet stitch in the round. Then, yarn over again and pull through 1. Yarn over, and pull through 2. Then, yarn over and pull through 2 again to complete the first double crochet stitch. Repeat this for the next stitch as well.

Continue to work a double crochet, chain of 2, and double crochet stitch into each of the chain 2 spaces in the round. Then, work 1 double crochet stitch into each of the double crochet stitches between chain 2 spaces. The hexagon will maintain its shape if you continue to follow this sequence. Slipstitch to connect the first and last stitches. Insert the hook into the top of the first chain of 2 in the round, and then yarn over. Pull this loop through the other loop on the hook to secure the ends of the round together. This completes your second round! Keep working rounds until you are happy with the hexagon\u2019s size. You can continue to expand the original hexagon by working additional rounds. Stop when the hexagon is the desired size for your project. How to Choose a Size for Your Hexagons\nTo make coasters, opt for 4 in (10 cm) wide hexagons. For an afghan, table runner, or scarf, make 6 in (15 cm) wide hexagons and sew them together. Create placemats using 12 in (30 cm) wide hexagons. Using Crocheted Hexagons Use individual hexagons as coasters, placemats, or ornaments. Make a hexagon to the desired dimensions and use it however you like! Try making tiny hexagons to use as Christmas ornaments. Crochet 1 or 2 rounds and then loop a piece of ribbon through 1 of the chain 2 spaces. Tie the ribbon in a bow, and hang the ornament on a Christmas tree or on a hook on the wall.

Keep inserting the needle in through 1 side to create a mattress stitch. Sew another hexagon onto the opposite edge of the next hexagon, and repeat to expand the row. Sew together twelve 4 by 4 in (10 by 10 cm) hexagons in a row for a long, skinny hexagon scarf. Connect many hexagons for a geometric afghan. Thread a yarn needle with a matching or contrasting color yarn. Then, insert the yarn needle into the first 2 stitches on 1 flat edge of each of the hexagons. Continue to sew through the stitches along the edges of these 2 hexagons until you get to the end. Only insert the needle in through 1 side to create a mattress stitch.
