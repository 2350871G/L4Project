The best way to do this is to stun the bird with electricity, however, this is impractical for home processing. Hang the bird by its feet and, with a sharp knife, grip the head holding the beak shut with one hand while you cut through the side of the throat to the other side and pull the knife forward and out. This severs the carotid arteries and the jugular veins, as well as the trachea. Get back. The bird will flap and get blood everywhere, and you can lose an eye to a well placed flap of the wings (thus the goggles). It is a good idea to use this method to kill rather than simply breaking its neck because the heart continues to beat and helps empty the body of unneeded blood. If you believe this method causes too much pain and suffering for the bird, simply remove the entire head. The bird will be dead within seconds, however it will not bleed as well."
