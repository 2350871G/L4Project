That\u2019s because dark colors make objects recede, while light shades bring them forward. With a light shade on your lid, your eyes will appear larger and more prominent. If you have fair or light skin, ivory and cream shades are ideal lid colors. If you have medium or darker skin, opt for beige and tan shadows. Light pink or purple shades can compliment a wide variety of skin tones. To keep balance with the rest of your makeup, it's best to choose a neutral lip color when you want your eyes to look wider and more awake. By going with a soft lip color, it'll keep the focus on your eyes. The best bet is a shade that's similar to your natural lip color."

That helps lift the eye so it appears more open. You don't have to go for a dramatic wing if you want a softer look. A small flick at the end of your liner can still help open up your eye. Cat eye liner is traditionally done with a liquid eyeliner, but you can use a pencil or cream if you prefer. For a soft, natural look, use a powdered eye shadow and a small angled brush to create your cat eye liner. You can also skip eyeliner completely when you want a wide-eyed look. By not using liner on your upper lash line, it makes your eye lid space appear larger so your eyes look wider overall."

However, white liner can look very stark, especially if you have medium or darker skin, so it isn\u2019t the most natural option. In addition to nude and white shades, a champagne colored liner can help widen your eyes. The slight sheen that the metallic shade has provides a strong brightening effect too."
