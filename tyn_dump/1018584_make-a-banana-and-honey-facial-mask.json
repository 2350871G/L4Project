However, don\u2019t worry the baking soda doesn\u2019t warrant a serious concern. If you are uncertain how your skin will react to the baking soda, test a small, inconspicuous area of your face first before applying it all over. Try to spread out the use of this mask. Applying this mask 2-3 a week is sufficient. However, try not to go over 3 times a week since this mask is an exfoliating mask and you don\u2019t want to exfoliate your skin too frequently."
