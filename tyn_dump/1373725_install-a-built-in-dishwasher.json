        "If there was a prior dishwasher hookup, there\u2019s probably a dual outlet valve connected to the hot water line under the sink.",
        "One outlet connects to the faucet, while the other is for the dishwasher supply line.",
        "Run thread seal tape (often called Teflon tape) clockwise over the threads of the open outlet, hand-tighten the supply line on the outlet, then use a wrench to tighten the supply line another quarter-to-half turn.",
        "If there isn\u2019t already a dual outlet valve in place, you\u2019ll have to install one.",
        "Disconnect the supply line to the faucet, then attach the dual outlet valve to both the hot water line and the faucet supply line.",
        "Use thread seal tape, hand-tighten each connection, and give a quarter-to-half turn with your wrench.",
        "Don\u2019t connect the other end of the water supply line to the dishwasher yet.",
        "Install a dishwasher tailpiece to the sink\u2019s drainpipe if there isn\u2019t already one.",
        "If there was previously a dishwasher hooked up, or if your sink was plumbed with the intention of hooking up a dishwasher, there will already be a dishwasher tailpiece in place.",
        "It\u2019s a short stub of pipe that\u2019s smaller in diameter than the main drain pipe that it protrudes from.",
        "Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to add one.",
        "To install a dishwasher tailpiece, first loosen and disconnect the P-trap section of the drain pipe\u2014you\u2019ll be able to do this with just your hands if the pipe is made of PVC.",
        "Buy a replacement P-trap section that includes a dishwasher tailpiece, and connect it in place\u2014once again, hand-tightening is sufficient for PVC.",
        "Secure the dishwasher\u2019s drain line to the tailpiece under the sink.",
        "Slide one end of the flexible drain line firmly over the stubby dishwasher tailpiece.",
        "Use a screwdriver to tighten the hose clamp that\u2019s fitted on the end of the drain line\u2014this will ensure the drain line doesn\u2019t slide off of the tailpiece.",
        "Don\u2019t connect the other end of the drain line to the dishwasher yet.",
        "Strap the drain pipe under the sink so it\u2019s elevated above the tailpiece.",
        "Wrap a piece of plumber\u2019s strapping around the drain pipe and secure the strapping near the top of the under-sink cabinet with a screw or nail.",
        "This will create an upward arch in the drain pipe that rises above the tailpiece connection.",
        "This arch prevents drain water from backing up into the dishwasher.",
        "Alternatively, your local building code may require the use of an air gap to prevent backups.",
        "This is a more complicated procedure that may be best left to a professional plumber.",
        "Moving the Dishwasher into Place Secure the utility lines so they run under the center of the appliance.",
        "For a dishwasher with front hookups, run the water, drain, and electrical lines along the floor from the back of the dishwasher cabinet bay to the front, centered under the appliance.",
        "Make sure each line extends roughly 6 in (15 cm) beyond where the front of the dishwasher will end up, and use tape to secure the lines to the floor underneath where the appliance will be.",
        "For a dishwasher with rear hookups, don\u2019t secure the utility lines to the floor.",
        "Instead, make sure each is long enough that you can tie them into the back of the dishwasher before you push it into its final position in the cabinet bay.",
        "Adjust the feet of the dishwasher to set it at the proper height for your countertop.",
        "Built-in dishwashers are designed to fit nicely underneath the kitchen countertop, the bottom of which is typically 34.5 in (88 cm) off the floor in the U.S. Use the adjustable feet on the dishwasher to fine-tune the height of the unit, but leave a small gap\u2014as recommended by the manufacturer\u2014so you can secure the dishwasher to the underside of the countertop.",
        "Turn the feet counterclockwise to increase the height and clockwise to reduce it.",
        "In the U.S., bottom kitchen cabinets are generally standardized at 34.5 in (88 cm) high so that the work surface of the countertop will be roughly 36 in (91 cm) off the floor.",
        "Slide the dishwasher into place and fine-tune its height and positioning.",
        "Push, wiggle, and maneuver the bulky appliance into the cabinet bay until the front of the dishwasher is flush with the front of the surrounding cabinets.",
        "When it\u2019s in place, check that the unit is level with the underside of the countertop and at the proper height.",
        "Use the front feet to make slight adjustments as needed.",
        "Make sure to slide the dishwasher over the utility lines that are taped to the floor.",
        "If you\u2019ve centered them from back to front in the cabinet bay, they shouldn\u2019t be in the way of the feet of the appliance.",
        "Remember that you need to finish the utility hookups before installing the dishwasher if you have a rear hookup model.",
        "Finishing the Hookups and Installation Connect the water supply line to the dishwasher.",
        "Use the product guide to locate the water supply hookup at the bottom front of the appliance.",
        "Wrap thread seal (Teflon) tape around the water inlet connection, then tighten a right angle elbow to the inlet by hand and with a quarter-turn of a wrench.",
        "Wrap tape and tighten the connection between the right angle elbow and the water supply line in the same fashion.",
        "The right angle elbow prevents the water supply line from protruding outward from the front of the dishwasher.",
        "You might get one with your dishwasher, or need to buy one from a home supply store\u2014check where other dishwasher plumbing supplies are sold.",
        "The installation is the same with a rear hookup dishwasher, other than the location.",
        "Secure the drain line to the appliance with a hose clamp.",
        "Locate the appropriate hookup stub for the drain line, then press the flexible tube over the stub.",
        "Use a screwdriver to turn the screw and tighten the hose clamp that\u2019s on the end of the drain tube.",
        "Once again, this process (other than the location) is the same with a front hookup and rear hookup dishwasher.",
        "Connect the electrical wires to the dishwashing unit.",
        "Confirm one more time that the power is off to the electrical line, then feed the line into the dishwasher\u2019s labeled electrical box.",
        "Here again, the process (but not location) is the same for front- and rear-hookup units, so check the user\u2019s manual if you need help locating the box.",
        "Some dishwashers may be set up so that you can simply clip the wires inside the line in place.",
        "If not, do the following:\nAttach the black (hot) wire to the black wire in the box by twisting them together with an electrical wire nut.",
        "Secure the white (neutral) wire to the white wire in the box with another wire nut.",
        "Wrap the ground wire (usually green) securely around the ground screw in the electrical box, then tighten the screw over the wrapped wire.",
        "Tuck the secure connections into the dishwasher electric box and close it.",
        "It may have screws to keep it securely closed.",
        "Secure the dishwasher to the cabinet with the provided clips.",
        "Check one last time that the appliance is level, even, and in its proper spot, then attach the mounting brackets at the top of the dishwasher to the underside of the countertop.",
        "Mark the spots for the screws, pre-drill pilot holes into the underside of the countertop, and use a screwdriver to twist the screws into place.",
        "If you have stone or solid surface countertops, check the dishwasher manufacturer\u2019s instructions for the proper way to secure the unit in place.",
        "Now you\u2019re ready to turn the water and power on, check for leaks, and\u2014if you\u2019re leak free\u2014run your built-in dishwasher!"
