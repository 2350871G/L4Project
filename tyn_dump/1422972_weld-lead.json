Put on long-sleeved clothing and pants along with heat-resistant welding gloves and boots. You also need a respirator mask to protect yourself from the fumes released by the melting metal. Finish up by putting on a full face shield to cover your head. You can find welding equipment online or at some hardware stores. Also, look for industrial supply stores in your area. Since lead is so toxic, always wear gloves and a respirator when handling it. Wash your hands when you finish welding to avoid skin contamination. Keep your safety gear on the entire time you weld. You need the face mask, for example, to protect your eyes from the damaging light produced by welding torches."

If you need to, use a lead knife to cut through the spots you need to remove. Rock the knife back and forth while pushing it down with a steady amount of pressure to cut into the lead. Remove as much debris as you can, exposing the shiny surface underneath it. You could also try soaking the lead in a weak acid like vinegar for extra cleaning power. Submerge it for up to 5 minutes. Scrub the lead afterward to remove the oxidation. Remember to wear gloves and a respirator mask! Even though you aren\u2019t welding yet, the lead is still dangerous to handle."

Getting the pacing correct is a little tricky and requires practice. Move a consistent pace, spending about 1 second or less on any specific spot on the metal. This leads to a strong, consistent weld. Another option is to hold the welder so the flame is vertical over the lead, which works well for joints that are tough to reach. Melt a drop off the filler rod, then pull the welder back to let it settle. Continue doing this for 3 to 5 seconds to create a raindrop-shaped weld."
