Measuring the Weight of Peanut Butter Purchase a flat kitchen or digital scale. You can buy a digital scale online or at some department stores.

Peanut butter is hard to measure in a traditional liquid measuring cup because it's sticky and tends to ball up. If you fill up a container with water first, you can measure the amount of peanut butter without having to level it out. Fill up a measuring cup made for liquids with 2-cups (473.1 ml) of water.

If you don\u2019t want the peanut butter to stick to the spoon or spatula that you\u2019re using, spray it down with non-stick cooking spray, butter, or oil beforehand. Otherwise, just add peanut butter to the water in the measuring cup. Subtract 2 cups (473.176 ml) from the water measurement. The peanut butter will cause the water to rise in your measuring cup.
