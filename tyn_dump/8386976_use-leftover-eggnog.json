When the bottom of the bread is golden brown, use a spatula to flip it over. Let the other side of the bread cook for approximately 2 to 3 more minutes or until it is golden brown too. Serve the French toast with maple syrup. Lift the cooked toast off of the griddle, and transfer to a plate. Top it with warm maple syrup and serve immediately.
