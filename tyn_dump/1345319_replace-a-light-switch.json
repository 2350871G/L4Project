Tell the store employee what kind of switch you want and how many you\u2019ll need, and they can help you determine the best purchase. Single-pole switches are the simplest and most common. A single-pole switch has just two positions\u2014\u201con\u201d and \u201coff.\u201d Disconnect the power to the light switch at your home\u2019s electrical service panel (also known as the breaker box or load center). It\u2019s a steel box that may be located inside the house, in the basement, in the garage, or along one of the outside walls. You can either turn off the breaker that controls the lights in the specific room you are working on or turn off all the power to the house by switching off the main breaker. Test the switch. Flip the light switch on and off several times to be sure the power is off. Remove the switch plate cover. Using a flat-head screwdriver, turn the screws holding the plate in place counter-clockwise to loosen them. Unscrew the switch's mounting screws. Once the switch plate cover has been removed, use a flat-head screwdriver to remove the screws mounting the switch to the wall. Turn the screws counter-clockwise until they are freed from the wall.

You\u2019ll see a total of six wires: two black (hot) wires, two green or bare copper (grounding) wires, and two (neutral) wires, which may be black, white, red, or any other color than green.Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the \u201chot\u201d wire. Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the \u201cneutral\u201d wire. Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the \u201cgrounding\u201d wire. If the box contains only a single cable (or single set of three wires), it means the switch is at the end of the circuit. You will see a black (hot) wire, a green or bare copper (grounding) wire, and a third (neutral) wire, which may be black, white, red, or any color other than green.Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the \u201chot\u201d wire.

Changing a Three-Way Switch Make a written note or take a picture of how each wire is connected to the switch. A three-way switch allows you to control one appliance from two or more locations. The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch. Identify and mark each wire. A three-way switch requires three wires: a hot wire, a neutral wire, and a traveler wire. The switch will also have a green or bare copper grounding wire. The box may contain one or two cables, or sets of wires. Mark the wire connected to the colored screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the colored screw terminal (it will typically be a dark color and will not be green) as the \u201ccommon\u201d wire. Mark the two wires connected to the other two screw terminals as the \u201ctraveler\u201d wires. Mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch) as the \u201cgrounding\u201d wire. Disconnect the wires from the old switch. If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers.

Carefully push the wires back into the box and then push the switch up against the edge of the box and tighten the mounting screws into place.  Replace the switch plate and tighten the screws into place. Do not over tighten the switch plate, since it may crack under too much pressure. Return to the breaker box and turn the power to the light switch back on. Go back to the new switch and flip it on and off several times to ensure it\u2019s in working order. Changing a Dimmer Switch Mark each wire in the switch box. A dimmer switch allows you to control the brightness of a light fixture. Use a marker or colored tape to uniquely label each wire so you can tell them apart. Mark the wire connected to the brass screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the brass terminal as the \u201chot\u201d wire. Mark the wire connected to the silver screw terminal or to the hole on the same side as the silver terminal as the \u201cneutral\u201d wire. Finally, mark the green or copper wire connected to the green screw terminal (on the other side of the switch from the brass and silver terminals) as the \u201cgrounding\u201d wire. Disconnect the wires from the old switch. The switch may have either screw terminal connectors, which will be located along the side of the switch, or push-in connector holes, which will be located at the back of the switch. If the wires are connected to screw terminals, turn each screw counter-clockwise with a screwdriver to loosen and slide the wire out with a pair of needle-nose pliers. If the wires are connected to push-in connectors, the holes that the wires are pushed into will typically have a small slot beneath the hole. Insert a small screwdriver into the slot and push forward to release the wire. Connect the wires to the new switch. Most dimmer switches come with wires already attached. You will see two black lead wires and one green grounding wire. Strip 1/2 inch of insulation from each to expose the wire. Pair one of the black lead wires to the black hot wire in the switch box. Pair the other black lead wire to the white neutral wire in the switch box. Pair the green grounding wire with the bare or green grounding wire in the switch box. Wrap the ends of the paired wires together and secure with a wire nut. Double-check that the switch is properly oriented. You should see the word \u201ctop\u201d written on the switch indicating the side of the switch that should be vertically oriented toward the top. Carefully push the wires back into the box and then push the switch up against the edge of the box and tighten the mounting screws into place.  Replace the switch plate and tighten the screws into place. Do not over tighten the switch plate, since it may crack under too much pressure. Return to the breaker box and turn the power to the light switch back on. Go back to the new switch and flip it on and off several times to ensure it\u2019s in working order.",
