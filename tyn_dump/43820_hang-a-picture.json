    "text": " Placing your Picture Hold the picture you have selected against the wall. It is worth spending some time considering placement, taking into account furnishings in the room, and the general environment and lighting. A good height for hanging pictures is often when your eye level is about a quarter of the way down the image, although this is a matter of taste. If you have a friend or family member around, ask them to hold the painting against the wall for you so that you can see it from further away. If you don't have anyone around to hold the painting for you, hold the painting against the all and mark where the corners of the painting are with pencil. You can then put the painting down and step back to look at the markings. Make any adjustments you see fit and repeat until you find where you would like the painting to be. Erase the pencil markings when you are done hanging your picture. Mark the wall along the top center of the picture with a pencil. If you have trouble detecting where the center is by just looking at it, use a tape measure and make sure you make your mark halfway across the top of the picture. You do not need to draw a line along the entire top of the picture; simply mark along the very center of the picture. Put the picture face down on a flat surface. Hook a tape measure on the hanging wire attached to the back of the picture. Pull the wire up towards the top of the picture so that it is taut. Measure the distance from the top of the picture to the hanging wire. If your picture has a crossbar instead of a hanging wire, measure the distance from the crossbar to the top of the picture. Use this measurement (the distance from the hanging device to the top of the picture) to determine where you should place your nail or screw. Measure the same distance down from the pencil mark you have made on the wall and mark this point with another pencil mark. This will be where you place your nail. When you make this measurement, try to keep the line as vertical as possible. Choosing your Hanging Implement Decide whether you are going to use a simple nail or screw, or a traditional picture hook. These options are good for hanging pictures that are 20 pounds or less. If you are using a nail and hammer: Select a 1 \u00bd-inch (4d) or 2-inch (6d) nail. Place the nail in the center of the pencil marking that you made in the previous step. Drive the nail into the wall at a steep 45-degree angle. The 45-degree angle gives the nail much greater strength than simply driving it straight into the wall. If you are using a drill and screw:  Drill a hole in the center of the pencil mark you made. Screw the screw into the hole. If you are using a traditional picture hook: Insert the nail through the sleeve on the hook. Hold the hook against the wall at the desired height (where you made the pencil mark) and tap the nail into the wall (the hook will hold the nail at a 45-degree angle automatically). Be carefully to only tap the nail and not the hook, as the hook could cut your wall. Decide what hanging implement you are going to use for pictures that are heavier than 20 pounds. Heavier pictures call for more durable hanging devices. Choose between a spiral anchor or a toggle bolt. If using a spiral anchor: This method is the easiest way to hang heavy pictures. Drive the spiral anchor into the wall with a screwdriver. Drive a screw into the anchor with a screwdriver. Some spiral anchors come with special picture hanging hooks. If using a toggle bolt: Drill a \u00bd-inch hole into the wall. Align the metal channel along with the straps and slide the metal channel into the hole. Hold the ends of the straps with your thumb and forefinger. Pull them toward you until the channel rests flush against the backside of the wall. Slide the plastic cap along the straps until the cap is flush against the wall. Push the straps side to side and snap them off when they are level to the cap. Insert a bolt over the cap and insert the bolt. The package that the toggle bolt comes in will have specific instructions for your individual bolt. Hanging your Picture and Making it Level Carefully position the artwork on the hanging implement of your choice. Make sure that the picture is firmly secured to the hanging device before letting go. If the picture is not firmly secured, it could fall to the ground and the frame or glass could break. If you are using screws or nails, position the picture so that the screw/nail hooks on to the hanging device on the back of the picture. Use a level to determine whether or not your picture is hung straight. Place the level on top of the picture. If the bubble measure remains in the center of the level, then your picture is hung straight. If the bubble is off to one side, adjust the picture until the bubble is in the center of the level.",
