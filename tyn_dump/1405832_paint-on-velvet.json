Stretch the velvet over the bars so that it lays flat and there are no wrinkles. Use a staple gun to staple the fabric to the frame, alternating sides as you go; put one staple on one side, one staple on the other side, one staple on the top, and one staple on the bottom. Repeat until the entire piece of velvet is stapled to the frame. You may also want to put a barrier between the velvet and the frame bars. A piece of cardboard or an acid-free foam core board work well and will prevent a line from forming in the paint where the velvet contacts the frame. The barrier should be slightly smaller than the frame bars so that you can easily remove it when your painting is dry. Frame bars are available at most craft and supply shops."
