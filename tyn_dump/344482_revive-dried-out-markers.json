        "Once it's out, if there's a similar soft fabric end on the other side of the tip, try flipping the tip around and replacing it.",
        "The marker should be able to write immediately.",
        "As ink soaks through the previously dry end of the tip, you can remove the tip again and flip it back around if you wish.",
        "You may want to wear gloves and protect your work area with an old rag while attempting this method.",
        "Though unlikely, it's possible to spill ink out of the marker once you remove the tip, so having some protection against difficult-to-remove stains is a wise idea.",
        "As a last resort, try buying refill ink.",
        "While effective, the methods above will only work if ink remains inside the marker.",
        "For dry-erase markers that are completely dry \u2014 that is, both the tip and the inside of the marker are dried out \u2014 you may need to buy replacement ink.",
        "Refill dry-erase ink can usually be purchased from office supply stores or specialty online retailers.",
        "Usually, dry-erase is quite cheap \u2014sometimes as low for $1.00 for a small canister of ink.",
        "Reviving Permanent Markers Soak the dry marker tips in rubbing alcohol.",
        "For most permanent markers (like Sharpies, etc.)",
        "with dried out tips, you can get the marker writing again with a trick that's similar to the water-soaking method for water-based markers above.",
        "For this method, start by filling a small container with rubbing alcohol \u2014 for instance, you may want to use the cap of the bottle of rubbing alcohol.",
        "You don't need very much rubbing alcohol \u2014 just enough to submerge the tip of your marker (or markers).",
        "Filling an entire bowl with rubbing alcohol (as you'd do with water for water-based markers) may be wasteful.",
        "Let the markers dry with their caps on.",
        "After soaking your markers for a few minutes in rubbing alcohol, you should notice a small amount of ink swirling around in the liquid.",
        "Remove the markers from the alcohol and replace their caps.",
        "Place them tip-side up in a glass or mug and let them rest for about 24-48 hours.",
        "After this resting period, if ink remains in the markers, they should write well once again.",
        "Rubbing alcohol evaporates very quickly compared to water, so you won't want to let the markers rest with their caps off as you would after soaking water-based markers.",
        "If you do, they'll quickly dry out again.",
        "Consider using the leftover alcohol as ink.",
        "If the alcohol you soaked your marker tips in absorbed some of the ink from your permanent markers, you may want to try using it as a form of ink or dye in you own art projects.",
        "Alcohol-based inks are quite effective at dying materials like metal that other inks can be ineffective on.",
        "For instance, to make custom-colored staples, simply soak the staples in leftover alcohol that you used to moisten colored permanent markers' tips.",
        "Alternatively, inject alcohol or acetone into the marker.",
        "Like with water-based markers, you can sometimes get new life out of a dried-out permanent marker by injecting moisture directly into it.",
        "However, in this case, you won't want to use water, but instead your marker's ink solvent.",
        "Usually, this is isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) or acetone (the active ingredient in nail polish remover), so simply inject a milliliter or so of one of these chemicals into the body of the marker as you would with water above.",
        "Try checking your markers' packaging for a list of ingredients if you're not sure what sort of liquid solvent your ink uses."
