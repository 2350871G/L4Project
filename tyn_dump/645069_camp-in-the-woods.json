Hiking shoes, which look similar to regular tennis shoes, are great options for day trips. Choose a pair that feel snug but give your toes a little room to move around. Hiking shoes or boots are a must if you plan on walking around, especially if you\u2019re around rocks or slippery areas. They hold up better to the moisture and give more traction on difficult walking surfaces than regular shoes. Day hiking boots are a sturdier footwear option that\u2019s useful for short hikes and carrying light loads.

Dig a hole in the ground about the size of the fire you desire, then surround it with rocks. Stack smaller branches over bigger ones in the hole, then light the bigger branches to start your fire! To put out the fire, smother it with dirt or water. You can push the tinder around with a large stick to make sure it is out. You shouldn\u2019t feel any heat coming off the tinder when you move your hands towards it. A good campfire is useful for cold nights or cooking out in the open, but it isn\u2019t always necessary. If you have a portable stove in the middle of summer, you may wish to skip building a separate fire pit. Be cautious when starting fires.

Symptoms of dehydration include headaches, dry mouth, dizziness, and fatigue. If you are dehydrated, drink water as soon as possible and consider going to a doctor immediately. Boiling water does help, but it may not purify it enough to make it completely safe to drink. For the best results, bring a portable filter."

Keep all of your cooking supplies at the edge of your area, far from your tent. Lock food away in a bear-proof cooler to discourage theft. Avoid cooking fragrant foods like bacon or fish, if possible, since these are most likely to attract wild animals.

If you see them, do not approach them. Stay back and make loud noises, such as by talking, yelling, and banging items together, to scare the animal off. Bear attacks are relatively rare, but you should still know how to deal with them. If a bear growls or looks defensive, stand still. If it charges, lie down and play dead."

You may be able to risk leaving the jacket at home. Include a rain jacket to stay dry in bad weather. Look for jackets that are both waterproof and breathable. These jackets feel lighter and less oppressive than regular rain jackets. Water-resistant gear is available, but it is only meant to shield you from light rains over a short amount of time. Some items, including ponchos, are okay to use in a stationary camp. These options are cheaper but can easily break. Consider investing in waterproof clothing if you plan on being around water a lot, such as while on a boat. Wear a bandana, wide hat, or other sun protection. Take into account how long you will be exposed to the sun so you don\u2019t get any nasty burns. Cover your head with a bandana or wear a wide-brimmed hat to protect the top of your head. You will likely want sunglasses as well to shield your eyes. You definitely need these items while you are out in the daytime. They are important even when the skies are overcast. Select a pair of hiking boots that support your ankles. Hiking boots may not seem important for camping in the woods, but a good pair of shoes can protect you from ankle injuries. Hiking shoes, which look similar to regular tennis shoes, are great options for day trips. Choose a pair that feel snug but give your toes a little room to move around. Hiking shoes or boots are a must if you plan on walking around, especially if you\u2019re around rocks or slippery areas. They hold up better to the moisture and give more traction on difficult walking surfaces than regular shoes. Day hiking boots are a sturdier footwear option that\u2019s useful for short hikes and carrying light loads. Backpacking boots give you extra support when you are on long trips and carrying heavier loads. Packing Supplies Bring a portable stove to cook your food. You can purchase a portable burner to cook up food on the go. Some stoves run on propane, but others use wood or charcoal, so bring some fuel as well. Take matches as well in case you need them to activate the stove. You can also cook over a campfire. Try bringing along a cooking grate and lay it over your fire pit. Bring a pot, knife, and other utensils. If you pack lightly, you don\u2019t need to take a lot of these supplies. Most portable ovens are small, so you end up cooking everything in a single pot. You will need a sharp knife in order to cut food, open cans, and perform other handy tasks around camp. Bring a few forks and spoons to help you cook and eat. Plastic utensils and paper plates are acceptable if you\u2019re not isolated in the woods. For backpacking trips, these items are an issue since they aren\u2019t reusable and you may not find a place to throw them away. Choose prepared foods you can eat on the go. Peanut butter, granola bars, nuts, jerky, and dried fruits all require little to no preparation. When you don\u2019t have time to cook or are unable to because of a storm, you will have these snacks to tide you over. These foods don\u2019t take up much space and won\u2019t expire during your trip. If you have access to a vehicle, you can still bring a cooler with meat, beverages, and other goodies. Bring along canteens filled with water. Take reusable canteens that you can keep filled at all times. Plastic water bottles are fine, but keep in mind that they can be heavy and you may not be able to dispose of used bottles right away. If you\u2019re on the go, a gravity filter will allow you to purify water wherever you camp. If you\u2019re going to an established campground, find out where the water taps are so you can access them at all times. If you think you may not have access to clean water, bring water purification tablets so you can sterilize water from a natural source. Keep a first-aid kit ready in case of emergencies. Pack your first-aid kit with a list of emergency phone numbers and any medications you need. Bandages, a needle, scissors, and antiseptic wipes are a few useful supplies to include in the kit. You may wish to include duct tape, which can be used in a multitude of ways around camp. For instance, you can set a broken bone by making a splint out of clothing, branches, and duct tape. Also, consider bringing a satellite phone so you can always call for help during an emergency. Bring along some entertainment to keep you busy. Keeping yourself entertained is up to you, but a pack of cards can go a long way. Electronics usually aren\u2019t an option out in the woods, so use your time to relax. Read books, tell stories, or observe wildlife. Consider what your needs are. If you plan on walking a lot, you might not be able to bring along a lot of games or activities. If fishing is legal near your campground, you might bring along fishing supplies, for example. Use insect repellent and sunscreen to protect yourself. Bugs and bright sunlight are common in the woods, so don\u2019t let them ruin your trip. Make use of these products at least once a day to protect your skin. Increase their effectiveness by wearing covering clothing and taking shelter in your tent. Choose a broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Try to reapply the sunscreen at least every 2 hours, or more often if you\u2019re getting wet or sweaty. Spray an insect repellent containing DEET or picaridin on your clothing and exposed skin to protect you from mosquitoes, ticks, and other biting pests. Setting up and Maintaining Camp Choose a spot away from hills. When camping, the best spots are ones where you won\u2019t wake up in a puddle of rainwater. Look for flat pieces of ground that are above nearby slopes. If you camp near a slope, water may run down it and gather underneath your tent. If possible, look for marked spots or clearings where other people have camped before. While you can dig out the soil to guide water away from you, this is frowned upon in many camping areas. Avoid the trouble by choosing your spot carefully. Pitch your tent on level ground. Whether you camp in a tent or an RV, the ground needs to be as flat as possible. Most commercial sites are situated on ideal spots, but if you\u2019re out in the wilderness on your own, search around for a decent spot. Level ground feels more comfortable to lie on and you can rest easy knowing water won\u2019t rush towards your tent. Stake your tent carefully. Plant the stakes firmly in the ground and tether your tent to them with strong rope. Position a waterproof tarp underneath your tent. Your tent should rest completely on the tarp in order to seal out water. Fold the tarp so that it doesn\u2019t protrude out from under the tent. If it sticks out at all, water can get on top of it and leak into your tent. Another way to lay down a tarp is to put it inside the tent. Tuck the edges up over the tent\u2019s frame so water can\u2019t get on top of the tarp. Build a fire pit to start a fire. Clear the wood and other debris from an area about 10 ft (3.0 m) away from your tent. Dig a hole in the ground about the size of the fire you desire, then surround it with rocks. Stack smaller branches over bigger ones in the hole, then light the bigger branches to start your fire! To put out the fire, smother it with dirt or water. You can push the tinder around with a large stick to make sure it is out. You shouldn\u2019t feel any heat coming off the tinder when you move your hands towards it. A good campfire is useful for cold nights or cooking out in the open, but it isn\u2019t always necessary. If you have a portable stove in the middle of summer, you may wish to skip building a separate fire pit. Be cautious when starting fires. Always keep an eye on the fire and put it out before you return to your tent or leave the area. Drink plenty of water while you camp. Many woodland campgrounds have taps you can access to keep yourself hydrated. If a tap isn\u2019t available, pop open bottles of water or purify your own water by setting up a gravity filter. Dehydration is a risk, especially during hikes, so keep your canteens filled. Symptoms of dehydration include headaches, dry mouth, dizziness, and fatigue. If you are dehydrated, drink water as soon as possible and consider going to a doctor immediately. Boiling water does help, but it may not purify it enough to make it completely safe to drink. For the best results, bring a portable filter. Move food waste away from your campground. Hungry animals may show up when you least expect them. Always clean your campground after you eat, disposing of or storing your waste. Keep all of your cooking supplies at the edge of your area, far from your tent. Lock food away in a bear-proof cooler to discourage theft. Avoid cooking fragrant foods like bacon or fish, if possible, since these are most likely to attract wild animals. One way to protect your food is to suspend a bear-proof cooler from a dark rope tied to a tree branch. Animals may give up quickly if they can\u2019t reach the food. Scare away bears and other wild animals if they find your camp. Wild animals can be a problem in the woods, especially bears and wolves. Encountering these creatures may be a scary thought, but they are mostly harmless. If you see them, do not approach them. Stay back and make loud noises, such as by talking, yelling, and banging items together, to scare the animal off. Bear attacks are relatively rare, but you should still know how to deal with them. If a bear growls or looks defensive, stand still. If it charges, lie down and play dead. Clean up your camping area before you leave. Leave your campsite as you found it! Make sure your campfire is out first. Then, collect all of your gear and waste. Avoid leaving trash like food tins or plastic bottles lying around. Keep the land pristine so the next camper can enjoy it too. Sometimes you may have to bite the bullet and carry trash with you until you find a place to throw it away. Clear out your fire pit if you dug one and fill it with dirt again. Avoid burying trash in it.",

        "Britt Edelen\t\t\tOutdoor Educator\t\t\t\tBe thoughtful about what you pack.",
        "The two biggest mistakes that people make are either packing too much or not packing enough.",
        "You want to have plenty on hand just in case anything unexpected happens, so pack things like snacks, extra water, and a flashlight, even for short hikes.",
        "However, you probably don't need to take things like extra shoes and socks, because carrying all of that stuff can quickly get tiring.",
        "Selecting Clothing Bring at least 1 change of clothing.",

        "It also helps when you\u2019re sweating through warm weather.",

        "Arrange your outfits before you leave and make room for them in your pack.",

        "At a minimum, you need 2 outfits.",
        "Bring more if you would like, but make sure you can carry it.",
        "Wear clothing made from a quick-drying fabric.",
        "Nothing is worse than wearing a cotton T-shirt and denim jeans drenched in rain and sweat.",
        "The best fabrics for camping are synthetics, such as nylon and polyester, and some natural materials, such as fleece and merino wool.",
        "These fabrics all wick away water and dry more quickly than cotton clothing.",
