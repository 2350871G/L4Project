Attach the batting to the two pieces of fabric using sewing pins, or follow the instructions on the package to iron on the batting if you are using iron on batting.

You can wear quilting gloves to help you guide the quilt through the sewing machine, as it can be tricky to keep both pieces of fabric straight as you sew.
