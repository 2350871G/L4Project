                    "description": "Before doing any gymnastic maneuver, it's imperative that you properly stretch and train your body. Because of the nature of a chest roll, you'll want to pay special attention to your back, neck, and abdomen. Attempting a maneuver without proper stretching can cause serious injuries, including dislocations, muscle strains, and spinal injuries. Practice and perfect the form of a gymnastic move (in this case, the chest roll) before attempting to actually do it as a moving maneuver. Be sure that your back and neck are loose and well-stretched. Attempting a chest roll without stretching or working on your form could cause serious injuries, and will set your training back significantly."

It's a good idea to have a gymnastics mat on the floor, so make sure you're at an end of the mat and will have sufficient room to roll forward. Kneel with your feet out behind you. Don't sit back on your feet - make sure that you are kneeling with your body in an upright position. Extend your hands out at your sides with your palms open and facing forward."

To do this, you'll need to push your hips forward while arching your back. Keep your hands slightly forward and angled down, and make sure your palms remain open and forward. Your back should be arched back above or past your hips."

Roll onto your stomach first, then let your body continue forward until you're on your chest. Rest the side of your face on the mat in front of you. Once you've rolled onto your chest you'll maintain that position, which is known as a chest stand. Keep your back arched, even in the chest stand. You may poise your legs above your head, keeping your feet close together, or if you're more advanced you may push even further and let your feet touch the floor while in a chest stand. Do not attempt to touch your feet to the floor unless you've had sufficient training and supervision, ideally with a trained gymnast. Keep your palms flat on the floor (or mat) once you've rolled onto your chest. Your hands will help stabilize your body as you maintain the chest stand.

Once you're more advanced, though, you can enter a bridge (sometimes called a \"wheel\" in yoga) and push forward into a standing position. Put your feet flat on the ground, like you would during a fully-rolled chest stand. Push up with your hands, keeping your palms flat against the floor/matt. Rotate your wrists so that your fingers face ahead of you instead of behind you. Enter a \"bridge\" position, where your hands and feet are the only parts of your body touching the floor. Keep your back arched, but make sure your arms and legs are straight (but not locked) and close together. Push forward, continuing your momentum towards a full standing position. Remember that this takes a long time to perfect, and should not be rushed. Attempting to complete the roll into a bridge position without proper training could result in serious injury."

Without using your hands, raise your hips so that your head, shoulders, arms, and feet are the only parts touching the floor. Do pelvic thrusts - lie on your back with your legs in the air at a 90 degree angle.
