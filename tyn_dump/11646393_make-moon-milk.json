Continue warming the milk until it begins to simmer, or when small bubbles slowly begin breaking the surface of the milk.It's best to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan to avoid scorching the milk. However, since you're warming the milk at a low heat, you can use a lightweight saucepan if that's all you have on hand. You can also use an unsweetened milk substitute, such as coconut, soy, almond, or cashew milk, if you prefer."
