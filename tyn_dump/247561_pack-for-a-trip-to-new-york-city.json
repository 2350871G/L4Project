Temperatures stay hot, even through the nights when the heat can remain in the 90s (32 degrees C and above.) On top of that, NYC gets very humid. This means thick, sticky air. There are also the occasional thunderstorms that rage violently then subside."

For women: Wispy graphic tanks are a cute way to beat the heat while still looking fashionable. Crop top shirts with a high-waisted skirt or shorts are a pretty standard look around NYC in the summertime. For men: Cotton t-shirts and button-ups are good choices for a summer trip to NYC."

Cute shorts made from funky material, high-waisted skirts, baggy cotton gypsy pants--you can\u2019t really go wrong, so long as you\u2019re not wearing thick pants that will make you sweat bullets. For men: It is a common belief that men do not wear shorts in NYC unless they are playing a sport, heading out on a boat, or going to the beach. Other New Yorkers, however, contest this and say it's fine. It really depends on whether or not you care about what people think. Nice boating shorts in khaki or other Vineyard Vines-esque shorts are good. Otherwise, you can stick to breathable pants."

Comfortable does mean that you have to forsake style--you can always orthopedics to the inside of your cute boots, flats, etc. If you will die if you don\u2019t wear sandals, at least try to find some with a bit of arch support. Just keep in mind that the streets are pretty dirty--don\u2019t be surprised if you end up with some dirt lines by the end of the day. As stated above, if you plan on going out at night, bring some cute high heels. While they may be uncomfortable to walk in, they are required at some clubs. Bring your wallet. As with every city, NYC is expensive. Depending on what you are doing while you visit, your tab may be higher or lower than other visitors. You can get a slice of pizza for as little as $3 or you can drop $300 at one of New York City\u2019s many foodie\u2019s-heaven restaurants. Bring your camera. New York City has some of the most iconic scenes (like a picture in front of the Statue of Liberty for instance.) You will be kicking yourself if you forget to bring your camera with you. Rock some sunglasses. If it's sunny, there are bound to be New Yorkers walking around wearing sunglasses. Don\u2019t forget yours at home. Sunglasses also combat the brightness of sunlight reflecting off snow. Bring a big bag. Women in New York carry big, fashionable purses during the day. If you are concerned about getting pick-pocketed, buy a big purse with a zipper. Lots of guys also carry messenger bags. However, leave the backpacks at home unless you are a high school student. Pack an umbrella. This is particularly important for fall and spring months but it's a pretty handy thing to have all year round. Summer tends to bring in thunderstorms, and winter is known for sleet. However, if you forget your umbrella, you will have about 1,001 options to choose from at street vendors\u2019 stands. Buy a map of New York City. Even if you don\u2019t carry it around during the day for fear that you may get pegged as a tourist, it\u2019s important to know where you\u2019re going. Bring one to study during your down time or on the plane on the way there. Leave some extra space in your suitcase if you plan on shopping. If you love fashion, you are heading to the right city. NYC is all about fashion and you will have plenty of opportunities to indulge in some serious retail therapy. If you\u2019re hoping to do some shopping, leave extra space in your suitcase so you can bring your purchases home with you. Remember your essentials. While this isn't specific to New York City, it's always important to remember to bring your essentials. These include: underwear, bras, socks, a hairbrush, a toothbrush, any medications you may have, essential toiletries, phone and camera chargers, sunscreen, and anything else you absolutely must have.",
