        "Most glitter glue comes in 4-ounce (120-mL) bottles.",
        "If your bottle contains more glue, measure it out with a measuring cup.",
        "Stir in \u20444 cup (59 mL) of liquid starch.",
        "This is the magical ingredient that turns glue into slime!",
        "Measure it out, pour it into the bowl, then give the mixture a stir.",
        "If possible, use white-colored liquid starch, although pale blue will do in a pinch.",
        "You can find liquid starch in the laundry section of a grocery store.",
        "Keep stirring until all of the starch is mixed into the slime.",
        "If you need to, pass the spoon, or whatever you're using to stir the slime with, through the middle of the bowl.",
        "This will help distribute the starch more evenly.",
        "Knead the slime with your fingers, then let it rest for 3 minutes.",
        "Liquid starch can only do so much; you have to put in a little bit of extra work in order to get that glue to slime!",
        "So, take the slime out of the bowl and pull, squish, and squeeze it until it firms up.",
        "Once it sticks together, put it back into the bowl and let it sit for 3 minutes.",
        "This 3-minute wait time will allow the slime reach the right texture: not too sticky and not too thick.",

        "Finally, twist the slime together, like a candy cane.",
        "Put the slime away in a plastic, zippered bag when you're done playing with it.",
        "As you continue to play with the slime, the colors will swirl together, just like in a real galaxy.",

        "Save any unused Borax solution--you can reuse it for the next batch of slime.",
        "Knead the slime together, then set it aside.",
        "Take the slime out of the bowl and squish, stretch, and pull it between your fingers.",
        "Do this for a few minutes, or until the slime firms up; the more you knead it, the more firm it'll become.",
        "Once the slime comes together, set it aside.",
        "You may still have some Borax solution let in the bowl, which is fine.",
        "Just dump this water out; don't reuse it for the next batch.",
        "Make 2 to 3 more batches using the same recipe but with other colors.",
