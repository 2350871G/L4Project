Use scissors to cut at least six petals that are at least four inches long. If you like, you can lightly draw the petal shape with a pencil and then cut around the inside of the shape to avoid pencil marks. You can also use one of the petals as a template to cut the rest of the petals, or create six slightly unique shapes -- after all, the petals on a real flower aren't the exact same length, either. If you want to give a little extra texture to the petals, you can roll them around a pencil to make them curl upwards. You can also consider using tissue paper for the petals, or using a mix of tissue paper and actual petals. If you'd like to create less of a 3-D effect, then you can just cut one flower shape with all of the six petals connected at the center."

You can also just cut out a circle from a different color of construction paper. You can even create a three-dimensional center by wadding one piece of tissue paper into a ball and wrapping a second one around it while gathering its edges at the bottom to create a rounded top. Once you've selected your center, arrange all of the petals together in a flower-like circle. Use a glue gun, regular glue, or glue-stick to glue the center to the rest of the petals. This should secure all of the petals together and should create a nice flower-like shape. If your center is relatively small, you can also consider glueing the petals together before you put the center on for extra reinforcement."
