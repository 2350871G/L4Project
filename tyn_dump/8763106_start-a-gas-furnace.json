        "Dirty filters are a common problem that often prevent your furnace from starting.",
        "Buy a new filter at your local hardware store.",
        "Turn off the furnace and remove the filter service panel.",
        "Pull out the used filter from its slot and replace it with the new filter.",
        "Turn on the furnace.",
        "Some furnaces may have a special procedure for replacing filters.",
        "Always follow your furnace instructions for the best results.",
        "Most basic filters, like those made of fiberglass or paper, should be changed every month or two.",
        "Electrostatic and HEPA filters only need to be changed every two to four months.",
        "If you have pets, you may need to replace your filter more frequently for it to operate most efficiently.",
        "Check the thermostat settings.",
        "Make sure the thermostat is working by adjusting its temperature setting by 5\u00b0 increments until the furnace turns on.",
        "Double check that the \u201cHeat\u201d setting is selected on the thermostat.",
        "If your thermostat is not working, consult your manual for troubleshooting or replacement options.",
        "Investigate doors, covers, and registers.",
        "Many furnaces will not start if access doors or covers are not correctly reattached.",
        "Too many closed heat registers can also create problems.",
        "At most, only 20% of your registers should be closed.",
        "In a home with 10 heat registers, for example, you should only close 2 registers at most.",
        "Closing registers in unused rooms can cut down heating costs.",
        "Verify the condition of fuses or circuit breakers.",
        "If your furnace does not turn on even when power is supplied to it from the electrical panel or fuse box, you may have a blown fuse.",
        "Check the main electrical panel or fuse box of your home and any furnace fuses.",
        "Reset or replace blown fuses.",
        "The layout of your furnace will vary depending on your make and model.",
        "To quickly locate fuses for your furnace, consult the manual instructions.",
        "Furnace fuses are often found behind an electrical panel close to the main access panel.",
        "These fuses may also be positioned inside or on top of the unit.",
        "Blown furnace fuses are a somewhat rare occurrence.",
        "Replacement furnace fuses can be purchased at your local hardware store."
