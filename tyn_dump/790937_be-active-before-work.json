You will be more likely to wake up at an earlier time to squeeze in a workout if you are looking forward to what you are about to do. Think about what you enjoy doing or what you have enjoyed in the past. For example, if you used to be a swimmer and you enjoyed it, try getting into swimming again. If you enjoy running for long distances, get out there for a run before you get ready for work. If you are unsure of what exercise you enjoy doing, sign up for a free trial at a local gym and try out the equipment and classes offered there. It is common for workout studios to offer a trial class or two to find out if you would enjoy the classes offered. Take advantage of this and try out some studios in your area to find out what you might enjoy doing."
