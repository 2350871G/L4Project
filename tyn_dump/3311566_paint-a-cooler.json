Use a putty knife to fill the indents with spackle. Scrape the edge of the knife over the top of the spackle so it\u2019s flush with the rest of the cooler.

Don\u2019t forget to sand over the spackle too so it\u2019s flush with the rest of the cooler. Start sanding the cooler with a coarse grit sandpaper (40-50 grit) and finish with a fine grit sandpaper (120-220 grit). Using 2 kinds of sandpaper will help you make your cooler as smooth as possible. If the cooler came with a smooth finish, you still want to sand it down to remove the top layer of the plastic so the paint sticks."

If it is, you can add additional colors to your designs, start on a new side of the cooler, or move on to sealing the cooler. Sealing the Cooler Apply a coat of spray-on Mod Podge to the surface of the cooler. Mod Podge is a sealer and finisher that will help prevent the paint on the cooler from chipping or peeling. Once the paint on the cooler is dry, spray the surface of the cooler with a thin, even coat of Mod Podge. You can find Mod Podge online or at your local arts and crafts store. Let the first coat of mod podge dry for 15-20 minutes. After 15-20 minutes, the Mod Podge should feel completely dry to the touch. If it doesn't, let it finish drying before you move on. Apply a second coat of Mod Podge and let it dry. Two coats of Mod Podge should be enough to protect the paint on the cooler from chipping or peeling.
