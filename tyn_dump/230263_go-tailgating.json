Set up plenty of chairs for your group or extras if you're expecting friends. Have friends bring their own. Keep a few chairs around for those guest that may stop in for a while to socialize. If you get bored of watching the other sports games on TV then you can pull out a football, baseball, or other ball that you might have brought along with you to pass around with some one. Consider bringing a TV and attaching a game system with sports games or other fun games for the group attending. Many tailgaters listen to pre-game shows on the radio. Make sure you have the battery strength or pack a separate radio. You don't want to kill your vehicle battery. If your car isn't equipped you can have an A/C plug kit and inverter installed to operate electric equipment."
