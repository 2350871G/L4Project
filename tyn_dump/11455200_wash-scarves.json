Instead, find a sink, tub, or even bowl that will be large enough to completely submerge your scarf in water. Fill that sink, tub, or bowl with clean, cool water. Some washing machines have cycles designed specifically to gently wash wool. If your washing machine has such a setting, read the instruction manual before attempting to wash any of your wool scarves using this setting.
