Anodizing Aluminum Put on safety glasses and gloves. It is important to protect yourself throughout the entire process of anodizing your aluminum. Put on some safety glasses and some latex or nitrile gloves to keep your eyes and skin free from harm. You can buy gloves and safety glasses at most hardware stores.
