    "text": " Lay the sheet of paper on a flat surface. Gather your materials onto your work space.You should have:\nA mechanical compass with pencil\nA pencil eraser\nA ruler\nA spare pencil (recommended) Draw a horizontal line across the middle of the sheet. This line should be about 9 inches across. For best results, use light markings throughout each step for a finished product. Find the midway point. It should be 4.5 inches across this line. Mark it and call it \"A.\" This will be the center. Place your mechanical compass next to the ruler. Measure the width of the pencil tip and the compass needle (the sharp tip of a compass.) Adjust it to 3 inches. Place the compass needle on point A and the pencil tip on the line.  Use one hand to hold the compass handle and twist it to create a circle as shown. Be careful. The compass needle is sharp. Find the two different points at which the line and circle intersect. Label the first intersection on the left end \"B\" and the second intersection on the right end \"C.\" Place the compass needle on point C and the pencil tip on point A.  Twist your hand counterclockwise to create an arc intersecting the circle as shown.  Find the two points where this arc intersects the circle. Call the uppermost intersection point \"D\" and the lowermost point \"E.\" Using the pencil and ruler, draw a vertical line segment connecting points D and E.  Find where the line segment DE intersects the the line from earlier at a single point. Call this point \"F.\" Place the compass needle on point F and the pencil on point A.  Twist your hand counterclockwise to create an arc that intersects the line segment DE at two points.  Label the intersection between points D and F point \"G\" and the intersection between F and E point \"H\". Next place the ruler across the circle, lining it up next to points A and H. Draw a diameter containing points A and H across the circle, intersecting the circle at two different points.  Label the uppermost intersection point \"I\" and the lower right intersection point \"J.\" Next, align the ruler along points A and G. Draw a diameter containing points A and G that intersects the circle at two more points.  Label the two new intersections as follows: The upper right most intersection should be called point K. The lower left most intersection should be called point L. Place the compass needle on point K and the pencil tip on point C.  Twist your hand clockwise, creating an arc that intersects the circle at a new point. Call this point M. Place the compass needle on point J and the pencil tip on point C.  Twist your hand counterclockwise, creating an arc that intersects the circle at a new point. Call this point N. Pick up the ruler and align it against the points B and I near the upper left of the circle.  Connect the two points with a line, creating line segment BI. Repeat this step with the following points:\nPoints I and M, creating line segment IM\nPoints M and K, creating line segment MK\nPoints K and C, creating line segment KC\nPoints C and J, creating line segment CJ\nPoints J and N, creating line segment JN\nPoints N and L, creating line segment NL\nFinally points L and B, creating line segment LB Look for your octagon BIMKCJNL among arcs, diameters and line segments. Feel free to erase the extra lines. Your octagon should now look like this. You have successfully created an octagon using a compass and a straightedge. As you can see, this is why its better to use light marks. Otherwise, your drawing may have this hard-to-erase marks left over.",
