Your platform should be 1 inch wider and 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) longer than your mattress, so when you put the mattress on the finished platform bed, there will be 1/2 inch (1 cm) of platform on each side. Subtract 12 inches (30 cm) from the length and width of your mattress to get the measurements for the base of your platform. The base should be smaller than the platform to keep you from stubbing your toes on the base when you get into bed. Gather your materials. In addition to the wood for your platform bed, you will need an assortment of tools and supplies, including painting or staining supplies. Build the base of the platform using either 2-by-8- or 2-by-10-foot boards. Consider things such as baseboard heaters, outlets and the thickness of your mattress when deciding how tall to build the platform. Cut the boards to the correct size for the base and arrange them on their edges in a rectangle. Measure and cut 2 or 3 crosspieces, depending on the size of the base, to fit inside the rectangle. Space the crosspieces at even intervals. Assemble the base using wood screws. Drill pilot holes for the screws in each board and apply carpenter's glue to the cut ends to help seal the joints. Use a carpenter's square to make sure all the boards meet at 90-degree angles. Place short pieces of board in the gaps between cross pieces and screw them in place to help stabilize the base. Stagger the pieces evenly. Allow time for the glue to dry. Cover the screw heads with wood putty, then paint or stain the outside of the base. Assemble the platform in the same manner as the base, remembering that the length and width of the platform will be 12 inches greater than the base.  Set the platform on top of the base, center it carefully, and screw it to the base wherever the long boards of the platform meet the long board of the base.
