If it's not wet enough, it's more difficult to create the wet look. Blow dry your hair or let it air dry until it's just damp. You can fake damp hair at times with pomade or gel. For dry hair, use a spray bottle to make it damp. Spritz the water all over your head, using your fingers to work it in. If you need to even out the water, use a brush to help spread it out."
