It's important to read the owner's manual that came with your machine since they can vary by brand and type. Check your mixer to see if yours has a bowl that lifts up and down using a lever or if the head tilts back. Larger stand mixers usually use the bowl lift lever while lower-powered mixers often use the tilting head. Lock the bowl in place if you have a tilt head mixer. Your mixer should come with a glass or metal mixing bowl that fits on the base of the machine. Set the bowl in place and turn it clockwise until it tightens into place. Place the bowl into the machine if you have a bowl that lifts. Line up the attachments on the side of the bowl with the attachments on the sides of the mixer. Press the bowl down so it secures to the machine. You should hear a loud click as you fit the bowl in place. Secure the attachment into the head of the mixer. Regardless of what type of machine you have, get out the flat blade, dough hook, or wire whip. Line up the opening on the end of the attachment with the pin on the head of the mixer. Push the attachment up onto the pin and turn it 1/4 twist counter-clockwise. To remove the attachment, push it in a little and twist it 1/4 turn clockwise. Pull the attachment out of the machine head. Lock the machine in place. If you have a tilt head mixer, lower the head and push the lever on the side to \"lock.\" For a mixer with a movable bowl, bring the lever on the side of the machine up in a counter-clockwise movement. This will raise the bowl and lock it into place. Selecting Speeds and Attachments Turn the machine on to low before increasing the speed.
