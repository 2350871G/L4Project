                    "description": "Filling in your brows is completely optional. If you already have thick, full brows, you probably don't have to do this. Start with a medium taupe shade; it works well with dark and light-colored eyebrows without appearing too pale or too dark. If your eyebrows are red, consider a light, reddish brown pencil or powder instead. Fill in your brows using short, hair-like strokes instead of simply coloring them in. This helps mimic the texture of brow hair and provides better visual density. Use a lighter shade if you have very dark eyebrows. Never use straight black. Instead, opt for a very dark brown or charcoal. It will look softer, more natural, and less harsh. Vary the shades on your brows. You can stick with the same color, but use a lighter hand towards the inner part, and concentrate the product towards the ends."
