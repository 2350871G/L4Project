Removing Latex Paint from Paintbrushes Clean the excess paint off of your brushes. Whether you\u2019ve just painted a wall or you\u2019re digging out old paintbrushes for an art project only to find them coated in dried gunk, your first step should be to run them under a warm stream of water.

You can add more fabric softener if you feel like your mixture needs it since it won\u2019t damage your brushes. Make sure to use a container that you do not eat out of! Swirl your brushes in fabric softener for about 30 seconds. With the paintbrush facing downward, fully cover the bristles in the mixture of water and fabric softener and swirl them around. Repeat the swirling motions in opposite directions if paint is still freely flowing off of the bristles after 30 seconds. Soak your brushes in fresh, warm water.

If your brushes still have paint on their bristles after you rinse them, try soaking them in fabric softener again once they have dried. Removing Latex Paint from Skin Wash the paint off of your skin. Whether you got paint splatters on your fingers from an art project or are covered head to toe in speckles from painting your home, the best first step is to wash as much as you can off of your skin before it dries. Gently scrub the area with a soapy washcloth. Latex paint is water soluble so this step will usually do the trick! Soak your skin in hot water.
