    "text": " Basic Bow Take a long tube of PVC, and cut it into a piece about 4-feet long (120 cm) for a short bow, or 6-feet for a long bow.  Cut a small groove into the ends (to hold the string) with a hacksaw.  Take your string (preferably masonry twine) and tie a loop on one end. Then take the other end and pull it through the other groove. Pull it tight, then cut the extra string off and leave room for a knot.  Tie a knot at the end to hold the string - then you're ready to shoot with your bow.  Heavy Duty Bow Cut a line down one side of a 1/2-inch thick and 5-foot long piece of PVC pipe. Using a saw, try to cut the line as straight as possible. Spray PVC pipes with WD-40. Spray inside each end of a 3/4-inch thick and 5-foot long piece of PVC pipe, and the outside of the piece you just cut. Put the 1/2-inch thick PVC pipe inside the 3/4-inch thick piece. It will be a tight fit; you may need to use the ground for leverage. Be careful not to snap the pipe. Measure and mark 3/4 of an inch down from each end of the pipe.  Drill a hole with a 1/8-inch drill bit at each mark. Be sure the holes are aligned and even on both sides of each end. Saw through each end of the pipe down to the drilled holes using a hacksaw.  Smooth the cut sections with a metal file. You can also use rough grit sandpaper to make the cuts even smoother. Clean the bow to remove any dust. You can spray paint the bow at this point, and attach a piece of pipe insulation with electrical tape for a handle. Wrap a fiber glass rod (3/8-inch thick and 4-foot 5-inch long) with duct tape, and then with electrical tape.  Insert fiberglass rod into PCV pipes.  String the bow following steps 3 through 5 for the Basic Bow above, and you are ready to use your bow!  The Arrow Take another suitable tube of PVC.  Take a dowel and cut a grove into the end with your hacksaw for the string.  Attach fletchings if you have any. If not, attach a nail to the end with duct tape to be a weight - it steadies the arrow. Now you can shoot with your bow! ",
