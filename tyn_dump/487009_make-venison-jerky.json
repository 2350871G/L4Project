Heat the sweet and spicy jerky marinade over medium heat. Place all of the marinade ingredients into a small saucepan. Stir and heat the marinade over medium heat until it starts to bubble gently. Turn off the burner and stir the marinade until the sugar dissolves. Let it cool to room temperature before you marinate the venison in it. Mix together a teriyaki marinade. Measure savory teriyaki into a large mixing bowl and add the Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and liquid smoke. Stir in the remaining spices until the sugar and salt dissolve. If you'd like to marinate the venison in a sealable bag, pour the marinade into a sealable plastic bag that's large enough to hold the meat. Combine a spicy venison marinade. For hot jerky, mince 2 habanero peppers and transfer them to a large bowl. Stir cayenne, red pepper flakes, and paprika into the remaining marinade ingredients until they're combined. To marinate the meat in a bag, transfer the marinade into a sealable plastic bag that's large enough to hold the meat. Cut the venison into \u20444 inch (0.64 cm)-thick slices.

Set them on a plate or cutting board and use a paper towel to pat them dry to remove the excess marinade. Turn the meat over and pat the other sides dry. Using a Dehydrator Arrange the venison on the dehydrator trays. Lay the meat in a single layer so the strips aren't touching or overlapping. Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each piece of meat so air can circulate and dry the meat. Turn the dehydrator on to 150 \u00b0F (66 \u00b0C). Put the dehydrator tray with the venison in the dehydrator and close the door. Ensure that you're using a dehydrator with a temperature control instead of preset settings.

The jerky should become dry and bendable. Avoid overcooking the venison or the pieces will break in half. Conditioning and Storing the Jerky Store and shake the jerky for 2 to 4 days at room temperature to condition it. Put the cooled jerky into a glass or storage container.
