You can add the oil and salt before you boil the water, but adding it after the water has already reached a boil will speed the process up because standard water boils faster than salt water. Don't be afraid to add lots of salt. Only a small amount of the salt will actually be absorbed by the couscous. You need to add the salt to the couscous now, though, so that it can seep into the couscous as it cooks and flavor it from the inside out. The oil helps prevent the couscous from sticking together."
