This effort provides an opportunity for neighbors to meet and get to know each other, something that has become less common lately. Yet, it is crucial to include neighborhood involvement for the process to be successful. In addition to not being familiar with your neighbors, the dilemma is compounded by the fact that many adults in vulnerable neighborhoods work multiple jobs frequently with odd hours, making it extraordinarily difficult to schedule meetings and organize events. This environment also makes it challenging for neighbors to get to know and care about one another in a way that would encourage them to watch out for each other but you need to find compromises to get them together, even if it's a series of meetings at different times. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f2\\/Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f2\\/Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}"

    "text": " Establishing a Community Arson Watch Program Analyze the specific local problem and collect related data. Strategies that address the problems in a given area must be mapped out. From the outset, it is essential to facilitate neighbors working together. This effort provides an opportunity for neighbors to meet and get to know each other, something that has become less common lately. Yet, it is crucial to include neighborhood involvement for the process to be successful. In addition to not being familiar with your neighbors, the dilemma is compounded by the fact that many adults in vulnerable neighborhoods work multiple jobs frequently with odd hours, making it extraordinarily difficult to schedule meetings and organize events. This environment also makes it challenging for neighbors to get to know and care about one another in a way that would encourage them to watch out for each other but you need to find compromises to get them together, even if it's a series of meetings at different times. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f2\\/Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/f\\/f2\\/Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Get-Rid-of-Your-Ex-Best-Friend-Step-1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"} Build a partnership between fire and emergency services, the police and other law enforcement agencies, and the residents. This is often the most difficult step to hurdle because there is usually angst between the residents and law enforcement for the existing crime problem that exists in their community. Assess the needs of a given neighborhood and in the case of arson, how the fire and police departments can work with the residents. Neighborhood Watch in the USA states, \u201cIn many cases, law enforcement and community members do not have the same focus. For instance, law enforcement may be focusing their attention on a problem that the neighborhood is not concerned about, such as attempting to address major crimes throughout the city. On the other hand, community members may be more concerned about crimes such as bicycle thefts or graffiti, which are considered minor from a police standpoint.\u201d An effective Neighborhood Arson Watch program will combine the needs of the fire and police departments with those of the neighborhood when determining which problems to focus on and the methods used to address them. Set up a Neighborhood Watch program by choosing and training a dynamic group of volunteers that are led by organized and motivated leaders. If the group leaders are devoid of motivation and organization, the volunteers may be uninspired to participate and will quickly quit out of disappointment and frustration. Select the leaders wisely and give the leaders reasons to be proud of their role. Develop meaningful projects specific to the identified problem. Often, after a Neighborhood Watch has addressed its original issue, members lose interest. It is important for leaders to remain passionate and committed for the long term. One way to accomplish this is to design new projects so that there is always a goal towards which the team of volunteers is aspiring. Arson prevention projects should focus on identifying and removing what could burn or materials that an arsonist could use to start a fire, such as:\nClean up the neighborhood by removing all garbage, material, and excess vegetation that is capable of being ignited. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/87\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nRemove all possible sources of ignition such as flammable liquids and unused gas containers. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/b\\/bd\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-5Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nRemove abandoned vehicles.

You can help prevent your business from becoming one of these statistics with a few straightforward safety measures. Identify all of the means in which someone could deliberately start a fire inside or outside your business or office. Bathrooms are the leading area of origin for intentional structure fires that occurred in stores or offices. Be aware that small fires are all too often a warning of worse events to come. Have there been small fires in your business previously? Have you heard about other fires occurring locally? Be on the lookout for other forms of vandalism, including graffiti or damage to nearby businesses.  Remind employees and staff of the threat of arson and have them report any suspicious behavior. Be sure to teach them how to identify suspicious behaviors too. Perform a risk assessment. Piles of trash, rubbish, or recyclables leave the business particularly vulnerable to an arsonist providing an accessible fuel for a fire. Analyze the vulnerability of your office or business by looking at the building and what goes on within it. Note possible ways in which fires could be started deliberately. Identify the susceptible points both inside and outside the buildings and in the external areas within the building perimeter. In addition, consider the area in which your business or office is located in order to assess the likelihood of an arson attack in the neighborhood. Remove all possible sources of ignition such as flammable liquids and gases, combustible materials including trash, furnishings, and other combustible elements of the structure.  Equip your business or office with fire sprinklers. If a fire is set, having sprinklers installed is the best way to save lives and to protect your property. Arson Prevention: Places of Worship The burning of a place of worship is a stressful event; it not only devastates the affected congregation but wounds the entire community. Whether the motivation behind the arson is hate or reckless vandalism, a congregation views it as an attack on their life and beliefs. As with any arson prevention program, there are three factors which need to be addressed for places of worship: external security, internal security, and community awareness. Implement external security: Illuminate the exterior and entrances. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/88\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/8\\/88\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet1.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nUse motion-activated lighting near doors and windows. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/5f\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nKeep shrubbery and trees trimmed so the building can be observed by passing patrols. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/df\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet3.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nIf in a rural setting, ensure crops are far enough away to allow proper illumination of the area. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/aa\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/aa\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet4.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nDo not allow church signs to block the view of the building. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a7\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet5.jpg\\/v4-460px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/a\\/a7\\/Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet5.jpg\\/v4-760px-Prevent-Arson-in-Your-Community-Step-17Bullet5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":760,\"bigHeight\":570,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\"mw-parser-output\\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\\"nofollow\\\" class=\\\"external text\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\\">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>\"}\n\nMany buildings have basement entries that are hidden from view.

Arson results in major distress to students and staff along with disrupted and lost class educational time affecting learning, exams, and educational advancement. Teachers lose valuable teaching tools and resources that they have built up over their career. Schools are the heart of a local community and it is crucial to make sure they are safe. By taking some basic precautions in working practices, it is possible to minimize the risk of fire: Deter unauthorized entry into the school by posting visible signs, and while the school is closed, ensure the building is well lit, as most crimes occur under the cover of darkness.  Storage facilities and sheds used to hold sports equipment should also be well lit and located at least 10 feet (3.0 m) from the main building to avoid fire spread from these buildings involving the whole school.  Reduce the opportunity for an arsonist to start a fire by eliminating easily combustible and flammable materials located outside the school buildings. This includes the removal or locking up of garbage bins and recyclable materials. Many schools have temporary classrooms or trailers. These buildings should be fit with covers or skirts at the base to prevent combustible materials being placed underneath buildings and ignited. Block narrow spaces or alleys between buildings which provide cover to arsonists with an immovable barrier or fence.  Test and maintain all smoke alarms, automatic extinguishing systems, fire-rated doors, and lighting for evacuation, and continue fire drills. ",

        "Storage facilities and sheds used to hold sports equipment should also be well lit and located at least 10 feet (3.0 m) from the main building to avoid fire spread from these buildings involving the whole school.",

        "Many schools have temporary classrooms or trailers.",
