Pasteurized milk has been heated up to kill off bacteria, but it hasn\u2019t had the fat removed from it. You can buy non-homogenized milk at many natural grocery stores or farmers markets.

The cream will be a slightly lighter color, and might have small bubbles in it. Once you identify the cream line, you'll know how much cream to skim off the top. Open the container and scoop the cream off with a spoon. Carefully scrape the layer of cream off the top of the milk with a spoon.

You can keep your skim milk in the container that you were using, or transfer it to a separate one. Be sure to store your skim milk at a cold temperature in the fridge. Try putting skim milk into recipes as a healthier alternative to whole milk. Boiling Raw Milk to Skim It Boil your raw, non-homogenized whole milk in a saucepan for 6 minutes. Pour your desired amount of milk into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Keep the milk boiling for 6 minutes over medium heat. Stir it slightly so that the bottom of the milk does not burn. This method works best for raw milk that is warm and straight from the cow.Warning: If you smell a burnt smell, take the milk off the heat immediately. Take the saucepan off the heat and let the milk cool for 2 minutes. You will see the cream, or the fat, start rising to the top as the milk cools down. Don\u2019t stir or mix the milk once it is off the heat, or you will mix the fat back into the milk. Scoop the cream off the top of the milk with a spoon. Gently scrape the milk off the top with a large spoon. You can use the cream for a recipe or wash it down your drain. Be sure not to mix or stir the cream back into the milk. If you want to save your cream for a recipe, put it in an airtight container and save it in the fridge for up to 5 days. Cover your saucepan with a lid and refrigerate the milk for 8 hours. As it cools, the milk will separate even further and the fat will rise to the top. Make sure the lid of your saucepan is as close to airtight as it can be. Set your saucepan somewhere where it will not be jostled or disturbed. Skim the cream from the saucepan with a spoon. There will be a thick layer of cream floating on the top of your milk. Use a spoon to gently skim the rest of the cream off of the milk, making sure you don\u2019t mix it back into the saucepan.
