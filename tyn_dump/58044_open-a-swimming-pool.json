The pH determines how acidic the water is, and the wrong pH level can irritate your skin and prevent your pool from staying clean. If it still needs adjusting, use more muriatic acid to raise it or soda ash to lower it. A low pH level leads to corroded pipes and colored stains.

Use a chemical called a flocculant from a pool supply store to lower the calcium. If you need to raise it, add a hardness increasing chemical. Chlorine shock also helps raise the calcium hardness level. You will have a chance to add shock later, so you may wish to wait to treat the water if the calcium level is close to 150 ppm.

You may need to prime the filter this way a few times to get it working. If you have time, let the pump circulate water for 2 or 3 hours. Give it plenty of time to get back into working order. Conditioning the Water Add a metal sequestrant to the pool to eliminate toxic chemicals. Metal may have seeped into the water while it was stagnating over the winter. To protect your health, purchase a quality metal sequestrant from a pool supply store. Add about 0.26 US gal (0.98 L) for every 20,000 US gal (76,000 L) of water your pool holds. Let the pump circulate water for about 2 hours after you finish treating it. If you\u2019re unsure about the metal levels in the pool, get testing strips that test for elements like copper. The strips will turn colors when they detect metal. If the level is higher than recommended, add some of the sequestrant. Test the water using a water testing kit. The normal way to test pool water is to collect a small water sample in a glass and then dip a multipurpose testing strip into it. The submerged strip changes colors as it detects the properties of the water. Compare the results to the color guide included with your kit. Most test strips have separate sections for alkalinity, pH, calcium, and other factors affecting the water quality. Since your pool has been dormant, consider taking a sample to a pool supply store. Most places offer free tests and can give you recommendations on what you need to do next. Balance the alkalinity to 80 to 120 parts per million (ppm). Alkalinity measures certain substances that exist in water and have a strong effect on the pH. It can be treated by pouring different pool chemicals into the water. Add dry or muriatic acid to lower the alkalinity. Use baking soda to raise it. When the alkalinity is off, the pool water may look cloudy. Low alkalinity causes scaling on the pool walls. High alkalinity leads to stains and corrosion. Adjust the pH to be between 7.2 and 7.8. Changing the alkalinity will most likely bring the pH close to the correct range. The pH determines how acidic the water is, and the wrong pH level can irritate your skin and prevent your pool from staying clean. If it still needs adjusting, use more muriatic acid to raise it or soda ash to lower it. A low pH level leads to corroded pipes and colored stains. A high pH level can leave stains on pool equipment and encourage bacteria and algae growth. Treat the pool\u2019s calcium level so it\u2019s above 150 ppm. Calcium hardness is a measurement of how soft or hard your water is. Hard water has a lot of calcium and other elements that can cloud water. Use a chemical called a flocculant from a pool supply store to lower the calcium. If you need to raise it, add a hardness increasing chemical. Chlorine shock also helps raise the calcium hardness level. You will have a chance to add shock later, so you may wish to wait to treat the water if the calcium level is close to 150 ppm. If the water is low in calcium, it stain and abrades the pool liner. If it is high in calcium, it looks cloudy and scaly. Brush and vacuum the pool while the pump is running. Take the opportunity to clear out the remaining debris while the pump circulates the treatments you added to the water. Use a net to scoop up leaves and other big debris at the bottom of the pool. Then, use a pool vacuum to sweep debris off the pool floor. Finish up with a pool brush to scrub the walls. Cleaning the pool now prepares it to receive shock treatment, creating the perfect water conditions for swimming. Any sediment you stir up will get filtered out through the pump. Pay extra attention to the pool accessories and recesses around them. Debris often settles there and can be hard to remove. Mix shock into the pool to add plenty of chlorine to it. Chlorine shock eliminates bacteria and other remaining contaminants. Before handling the shock, put on rubber gloves and goggles for protection. Then, pour in about 2 lb (0.91 kg) of shock for every 20,000 US gal (76,000 L) of water your pool holds. Add it directly to the water, scattering it as you walk around the edge of the pool. You can also fill a bucket with pool water and mix the shock into it. If you do it this way, make sure you reserve the bucket for the brand of shock you buy. Shock is very strong and can even explode if you mix different brands. Run the pool pump for 24 hours to finish conditioning the water. Leave the pool pump and filter systems active. As long as they are working the way they should, they will mix the conditioning chemicals into the water while also separating out bacteria and debris. Check the next day for clear water to enjoy when you inaugurate your pool with the first swim of the season. If the water still looks cloudy, you may need to let it circulate for a little longer. You could also purchase a water clarifier to clear it up faster.",
