Leave it on according to the package instructions, then rinse it out. This will create a purplish base that will help your color show up better. The final result will depend on your hair\u2019s color and texture, but if you use a highly-pigmented purple dye over this base, you should get a deep, rich purple hue.

Starting with one of the front sections and working your way back, saturate the section with dye from the roots to the tips. Clip that section back up, then move to the next one. Continue until you\u2019ve dyed all of your hair. With most semi-permanent and temporary hair dyes, there\u2019s no mixing required. Unless the instructions state otherwise, all you have to do is open the container and apply the color to your hair. If the dye came in a bottle, you may need to squeeze it into a bowl if you want to use a brush. Keep in mind the bowl may get stained. Some people prefer to dye from back to front, since the back of your hair takes longer to accept color. Tip: If you can\u2019t find purple dye, try using powdered drink mix, such as kool-aid, mixed with just enough water to make a paste!"

The brush allows for precision, although keep in mind that when you shampoo, some of the purple dye will probably transfer to the rest of your hair. To minimize this, rinse your hair quickly focusing on the highlighted sections first. For instance, you might dye just the underside of your hair, or just your bangs."

However, if you\u2019re using a non-toxic dye, it won\u2019t hurt your hair to leave the color on longer if you want, and it can help produce a more vivid purple hue, especially if you have coarse or thick hair. If you don\u2019t have plastic wrap or a shower cap, you don\u2019t have to use them. However, this will help lock in the heat from your scalp, which can help the dye penetrate deeper into your hair, helping it last longer.

Once the water is clear (or mostly clear), wash your hair with a mild shampoo and rinse it again. Pour white vinegar over your hair, then rinse it well and condition your hair as usual When you\u2019re finished, towel-dry your hair with an old towel, as a little of the dye might still transfer. Do not use clarifying shampoo to wash your purple hair, as it will strip the color. Sulfate-free shampoo is best for color-treated hair. If you don\u2019t want to use vinegar, you don\u2019t have to, but it may help your new hair color last longer."

Continue until you\u2019ve dyed all of your hair. With most semi-permanent and temporary hair dyes, there\u2019s no mixing required. Unless the instructions state otherwise, all you have to do is open the container and apply the color to your hair. If the dye came in a bottle, you may need to squeeze it into a bowl if you want to use a brush. Keep in mind the bowl may get stained. Some people prefer to dye from back to front, since the back of your hair takes longer to accept color. Tip: If you can\u2019t find purple dye, try using powdered drink mix, such as kool-aid, mixed with just enough water to make a paste! Brush the dye on in sections for a highlight-like effect. If you only want to dye certain sections of your hair, clip all of the rest of your hair out of the way, then apply your purple dye with a brush. The brush allows for precision, although keep in mind that when you shampoo, some of the purple dye will probably transfer to the rest of your hair. To minimize this, rinse your hair quickly focusing on the highlighted sections first. For instance, you might dye just the underside of your hair, or just your bangs. Dye just the ends of your hair for an ombre effect. If you only want to dye the ends of your hair, you can either brush the dye on, or you can dip your hair into the bowl or container of dye. Try to create a straight line where the dye ends. If some of your hair has the last 2 in (5.1 cm) dyed but the rest only has purple on 1 in (2.5 cm), it will look messy. This is a fun way to try out a bold color without committing to an all-over look. Cover your hair with plastic wrap and leave the dye on for 45 minutes. Once you\u2019ve applied the dye, wrap your hair in plastic wrap or cover your head with a shower cap and let the dye soak into your hair for however long the directions say\u2014typically about 30-45 minutes. However, if you\u2019re using a non-toxic dye, it won\u2019t hurt your hair to leave the color on longer if you want, and it can help produce a more vivid purple hue, especially if you have coarse or thick hair. If you don\u2019t have plastic wrap or a shower cap, you don\u2019t have to use them. However, this will help lock in the heat from your scalp, which can help the dye penetrate deeper into your hair, helping it last longer. A plastic grocery bag will also work as a cover for your hair. Rinse the dye with cold water and vinegar. Once the time is up, unwrap the plastic from your hair and rinse your hair under very cool water until it runs clear. This can take a while, so be patient. Once the water is clear (or mostly clear), wash your hair with a mild shampoo and rinse it again. Pour white vinegar over your hair, then rinse it well and condition your hair as usual When you\u2019re finished, towel-dry your hair with an old towel, as a little of the dye might still transfer. Do not use clarifying shampoo to wash your purple hair, as it will strip the color. Sulfate-free shampoo is best for color-treated hair. If you don\u2019t want to use vinegar, you don\u2019t have to, but it may help your new hair color last longer. Maintaining Your Color Try to shampoo your hair as little as possible. Since most rainbow-colored dyes just color the outside of your hair\u2019s cuticle, they\u2019re going to fade a little every time you wash your hair. Try to wash your hair only every other day at the most. If your hair gets oily between washes, use dry shampoo to help keep it looking clean. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and cold water when you do wash your hair. Sulfates are harsh detergents that can strip the color from your hair. If you want to preserve your purple dye as long as possible, look for a sulfate-free shampoo wherever you normally buy your hair supplies. Hot water can also fade your color, so use the coolest water you can stand when you wash your hair. Many drugstores and supermarkets now carry affordable sulfate-free shampoos. Deep condition your hair every time you wash it. To preserve your color and keep your hair looking healthy, use a thick conditioner on your hair every time you wash it, especially if you bleached your hair. If all you have is your regular hair conditioner, apply it to your hair generously and leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes before you rinse it out. Don\u2019t forget to rinse your conditioner with cool or cold water! Boost the purple with a color refresher shampoo. If you want to keep your color looking vibrant, purchase a shampoo that\u2019s made to intensify purple color. You can also mix a little of your original purple dye with your shampoo or conditioner to get a boost of color every time you wash your hair. Reapply semi-permanent dye every 6 weeks or as needed. Semi-permanent dye typically lasts for about 6 weeks, although you will likely notice your color fading after about 3-4 weeks. You can enjoy the range of purple shades as your color fades, or you can re-color your hair to keep it looking bold and bright. Luckily, since these products are typically not damaging to your hair, you can use them as often as you like! Many semi-permanent dyes contain rich conditioners, so they can actually make your hair healthier when you use them, as opposed to permanent dyes, which contain harsh chemicals. Minimize your use of hot tools. Just like the heat from the sun, hot tools, like a flat iron or a hair dryer, will cause your color to fade more quickly as well. Let your hair air-dry whenever possible, and avoid styling your hair with heat if you can. If you do use your hot tools, set them to the lowest heat possible first, and use a heat-protectant spray.Tip: Want glam locks without your hot tools? Click through to learn how to curl or straighten your hair without heat! Avoid chlorinated pools or wear a swim cap. Chlorine is harsh on everyone\u2019s hair, color treated or not. Aside from the damage, though, chlorine will make your hair color fade quickly, so it\u2019s best to avoid getting your hair wet with chlorinated water whenever possible. If you do want to get into a chlorinated pool, try not to put your hair under the water, or wear a swim cap if you\u2019re planning on going underwater. Wear a hat if you'll be in the sun. Sunlight and heat can cause your purple hair to fade quickly. If you know you\u2019ll be spending the day outdoors, protect your hair with a hat. Wide-brimmed hats are especially effective, as they\u2019ll cast a shadow that can protect more of your hair from the sun.",

        "Since bleaching is a harsh chemical process, it\u2019s best to have it done at a salon by an experienced colorist, but you can do it yourself if you're comfortable experimenting with your hair.",
        "Most rainbow-colored dyes, including purple shades, are semi-permanent or temporary, which means they will not lighten your hair when you apply them.",

        "Only use a little, since you don\u2019t want the oil to prevent the bleach from soaking into your hair the following day.",

        "It may be helpful to have an extra pair of gloves nearby in case yours tear.",
        "Mix the ingredients according to the package directions.",

        "If you only want a few purple streaks, you only need to bleach those areas.",

        "If your hair isn\u2019t the color you wanted, you\u2019ll need to wait a few weeks before you bleach it again.",

        "Since most purple dyes are non-toxic, you can apply them immediately after you bleach your hair.",
        "Condition your hair if you won't be dyeing it purple right away.",
        "Some bleaching kits come with a nourishing conditioner.",
        "If you're using the purple dye as soon as you finish bleaching, you may choose to wait and use this conditioner after that process.",
        "If you're not planning to dye your hair purple immediately, apply the conditioner according to the packaging instructions, then rinse it out after 3-5 minutes, or as directed.",
        "Many temporary and semi-permanent dyes should be applied to clean hair, so a thick conditioner might interfere with your hair's ability to absorb the purple hue.",
        "Applying the Purple Dye Use plum or burgundy dye first if you have dark hair and don\u2019t want to bleach it.",
        "If you have dark hair and you want to dye it purple without using bleach, start by creating a base with permanent dye in a plum or burgundy shade.",
        "You can visit a stylist for this, or you can use a box dye at home.",
        "If you use a box dye, you can either apply it all over your hair or just to the areas you want to dye purple, such as highlights, the ends for an ombre effect, or the bottom layer of your hair for a peekaboo effect.",
        "Leave it on according to the package instructions, then rinse it out.",
        "This will create a purplish base that will help your color show up better.",
        "The final result will depend on your hair\u2019s color and texture, but if you use a highly-pigmented purple dye over this base, you should get a deep, rich purple hue.",
        "Keep in mind that using a box dye may be cheaper, but a color correction with a professional stylist will be expensive if you don\u2019t like your results.",
        "Protect your work area before you apply the purple dye.",
        "Rainbow hues are notorious for getting everywhere when you use them, so before you dye your hair purple, you should probably remove anything from the area that you don\u2019t want to get dye on, and lay trash bags on the floor.",
        "That way, if you spill or splatter the dye, it can\u2019t soak through and stain your floors.",
        "Also, wear gloves and old clothes that are okay to get stained, and drape a towel or hairdresser\u2019s cape around your shoulders so the dye doesn\u2019t get on your skin.",
        "You might also want to keep a damp towel nearby to clean up any spills.",
        "Tip: Wearing an old button-down shirt or bathrobe will save you from having to pull your shirt over your head when you get into the shower.",
        "Wash your hair with shampoo, then lightly towel-dry it.",
        "While most permanent dyes work best on unwashed hair, semi-permanent and temporary dyes are best applied on freshly-washed, damp hair.",
        "The color will fade with each wash, so starting with clean hair will help to reduce the amount you need to wash your hair after dyeing it.",
        "Just use your regular shampoo, then blot your hair with a dry towel to get rid of excess moisture.",
        "There\u2019s no need to condition your hair.",
        "Conditioner seals your hair\u2019s cuticle, so you don\u2019t need to apply it until after rinsing out the dye.",
        "If your hair tangles easily, you can use a small amount of a lightweight conditioner.",
        "Just be sure to rinse it thoroughly.",
        "Spread a layer of petroleum jelly around your hairline to protect your skin.",
        "Some of the dye is likely to get on your skin when you\u2019re coloring your hair, and while semi-permanent and temporary dye are typically non-toxic, it can still leave stubborn purple stains.",
        "To keep the dye off of your face, create a barrier by spreading petroleum jelly all the way across your forehead, on the tops of your ears, and behind your ears around to the back of your neck.",
        "You can also use coconut oil or even a thick moisturizer.",
        "Use a comb and clips to divide your hair into sections.",
        "Comb your hair to detangle it, then use your comb to part your hair into sections, and clip each one up.",
        "The exact number of sections you\u2019ll use will depend on the length and thickness of your hair, but the idea is that you want it to be easy to fully saturate each section with dye.",
        "If your hair is short and thin, you might only need to divide it into 2 sections in the front and 2 in the back.",
        "However, if you have very long, thick hair, you might need to clip your hair into 8 or more sections.",
