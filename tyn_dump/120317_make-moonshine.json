This can be purchased at a hardware or home and garden store. A drill with at least a 1/4\" bit, for drilling a hole in the lid of the pressure cooker. A 15 gallon (56.8 L) metal pot. A large plastic bucket. Cheesecloth. 10 pounds of cornmeal, 10 pounds of sugar and 1/2 ounce of yeast."

You may also use a screen wire or a clean white t-shirt to strain the mash. Pour the strained mash liquid into the pressure cooker. Clamp down the lid and place it on a stovetop burner. You may discard the solids that you strained out with the cheesecloth. Position the copper tubing to create a condenser. Run the copper tubing run from the lid (or vent) of the pressure cooker to a sink filled with cold water. Coil the middle of the copper tubing in the cold water, then run the other end of the tube over the edge of the sink to a clean container on the floor. Turn on the burner under the pressure cooker.
