Use an ice cream scoop to place individual servings of the ice cream on the tray from your freeze dryer or soften the ice cream slightly so you can spread it in a thin layer across the tray. If you spread the ice cream in a layer across the freeze dryer tray, you can then break it into individual pieces once it\u2019s freeze dried. If you have multiple trays for your freeze dryer, you can freeze dry more than 1.5 quarts (1.4 l) of ice cream."
