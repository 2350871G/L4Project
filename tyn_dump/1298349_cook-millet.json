Choose organic millet, if available, to gain more nutrients and to avoid potential exposure to pesticides. You can find boxes or bags of millet in the rice and grains section of the store, or bag your own from a barrel or container in the bulk section. Smell the millet to ensure its freshness. Avoid millet that appears or smells musty or moldy. Place the container of millet in a cool, dry area in your kitchen until you are ready to use it. Seal the container tightly so the millet maintains freshness. Prepare the Millet for Cooking Add at least 1 cup (approximately 236 mL) of millet into a colander. Find a colander with small holes or one designed for use with rice and grains. The amount of millet you will need may vary depending on the recipe you choose to follow. Rinse the millet under cool running water to remove dirt and debris. Keep rinsing as needed until the water appears clear rather than cloudy. Toast the millet grains in a dry pan or skillet.
