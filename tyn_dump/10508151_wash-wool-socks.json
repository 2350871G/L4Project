Even if you\u2019re only washing your socks, put all of your socks inside the bag so they don\u2019t move around your machine as much. Mesh bags can be purchased at any big box store or online. Plan on washing your socks before you go to bed so they can dry overnight.Tip: If your socks have fun designs, turn them inside out before putting them in your mesh bag. This will help preserve the colors and keep your socks looking new."

Use the amount of detergent you need for your laundry load, which should be listed on the back of the bottle.
