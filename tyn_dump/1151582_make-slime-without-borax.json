You can use rubber worms, plastic insects or eyeballs, etc. This is a great idea for a Halloween party, a science party or for a party or camp based on nature or environmental themes. Place your slime into a plastic bag. Seal the bag well to preserve it. Making Edible Slime Pour the can of sweetened condensed milk into a saucepan. You can also use a pot. Add 1 tablespoon (14 grams) of cornstarch to the sweetened condensed milk. Turn the heat on low and simmer the mixture. Stir constantly. Remove the mixture from the heat when it has thickened. Add the food coloring. Add as much as you need to reach your desired color. Allow the slime to cool. Once it has cooled, you can play with (or eat) it. Keep in mind that it might stain lighter colored clothes or carpets. Done.  Making Baby Powder Slime Pour a half a cup of PVA glue into a bowl.  Add a drop or two of food coloring.  Mix well to combine and distribute the color evenly.  Add a half cup of baby powder (talc). Add more if needed, until it reaches a slime consistency. Play with the slime. Store in an airtight container. Making Powdered Fiber Slime Mix 1 teaspoon of powdered fiber with 1 cup of water. Be sure to do this in a microwave-safe bowl as you will be putting the mixture in the microwave later. Add drops of food coloring until the water and fiber mixture is your desired color. This will be the color of your slime. It will not be diluted later. Stir thoroughly. Place the mixture and microwave-safe bowl in the microwave. Heat it on high for four to five minutes. Check on the mixture regularly to make sure that it does not boil over the bowl. Let the mixture stand for two to four minutes and stir. The mixture should be relatively cool after this amount of time. Repeat the boiling and cooling process two to six times, stirring the mixture each time you let it cool. The more times you repeat this process, the thicker your slime will be. Let the slime cool in the microwave. Let it sit for 10 or so minutes. Make sure not to handle it before it is fully cooled as it will be very hot. You can place the slime on a plate or cutting board to cool.",
