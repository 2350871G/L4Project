Open the notebook in the middle, and lay the book down flat so that the cover is facing up and the pages are facing down and are touching the surface you are working on.  Get some aluminum/tin foil and cover your notebook with it, leaving a couple extra inches on the sides of the notebook so that you will be able to tape it later.  Carefully flip the notebook around and fold the edges of the foil (the extra inches) around the cover and tape them. (Now your outside cover should be completely covered by foil. The inside of the cover should have a couple inches over it that are taped down.) Take your magazines and cut out letters that spell out your name, pictures you like, words you like, quotes you like, flowers, clothes, etc. Then you can tape all these words and images (and your name!) onto the journal. You can decorate both the front and back cover with these words and pictures. Take a clear packing tape and line the whole book with it.
