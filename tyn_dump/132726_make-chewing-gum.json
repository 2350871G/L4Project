Place the double boiler on the stove and turn the burner to medium high. Stirring occasionally with a spoon, heat the mixture until it becomes warm and gooey. You can find gum base, glycerine and citric acid at candy supply stores or online retailers. Choose a classic bubble gum flavor or go for something unique, like lemon lime. You can also add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture to color your gum. Make a double boiler if you don't already have one by finding two pots, one small and one large. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water and place it on the stove. Put the smaller pot inside the larger pot so that it's floating on the water. Place all of the ingredients except the powdered sugar in the smaller pot and turn on the burner. Bring the mixture up to temperature, stirring well."

The sap from sweet gum trees has been used for medicinal purposes and to make chewing gum since ancient times. The sweetgum is a deciduous tree commonly found in North America. Find a place where sap exits the tree. Sweetgum sap flows under the bark. You may be able to find a spot where the bark has been torn off and the sap is accessible. If not, use a pocketknife to remove the bark from a small area. You'll see runny sap underneath. Don't remove too much bark, or you'll damage the tree. Choose a spot high off the ground so that the area isn't accessible to animals. Wait for the sap to harden. Over the course of a few days, the exposed sap will begin to harden into a gum. Come back to the spot after about 3 days to check it. If the sap is still runny, wait a few more days. If it's hard, it's ready to be made into gum. Scrape the hardened resin from the tree. A pocketknife is a good tool for this. Catch the pieces of resin in your hand or a small container. Chew the resin. Place the pieces in your mouth and enjoy your minimalist gum.",
