If you are anorexic, bulimic, or exercising too much, you'll really look unhealthy and you won't have the look. If you're consuming 5,000 calories a day, never exercising, and/or letting yourself go, then you will be unhealthy and thereby unglamorous as well. Go on an ideal weight website, and calculate your ideal weight for your age and height. You should be within 12 pounds of this weight. If not, ask a doctor whether or not yours is a healthy weight."

Limit yourself to a maximum of two hours of exercise a day, but you probably only need around 15-60 minutes. Further, eat at least 1,300 calories a day if you don't play a sport or 1,700 if you do.

If your hair is just shoulder length go for a cut short style. If it's longer, try rocking long hair! Don't flat iron or blow-dry often. It's terrible for your hair and it creates frizz.

If you're plumper, and without curves wear clothes that cinch at the waist to give the illusion of curves. Don't be afraid to wear skirts. Wear tops that have ruffles along the bust. If you're plumper with curves, also look for clothes that cinch at the waist and try curvy cut jeans or skirts that cinch at the waist. If you a medium without curves, you can get away wearing lots of clothes. Avoid very low cut tops and curvy cut jeans. Try straight leg or skinny jeans. Try ruffled tops, and belts at your hips."

Next, pull all your hair into one ponytail and secure it with a hairband. By first pulling half-up, your ponytail is given a slightly different style, and more volume that will stay.
