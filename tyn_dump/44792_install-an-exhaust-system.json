The exhaust system starts with the manifold, which is the section of 4\u20138 pipes that connect to your engine guide the fumes underneath your vehicle through a metal downpipe. Look for a long pipe that has metal boxes near the front and back and  runs from the engine to the vehicle\u2019s rear. The catalytic converter is a metal box near the front of the exhaust pipe that filters out harmful gases, such as nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide. Your exhaust system may have more than 1 catalytic converter. The oxygen sensors are electronic ports that plug into the exhaust system before and after the catalytic converters to check if your engine is burning oxygen efficiently. The wires for the oxygen sensors will go directly into your vehicle\u2019s body. The resonator is a slightly wider section of your exhaust pipe that helps reduce the amount of noise when you run your engine at certain RPMs. Not every exhaust system will have a resonator. The muffler is the large metal box near the rear of your vehicle that helps reduce the amount of noise your exhaust makes.

Positioning the New System Get a new exhaust system that matches the make and model of your vehicle. Look up your vehicle\u2019s year, make, and model online or at an auto parts store to find out what systems are compatible in your vehicle. The system will contain the main exhaust pipe, catalytic converters, a muffler, and tailpipe.

Continue installing the pieces of your exhaust system as you work back toward the rear of your vehicle. Connecting the Exhaust Place a gasket over the downpipe with one of the bolts. A gasket is a thin piece that fits between pipes to prevent any leaks from escaping the connection. Hold the port at the end of the downpipe steady and lay the gasket on top of it. Slide one of the bolts through the downpipe and gasket so the threaded end points toward the rear of your vehicle. Your new exhaust system should come with a gasket, but you can also buy them from an auto supply shop. Attach the front of the exhaust system loosely to the downpipe with the bolts. Position the end of the new exhaust pipe with the port on the downpipe so the bolt holes line up. Slide a nut onto the bolt that you\u2019ve already installed and turn it clockwise by hand until it holds the new system against the downpipe. Slide the rest of the bolts through the other holes on the pipe connection and tighten them with nuts until they\u2019re halfway down the threading. Don\u2019t fully tighten the nuts and bolts yet, or else you won\u2019t be able to move the exhaust system around if you need to reposition it slightly. Connect sections of your system with exhaust clamps, if needed. Exhaust systems that come in multiple pieces will fit together easily, but they may be prone to leaking if they aren\u2019t tightened. Get exhaust clamps, which are metal loops that you can tighten around pipes to hold them together, from your local hardware or automotive store. Slide the clamp onto the section of pipe you\u2019re attaching before you connect it to the exhaust pipe. Tighten the clamp with a ratchet so it holds the pieces tightly. Working from the engine toward the back of your vehicle, connect the first exhaust pipe followed by the catalytic converters, the resonator, the muffler, and end with the tailpipe. You may also have extension pipes that connect between some of the pieces. In some cases, you may need to weld the pieces together rather than use clamps, so see what the manufacturer recommends. Systems that come in a single piece won\u2019t use exhaust clamps. Plug the oxygen sensors back into the ports on your vehicle. Locate the small holes in the sides of the exhaust pipe near the front axle of your vehicle. Slide the old oxygen sensors back into the holes and tighten them by hand by turning the bolts clockwise. Use your ratchet or wrench to fully secure the sensors so they\u2019re tight. Plug the ends of the sensors back into the wires so they\u2019ll work when you start your vehicle. You can also screw in the oxygen sensors before you install the exhaust system if it\u2019s easier to access. Slide the metal pins on the system into the rubber exhaust hangers. The metal pins will line up with the rubber hangers you already have under your vehicle. Find the hole on the hanger that\u2019s slightly smaller than the width of the metal pin and push the pin through it. Apply firm pressure until you see the end of the pin poke through the other side of the hanger. Continue putting the pins through the other hangers to secure the pipe against your vehicle. If you have trouble sliding the pins into the hangers, lubricate them with soapy water so they\u2019re easier to move. Tighten the bolts at the front of the exhaust until they form a tight seal. Go back to the front of your exhaust system and use your ratchet to rotate the nuts clockwise. Continue tightening the nuts until the pipes are firmly connected to one another and don\u2019t move around easily. Be careful not to overtighten them since you could damage the exhaust system or cause leaks. If your exhaust system came in pieces, then make sure all of the bolts are tight along the length of the pipe. Spray the connections with soapy water to see if there are any leaks. Turn your vehicle\u2019s engine so fumes run through the new exhaust system. Fill a bottle with soapy water and spray any areas where you had to connect pipes to one another. If you notice bubbles forming around the connection, tighten the bolts more to see if it fixes your problem. Try repositioning the gasket inside the pipe if you still notice a leak. If your vehicle doesn\u2019t have any exhaust leaks, you can remove the jack stands and lower your vehicle with a jack.Tip: If you still have an exhaust leak, then you may need to see a mechanic to check if there\u2019s anything wrong.",

        "Remove the pieces of the exhaust system separately.",
        "Positioning the New System Get a new exhaust system that matches the make and model of your vehicle.",
        "Look up your vehicle\u2019s year, make, and model online or at an auto parts store to find out what systems are compatible in your vehicle.",
        "The system will contain the main exhaust pipe, catalytic converters, a muffler, and tailpipe.",

        "Order the exhaust system you want so you can install it on your vehicle.",
        "Compare the layout of your old exhaust system to the new one to make sure it can fit.",
        "For example, if you have a dual-exhaust engine, then you need a system that has 2 exhaust ports.",
        "If your old exhaust system went over your rear axle, then get an exhaust system that comes in multiple pieces so you can easily install it.",

        "Apply anti-seize fluid on all of the bolt threadings.",
        "Anti-seize fluid helps prevent bolts from locking in place so they\u2019re easier to remove when you need to make repairs or buy replacements.",
        "Put the anti-seize fluid on your finger and rub it around the threadings of the bolt.",
        "Make sure that each bolt has an even coat of the fluid so it doesn\u2019t get stuck later on.",
        "You can buy anti-seize fluid from an auto care or hardware store.",
        "You can also apply the anti-seize fluid on the threadings for the oxygen sensors, but don\u2019t let the fluid touch the interior metal sensors, or else they won\u2019t work properly.",
        "Lift the new exhaust system into place using your jack.",
        "Ask a helper to guide the exhaust system underneath your vehicle without it touching the ground so it doesn\u2019t get scratched.",
