Replacing the Wheel Remove the wheel you need to replace. Begin by opening the rim or cantilever brake using the lever (if applicable). If the bike has disc brakes, remove the retaining or cotter pin or the clips or springs that hold the pads in place. Pull the pads out with needle-nose pliers and set them aside.

Then lift the bike frame up and off of the rear wheel with your non-dominant hand and unhook the chain with your dominant hand. Transfer the tire and inner tube from the old wheel to the new wheel. Let the air out of the old tire and use a tire lever to separate the tire from the wheel. Pull off both the tire and the inner tube. Reverse the process to install the tire and inner tube on the wheel that came with the conversion kit. Put the wheel with the electric hub on your bike and connect the brake components. Simply reverse the process you used to remove the wheel in order to reinstall it. Be sure to adjust the chain so it fits properly if you\u2019re replacing the back wheel. If the bike has rim or cantilever brakes, simply close them over the new wheel using the lever. If the bike has disc brakes, put the pads back in place and secure them using the clips, springs, or cotter or retaining pin. Adjust the brakes as needed, either by aligning the calipers (for mechanical brakes) or pumping the brake lever (for hydraulic brakes). Adding the Other Electric Parts Attach the speed controller and the throttle. Follow the directions in the conversion kit for installing these 2 parts using the included hardware. Use the provided bolts to secure the speed controller to the frame of the bike above the chain. Then, attach the throttle to the handlebars so it\u2019s easy to reach. If you have any other accessories, attach them as well. Secure the speed sensor to the back wheel and connect any displays and gauges to the handlebars with the included hardware. Connect the battery to the speed controller and the throttle. Follow the instructions included with the kit to connect each part. Typically, you\u2019ll only need to plug the connector on the speed controller into the connector on the battery, then repeat the process for the throttle.
