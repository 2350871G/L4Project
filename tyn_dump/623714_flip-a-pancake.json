Pay close attention to your pancake to see when this happens. If you keep burning your pancake, lower the heat when you try to cook the next one. If the center of your pancake is raw, then it means you're cooking it on too high of a heat. This makes it so the edges burn before the middle gets a chance to cook. Don\u2019t use too much butter or oil when cooking your pancake or it may spit and burn you."

                    "description": "The underside of the pancake should be a golden brown color before you flip it. You can check this by carefully lifting up an edge of the pancake with your spatula or a fork. The bottom should now feel more solid, and less like batter. Make sure to use a nonstick pan, non stick cooking spray, butter, or oil so your pancake doesn\u2019t get stuck to the pan. Don\u2019t lift one of the corners of the pancake too much or else you might break the pancake. You may check it often, but use your best judgement. The more you play around with the pancake, the greater chance it\u2019s going to break. You can shake the pan back and forth to see if it slides around. If it does, it indicates that the bottom side has cooked, and it's ready for flipping. If the center of your pancake is too wet and under cooked, there's a chance that hot oil, batter, or butter could splash onto your skin so be careful."

Don\u2019t lift it higher than 4-6 inches off the bottom of your pan. The higher you lift it, the greater chance it\u2019s going to break."
