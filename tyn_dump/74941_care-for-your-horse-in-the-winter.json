                    "description": "Deciding whether to stable your horse or not on a particular night depends on a number of factors, including the age of the horse and the weather. Sick or older horses should always be stabled on nights when severe frosts are forecasted. A healthy, rugged pony, on the other hand, might be okay staying out on a colder night with the correct rug. Your horse will likely need to come in at night at some point over the winter in order to protect him from temperature extremes, harsh wind, and snow. You will find it helpful to develop a routine where the horse goes out during daylight hours and comes back in at night. This allows him to stretch his legs and have a change of scenery, so he is less likely to become bored when stabled."

Stable blankets are ideal for a clipped horse to wear in a stable during the winter to keep the chill off. Turnout blankets are made of tougher fabrics than stable blankets and are waterproof. They are designed to have better insulation and keep the horse warmer. They also help keep the rain out. Horse sheets are not as relevant during winter. They are a lightweight cover to keep the horse clean after grooming, such as prior to attending a show."

                    "description": "When you touch a horse with your bare hands in winter, it will feel cold to you. In reality, the horse's coat and body heat do a wonderful job of insulating the horse and keeping the warmth directed into the horse. Some experts recommend that blankets only be used on horses with special needs, such as clipped horses, old horses, sick horses, thin horses, rescued horses, horses which seem cold by nature, and horses without shelter. However, this should be balanced against the severity of the weather. In snow and ice, any horse will need to be given a blanket or preferably be brought indoors. If you do use a blanket, keep using it. The horse adapts its temperature regulation to wearing a blanket. Keep in mind that your idea of cold is not your horse's idea of cold. Don\u2019t add too heavy a blanket or too many. Follow the recommended uses of the blanket by the manufacturer according to its weight. Wet cold is worse than dry cold for horses. A good quality waterproof rug is a great investment. This helps to keep your horse dry and reduces heat loss. It is possible to have a rug re-waterproofed, so be sure to keep your equipment maintained and in the best order."

It\u2019s important to know what to look for and how to manage the problems that human intervention can cause. Horses are susceptible to respiratory illnesses during winter. The ammonia buildup, mold, and dust inside barns and stables can bring on a variety of respiratory illnesses. Do your best to prevent this by ensuring adequate ventilation. You also want to clean out the stalls regularly. Give your horse plenty of outdoor opportunities to breathe in fresh air as well. Horses are also susceptible to skin conditions during winter, such as rain-rot, bed itch, ringworm, lice, and infected scratches. Keep the horse clean, groomed, and medicated appropriately. Be careful not to blanket a wet horse. Use breathable blankets that do not cause moisture buildup. See your vet promptly for treatment of skin ailments. Mud fever and rain scald are other specific skin conditions. Rain scald tends to affect the horse's back and rump (where the rain hits) wheres mud fever affects the legs (where the horse stands in mud). The softened skin allows bacteria to invade and set up infection. Crusts, scabs, and swelling develop, and the hair starts to fall out in clumps. You can treat the conditions by washing with a common disinfectant, such as Hibiscrub. However, the horse also needs to be kept in out of the weather for this to be successful."

Feeding Your Horse over Winter Use good quality hay as the bulk of the horse\u2019s feed. Since your horse\u2019s natural forage\u2014grass\u2014is unavailable, stick with good quality hay as the bulk feed source. In addition you can supplement this with high fiber foods such as sugar beet or alfalfa. These foods take a lot of chewing, which helps keep the horse occupied during the long dark hours of winter. An older horse with poor teeth may struggle with certain food sources. Try feeding older horses on haylage, or you can soak hay cubes to make them easier to chew. Don\u2019t overfeed your horse. Horses normally burn some reserves of body fat in order to keep warm over winter. If you try to avoid this by feeding energy-dense foods (such as nuts or pellets), they may become over-stimulated and buzzy. This can lead to pent up energy and possible accidents in the stable. Add mineral supplements to your horse\u2019s feed. With hay as the main food source for your horse over the winter, you may want to add vitamin or mineral supplements in order to keep the horse healthy without overfeeding. This will provide the horse with everything it needs nutritionally without adding the extra calories or too many nuts or mixes. Consult your veterinarian and the recommended servings for supplements based on what you add to your horse\u2019s diet. Riding Your Horse during the Winter Ride several times each week. Aim for four to six hours weekly of riding during winter. This is especially important if you're a competition rider or want to ensure that young horses get used to the work required of them. Use common sense when determining riding conditions. Generally speaking, if the conditions aren\u2019t safe for you to ride in winter, then they won\u2019t be safe for your horse either. There is no temperature bar to riding a horse, provided that it\u2019s not too cold for you and that your horse has adapted to the temperature, which requires regular outings.

Always remember to take a fully charged cell phone and try to stick within a signal area, so you can easily call for help. Remember, in winter, hypothermia can set in very quickly. Take proper care of your horse\u2019s hooves. Mud buildup in the hooves can cause serious thrush infections. Well-trimmed hooves additionally have a better grip on icy surfaces than neglected hooves do. If your area necessitates it, you should also invest in a hoof pick to take with you on rides. This tool allows you to remove ice and snow packed into your horse\u2019s hooves as necessary. Prepare for your chosen terrain. Even before you get your horse ready for riding, check the terrain and pasture where you plan to ride your horse. Look for ice or deep mud hazards that could cause your horse to slip or trip and make plans to avoid those areas. Add de-icing agents, such as salt or sawdust, to slippery zones around the stable, tacking areas, gateways, doorways, etc. Warm the bit before you tack up. Run hot water over your horse\u2019s bit or use a non-toxic hand warmer gel. If you don't have access to either, remove the bit from the bridle and put it in your pocket close to your skin as you prepare everything else. You can also breathe on the bit to warm it. Another alternative is to use a sweet iron bit. This isn't as harsh and doesn't become as cold as normal steel. Clean out your horse's hooves well. In addition to packing a hoof pick, add a layer of non-stick cooking spray or petroleum jelly to your horse's hooves. This will prevent balls of ice and snow from forming in the hooves. Groom your horse. This is not only good for warming the horse's muscles, but serves as an excellent warm-up workout for you too. Consider using an exercise sheet to prevent the horse\u2019s muscles from becoming cold while riding. This is especially important for a clipped or thin-skinned horse, or a horse that as been restricted to a stable. Use it while tacking up as well as riding. Tack up. Find a clear, clean spot to tack up. Avoid muddy or icy spots and find an area that has good footing. The same requirements apply to the riding area itself. Choose your riding area carefully. Pitfalls for riding during winter are varied depending on whether you're riding in snow or in more temperate muddy, cold temperatures. Things to watch out for include:\nDeep snow, especially where it conceals holes, tree wells, and crevices where your horse could slip down. Ice. Any ice is potentially dangerous as your horse has no grip or traction. Mud. While a little mud is fine, a lot of mud can cause the horse to become bogged or to trip. Mud can also conceal objects that might harm your horse. Large areas of mud are best avoided. Wet slopes. Take care riding a horse down a wet slope, as it is easy to lose grip, especially when going fast, and moving over wet stony or rocky areas. Never canter or gallop your horse in snowy, muddy, icy, or slick terrain. Cool down your horse properly after your ride. This is a time when the horse can get a chill, moving from being very hot and sweaty to being cold. You want to cool the horse down as well as taking other precautions before stabling him. This is also a good time to groom the horse again. This also helps his muscles to cool down more slowly in addition to removing mud from his legs, which can cause irritation and mud rash. Feel your horse\u2019s ears as you cool him down. If they\u2019re still hot, then you should continue walking the horse for a few more minutes. They should be cool, not cold nor hot. Cold ears mean a cold horse. Brush off snow. Any snow that has attached to your horse (especially his legs) should be brushed off. Try to do this outside to prevent taking it indoors where it can melt and become slippery. Clean the horse\u2019s hooves. Clean the hooves out the same as you did before the ride, and apply another layer of non-stick cooking spray or petroleum jelly to the hooves. This helps protect the hooves for any time the horse walks around between rides. Dry your horse. You should dry a wet horse after riding in winter. There can be snow, rain, and sweat combining to make for a very wet horse. Take a towel in each hand and rub the towels over his coat in circular motions. Roughing the hair up will help dry it faster. If your horse is used to a blow dryer, you might consider using this as well. Brush or curry your horse once he is dry. This will separate the hairs and help to keep him warm, as body heat warms the air between the coat and skin. Return your horse to his stables, barn, or field. Ensure that there is adequate food and water. Give him hay to eat, as eating roughage warms him quickly, releasing heat as it's digested. If blanketing your horse, ensure that the animal is completely dry before doing so. Be sure to check that the drinking water supplied is not frozen. Horses will drink more water if it is warmed, reducing their risk of colic brought on by dehydration.",
