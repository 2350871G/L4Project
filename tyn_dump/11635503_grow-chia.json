If a frost forms on your chia crops, they won\u2019t be able to grow properly. During the colder months, chia plants can survive between 31 and 61 \u00b0F (\u22121 and 16 \u00b0C). In the hotter months, chia plants can survive between 58 to 90 \u00b0F (14 to 32 \u00b0C). If you live in a warm climate, you can plant the seeds in October or November and harvest them in June."
