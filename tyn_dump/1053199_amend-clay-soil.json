If your water is basic, it is \"hard\" water. Hard water is generally what groundwater ends up being, mainly because it doesn't erode the pipes that contain it and transport it around. Acidic water is \"soft.\" Soft water is achieved by removing calcium and magnesium from the water. If you want to stay on the safe side, get pure, filtered water. Pure, filtered water is about as neutral as you'll get. This way, the introduction of water won't affect the pH of your soil, although it can quickly get expensive."

Builder's sand and gypsum allow for better water drainage and increased air pockets, as they force the particles in the clay apart. It is very important to use coarse sand such as builder's sand, not fine-textured sand such as play sand, as this will make the situation worse. Organic matter will help the plants get the proper nutrients and also help build increased humus (not to be confused with \"hummus\") with additional microbes that are the building blocks of good soil. Additionally, they will help lower the pH of the soil, acidifying it. Try shooting for an equal mix of coarse sand (builder's sand) and coarse organic material.
