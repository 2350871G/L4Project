To wet your sandpaper, dip it into a container of clean water, then sprinkle some additional water on top of the paper after you lay it down.

You can typically buy safety gloves and goggles at any home improvement store that also sells sandpaper. If your glass has multiple sharp edges, hold it so that none of the edges can cut your palm.

If you refrain from rotating your piece of glass, you may end up sanding one side much more than the others, leaving a noticeably uneven finish.

To make it easier to add the silicon carbide powder, place it in a small disposable cup first before you begin adding it to the glass. Place the sharp edge of the glass against the plate glass.

For maximum safety, wear safety gloves to avoid cutting your hands on the glass. Circle your hand and the bottle around the glass for 30-60 seconds.
