Pour your vinegar directly onto your clothes after you put them in the washer, and rinse them 1-3 times until the smell is gone. For best results, use white distilled vinegar. Apple cider vinegar may stain clothes. You can use either hot or cold water. Both work well when washing with vinegar. It may take several washes for the smell to disappear."

You can use either store bought brands or organic homemade soaps, such as Borax or baking soda.

Check the garment tag of your individual items to determine the best water temperature and amount of detergent. If you are washing a small load of laundry, use half of a cap full of detergent. Many detergents are scented with plant-based aromas that work well to cover up the smell. If you are sensitive to chemicals, this may not be the best suggestion for you. If an item is hand-wash only, do not put it in the washing machine. Instead, wash your garment by hand using 1\u20132 US tbsp (15\u201330 mL) of scented detergent."
