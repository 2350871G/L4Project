This enables you to freeze the okra before it starts degrading, and will result in the best-tasting okra later on. If you don't grow your own okra or can't get to a farm, try buying it a farmer's market or from a store that regularly restocks. You don't want okra that's been sitting on a shelf for several days. Wash the okra. Rinse away dirt and debris using a steady stream of cool water. Handle the okra gently, massaging away dirt instead of scrubbing it off.
