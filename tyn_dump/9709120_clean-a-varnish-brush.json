Washing Varnish Brushes Avoid using detergent or paint stripper to wash a varnish brush. Most cleaning detergents will damage your brush's bristles, and paint stripper is strong enough to warp your brush's shape. To keep from damaging your varnish brush, stick to dish soap and water. Wash the brush with dish soap under warm running water. Rub dish soap into the brush bristles and work it into a lather. Keep the brush under the running water until it no longer has any soap bubbles in its bristles. Avoid using hot water, which can damage the brush. Rinse the brush until the water runs clear. If your varnish has a tint, you may be able to see discoloration in the water. Hold the brush over the running water and check the color of the water that runs off your brush bristles. When that water is no longer tinted a certain color, it is clean and ready to dry. You may not, however, notice any discoloration if the varnish is transparent. In this case, wash the brush until it no longer seems glossy or coated in a substance. Drying and Storing Brushes Dry the bristles with a clean cloth. After rinsing out the varnish brush, take a microfiber brush and wipe it over the bristles. Continue wiping until the brush no longer drips and is slightly damp. Wipe in the direction that the bristles run rather than against it to avoid bending them. Wrap the bristles with the non-sticky side of a piece of duct tape. Cut a piece of duct tape long enough to wrap around the brush. Wrap the non-sticky side around the middle of the bristles to hold them in place as they dry. Then, cut a piece of duct tape of an identical length and cover the sticky side so you can handle the brush easily. Do not wrap the bristles with the sticky side, as this can bend or pull them out. Leave the varnish brush out to dry for 24 hours. Let the brush dry for at least 24 hours, or until it no longer seems damp. Avoid touching your brush, particularly the bristles, while it is drying. Moving the bristles too much as they dry can cause them to lose their shape. Remove the duct tape before storing your brush. After your brush has finished drying, it no longer needs duct tape to protect the bristles. Slide the layer of duct tape off of your brush and dispose of it after the full 24 hours have passed. Keep your varnish brush in a dry box with a tight lid. When the brush is dry, store it in a dry box with a tight-fitting lid until you're ready to use it. This will prevent your brush from molding or mildewing. Do not store your brush in water or mineral spirits.
