Using rough sponges and boat solvents, like Awl-Prep, scrub away the waxy finish. Generally, running your finger along the surface, top or bottom, will tell you if there is still a coating-- it feels like a candle or a freshly waxed car. If you are in any doubt about the coating, go over the boat again -- paint will not stick to this waxy surface, so it all needs to go."

This gives the paint a surface to \"grip\" to and promotes an even coat of paint. When in doubt, sand away all of the old paint. There are several important considerations to take when sanding:\nIf the old coat of paint is flaky or damaged you will need to strip it and sand it away entirely. If the old paint is a different type than the one you plan to apply (non-vinyl vs vinyl paint), then remove it entirely. Never use a belt sander on your boat\n\nWarning: wear a respirator and eye protection when sanding, as paint chips are toxic."
