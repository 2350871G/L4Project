Try to use pins that are at least 1 in (2.5 cm) long, so you have enough room to bend and twist the end of the wire later on. Depending on the supplies you have, you can also use a small or medium-sized pearl. Head pins have a solid ball at the end of them, which prevents the beads from sliding off. While similar to straight pins, these items are used specifically for jewelry making. You can find head pins at most craft stores. You can custom order real pearl beads from online craft stores."

The necklace is usually a small jewelry chain or a thin piece of wire. If you\u2019re using a jewelry chain, attach the pearls to an individual chain link. If you\u2019re using a piece of wire, use a jump ring to thread the pearls onto the piece of jewelry.Tip: If you\u2019re aiming to make a necklace with multiple pearl clusters, use a chain.
