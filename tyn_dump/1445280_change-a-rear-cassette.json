Even older sprockets can be used with some adjustments. To get sprockets, buy them separately or as a whole unit. Cassettes can be disassembled by removing the pins holding them together, the pins have no other purpose than to make assembly easier. Then just stack together the cassette with the gear ratios you want. Some sprocket tooth counts are less common than others, keep that in mind when buying as you might end up with sprockets identical to what you've already got. It's tricky to mix and match gears, so it's best not to try unless you're experienced. Additionally, compatibility between gears and cassettes can vary. For example, a SRAM cassette may be compatible with a Shimano freehub body, but the new SRAM XD driver series isn't compatible with any older model cassettes. Similarly, Campagnolo freehub bodies are only compatible with Campagnolo cassettes. If you're in doubt about which one to use, consult your local bike shop. Note that changing gear ratios could require a longer or shorter chain to fit on new sized sprockets. The replacement cassette should have the same number of gears. For example, replace a 10-speed cassette with a 10-speed cassette instead of a 9- or 11-speed cassette."
