You won't be able to make multicolored roses like you can with open flowers unless you use patterned paper. Start with whatever size tissue paper you can find.

Be sure not to leave jagged ends where you cut. Sharps ends can both prick you and tear the paper rose. A shorter green pipe cleaner may be used instead of heavy wire. Fold the wire into thirds to make it the right thickness for a stem. Twist the wires together for a neater look. If you have trouble doing this by hand, use a pair of pliers. Wrap green florist tape around the wire to cover it completely. If you're using pipe cleaner, skip this step. Cut out the leaves. Use green tissue paper. Cut out four ovals per flower in the shape of a leaf. The leaves should be as long as either the diameter of the petals for the open flower or the height of the quartered tissue paper for the closed rose. Roll the leaves around a pen. Bunch the leaves over the bottom end of a pen as described in Step 3 of Method 1. Curling them slightly gives them a more realistic look.
