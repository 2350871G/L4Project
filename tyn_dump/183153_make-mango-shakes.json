Place the mango pieces into a blender or, if you're using puree, just pour the puree into the blender. Blend the fruit until it has a smooth texture. Add the milk or soy milk. Turn the blender on and gradually add ice cubes, ice cream, or frozen yogurt until you achieve the thickness that you want. Taste the mango shake for sweetness. Add sugar if needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, and blend the shake to distribute the sugar. Pour the finished mango shake into a serving glass.  Serve the shake. You can garnish your shake with fresh mango slices, if desired. Strawberry Mango Shake Place the strawberries and mangoes into your blender.  Add the ice cream.  Blend all of the ingredients until they are smooth. Add the milk 1 tablespoon at a time, blending it after each addition, until your shake is the right thickness. Pour the shake into a glass and serve it.  Banana and Mango Shake Place the banana and the chopped mango or mango puree into the blender.  Add the milk, orange juice, lime juice, sugar and ice cream or yogurt.  Blend everything until the shake looks frothy and well-mixed.  Pour the shake into a glass.
