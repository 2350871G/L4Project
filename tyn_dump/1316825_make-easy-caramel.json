    "text": " Cooking it on the Stovetop Measure out the ingredients before you start cooking. Timing is very important when making caramel, since it can easily burn, and you don't want to have to search around your kitchen for a measuring cup while your sugar is boiling. Place a heavy-bottomed saucepan on the stove. A two to three quart pan works well. Be sure to use one that's nice and heavy, so it cooks the sugar evenly. Caramelize the sugar. Pour the sugar into the saucepan, and turn the heat to medium high. Start whisking it immediately so it doesn't burn, and keep going as it comes to a boil and begins to melt. Stop stirring once all of the sugar granules have melted. Be sure to stand there stirring the entire time, since sugar can quickly overcook once it's caramelized. If you cook it too long, the caramel will come out hard or even burn. Add the butter to the pot. Be careful, since this will cause the mixture to froth up. Continue to whisk until the butter is completely melted. Take the pan off the heat. Wait 10 seconds or so for the mixture to stop boiling. Stir in the cream. Pour it slowly into the pan, and continue whisking until the caramel is smooth. Add the salt and vanilla, and other flavorings. Sprinkle the salt over the caramel and pour in the vanilla, along with any other flavorings you want to use. Stir until they're well incorporated throughout the caramel. Return the pan to heat and bring the caramel to a boil. Reduce it to a simmer and cook for one more minute before removing it from heat. Allow it to cool. Once it is no longer piping hot, transfer to a heat-proof jar or container. Store your homemade caramel in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Cooking it in the Microwave Melt the butter in a glass microwave-safe bowl. Cook it on high for about 30 seconds. If it needs more time, keep cooking until it's entirely melted. Remove it from the microwave. Don't use plastic when you're cooking caramel in the microwave. The sugar gets very hot, and can destroy the bowl and cause a mess. Be sure to always use glass instead. Mix in the brown sugar and heavy cream. Pour them into the same bowl with the butter. Use a spoon or whisk to mix well. Microwave on high for a minute and a half. This should be enough time for the mixture to get hot and bubbly. If it needs more time, cook it for an extra thirty seconds. Be careful not to cook it for too long, or it could overheat and cause a mess in your microwave. Handle the bowl very carefully once you add the sugar, since it will get quite hot.
