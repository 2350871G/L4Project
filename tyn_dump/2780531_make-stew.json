Heat a Dutch oven or a skillet over medium high heat. Add 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of oil to coat it. If you plan to cook your stew in a Dutch oven, you may want to Saut\u00e9 the aromatics before browning your meat and use the same pot. Saut\u00e9 the vegetables for approximately 5 minutes until softened.  Place them in a bowl to be added back in later on.  Brown the Meat Decide upon a meat, such as chicken, pork or beef. If you plan to use seafood, it should be added near the end because it cooks more quickly. Stew meats are generally less expensive, tougher cuts of meat. The braising process breaks down the fats in the meat, tenderizing them. Choose meats like pork shoulder, chicken thighs, chuck roast, bottom round, or even meats labeled \"stew meat.\" Defrost the meat in a refrigerator overnight. Defrosting in the microwave right before can change some of the stew flavors because it may cook some of the meat too quickly. Cube the meat. Cut 1 to 2-inch (2.5 to 5cm) pieces of meat. The size will depend upon your preference. Generally, the longer the cooking time, the bigger your pieces of meat should be. You do not want your meat to overcook. Not all meat needs to be cut before adding it to a stew. Chicken thighs, chicken wings and short ribs can be cooked with the bone in and removed while eating. Pour a cup of flour into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Dredge your meat pieces in flour. This will give them a crispy edge and give the stew a more complex flavor. Heat your skillet or Dutch oven over medium high heat. Pour 1 to 2 tbsp. (15 to 30ml) of oil into the bottom of the pan to coat it. Pour the meat into the skillet. Brown it on all sides. This should take approximately 5 to 8 minutes with 2 lbs. (0.9kg) of meat. Remove the meat from the skillet and place it in a bowl. Place a towel or foil over the top to keep it warm. Deglazing Keep the skillet/Dutch oven that you've used to Saut\u00e9 and brown your ingredients on medium high heat.  Pour 1 cup (236ml) of wine (white or red), beef or chicken stock or cider into the bottom of the pan. Make sure it covers the entire bottom, adding more if necessary. Allow the acidic liquid to heat for 2 to 5 minutes.  Loosen the browned ingredients on the bottom of the ban with a wooden spoon. Make sure you loosen and incorporate as many as possible of those bits. It will strengthen the flavor. Stewing Ingredients Pour the browned meat and aromatics back into the Dutch oven. If you are using a slow cooker, you should add the deglazed sauce, meat and aromatics to the crock pot now. Pour enough stock or stock and water to cover the ingredients. If you are using a slow cooker, you should only cover approximately half of the volume of the ingredients with your liquid. The cooker will concentrate all the steam and juices inside the pot. Add spices to the mix. Bay leaves, salt, pepper and thyme are frequently used with stews, but you should adjust your spices according to the flavors you prefer.

If you are cooking a stew in a slow cooker, it will need to cook for 4 hours on the high setting or 6 to 8 hours on the low setting. Adding Vegetables Cut up root vegetables, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, turnips, parsnips, rutabaga or carrots. Add them during the last 20 to 30 minutes of your simmering. If you add the root vegetables too soon, they will be mushy. Test the meat and root vegetables with a fork. If they are tender enough to break away with only a fork, the stew is ready to serve.
