Studs are essential for all but the lightest pictures and frames, as hanging heavier objects from plain drywall can cause tears over time. Electronic stud finders are available in any home supply or hardware store. Most are used by pressing them to the wall and running them along it until a stud is found, whereupon the stud finder will beep and/or light up. Read the instructions for your electronic stud finder carefully. Many stud finders have two sets of indicators: one for studs, and one for live electric wiring. Be sure you know which indicator is which before driving your fastener into the wall. If you don't want to purchase an electronic stud finder, you can use your hand to estimate where studs are. Rap the wall with your knuckles and listen carefully until you get a very shallow and dull sound from it. That spot is where a stud is hiding. To double-check that you have found a stud and not something else, knock around for other studs. They are normally spaced between 15 and 24 inches from each other. If you are able to discern a regular pattern, it is likely that you have indeed found a stud."

The humble finish nail, which is 1\u00bd to 2 inches (5.1 cm) long and bears up to a few pounds even without a stud, is fine for lighter pictures, but a drywall anchor is the safest choice. There are a variety of other options for smaller pictures available at any hardware store, including various hooks, load-bearing adhesive tape, and more complicated devices like tremor hangers."

Next, measure down from the top of the frame to the hanging bracket or wire on the back of the frame. Subtract this small measurement from the frame height measurement to determine where on the wall you should insert your anchor so that the center of the picture will be at the desired height. If your picture has a wire hanger, pull the wire up towards the top of the frame until it is taut before measuring, since this is where the wire will be once it is hung on the anchor."

Attach your bracket well above the center of the frame on the back side, so that gravity will do most of the work of keeping the picture steady. Positioning and Centering Find the right height. Plan to hang most of your pictures at roughly eye level for a pleasing effect. The center of your picture should usually end up between 57 and 60 inches from the ground. Measure it out with a tape measure and lightly mark the proper height with a pencil. Feel free to adjust the center height of your pictures based on your own height or the height of the room you are decorating. These numbers are only a guideline.

If your picture has a wire hanger, pull the wire up towards the top of the frame until it is taut before measuring, since this is where the wire will be once it is hung on the anchor. Hanging the Picture Make a pilot hole. Find the point you noted or marked where the picture will hang from, and make a small hole in it for the stud anchor. If you have a power drill, use a small drill bit and drill in until you feel or hear the bit hit the stud. Otherwise, use a finish nail and a hammer to make the hole. Install the stud anchor. Again, this is easiest with a power drill and a screwdriver tip, but a manual screwdriver can also be used. Set the point of the anchor screw into the hole you made and screw it into the wall. It will thread into the stud, creating a strong hanger for your picture. Once the anchor is set, continue screwing it until it is an appropriate length from which to hang your picture. Hang the picture from the stud anchor. If it slips off easily, unscrew the anchor a bit and try again. If there is a gap between the top of the frame and the wall, screw the anchor in a little more and try again. Once the picture hangs securely and flatly against the wall, no further adjustments to the anchor are needed. Straighten the picture. Set a level on top of the frame and gently adjust the picture until the level reads flat and even. Step back and enjoy the way your new picture hangs on the wall. Be sure to clean up any tools and debris afterward. Tips for Hanging Multiple Pictures Don't stress studs too much.
