Measure out 1 tbsp (15 mL) of contact saline solution and add it to the bowl. Give the mixture a stir until the ingredients come together. Keep stirring until the slime leaves the sides of the bowl. Use a contact saline solution that contains \"boric acid.\" Check the ingredients label on the bottle. Knead the slime, then add more contact solution, if desired. Pick the slime up with your hands. Pull it between your fingers, then squish it back together. Do this a few more times until the slime feels less sticky. If the slime still feels too sticky, add 1/2 tbsp (7.5 mL) of contact saline solution, and knead again. Make more colors of slime and mix them together for a unique effect. Repeat the process for each color that you want to make. Once you have made all your colors, you can squish them together into a big blob. The colors will create a streaked, galaxy-like effect. Keep the slime in a sealed container when you're not using it. Like all good things, this type of slime does not last forever. It will eventually dry out, especially if you play with it a lot. Once the slime starts to turn dry and hard, it is time to throw it out and make a new batch. Ready to make another batch of slime? Try mixing up a batch of clear slime, glossy slime, or butter slime next!",
