                    "description": "This method requires no special tools, but does take a significant amount of prolonged rubbing. It is especially suited to stains on natural fibres such as linen and cotton. Fabrics whose surfaces fragment into small round surface balls, known as \"bobbles\" or \"pills,\" require a longer period of more gentle rubbing. These fabrics include wool and most artificial fibres."

Run cold water over the back of the fabric, so it pushes through the stain. Hold the fabric in the running water for several minutes, and the stain should be at least slightly smaller. Warning: never wash a blood stain in warm or hot water, which may cause it to bond permanently to the fibres of the fabric."

Rub the stained fabric against itself vigorously, or gently but quickly if the fabric is delicate. The friction you generate should slowly loosen the remaining particles of blood, which will remain in the lather rather than re-adhering to the fabric.

        "Do not use seasoned meat tenderizer, as the seasonings may stain your fabric.",
        "Rub the paste gently into the fabric.",
        "Spread the paste on the dried blood stain and gently rub it with your fingers.",
        "Let it sit for about an hour.",
        "Rinse out the paste before washing.",
        "After the hours is up, rinse the paste out with cold water.",
        "Wash the fabric as usual, but air dry rather than using a drier, since the heat can cause remnants of the stain to set permanently.",
        "Using an Enzymatic Cleaner Do not use this method on wool or silk.",
        "Enzymatic cleaners break down proteins that form stains.",
        "Since blood stains bond to the fabric using proteins, enzymatic cleaners can be highly effective at removing them.",
        "However, wool and silk fibres are made from proteins, and may break apart if exposed to an enzyme product.",
        "Find an enzymatic cleaner.",
        "If you are having trouble finding a cleaning product labeled \"enzymatic\" or \"enzyme cleaner,\" try a \"natural\" or \"earth-friendly\" laundry detergent or laundry pre-treatment, which often contain biodegradable enzymes.",
        "Nature's Miracle and Seventh Generation laundry detergent both fall in this category.",
        "Flush the fabric with cold running water to loosen some of the dried blood.",
        "Agitate the fabric with your fingers to help scrape off the crusted material, or scrape it off using a blunt knife.",
        "Soak the fabric in cold water and enzymatic cleaner.",
        "Dissolve about 120 mL (1/2 cup) of the cleaner in a bowl of cold water, then submerge the stained fabric.",
        "The soaking time will depend on how old the dried blood stain is, and how strong the cleaning product is.",
        "Soak at least one hour, or for as many as eight.",
        "Optionally, scrub the cleaner into the stain with a toothbrush before submerging.",
        "Wash the fabric and let dry.",
        "Wash the fabric as usual, but do not put it in the drier, which may cause the blood to permanently set.",
        "Let it air dry, then check whether the stain is still present.",
        "Using Lemon Juice and Sunlight Use this method in sunny weather.",
        "This method uses common ingredients, but requires sunlight to finish the process.",
        "You will also need to wait for the fabric to air dry before you can tell whether the stain was successfully removed, making it slower than most other methods.",
        "Warning: lemon juice and sun are both capable of harming delicate fabrics, especially silk.",
        "Soak the stained fabric in cold water.",
        "Submerge the fabric in cold water for a few minutes.",
        "While it is soaking, gather up the other materials you will need.",
        "This includes lemon juice, salt, and a zip lock plastic bag large enough to contain the clothing.",
        "Wring the clothing gently and transfer it to a bag.",
        "Twist the clothing to remove some excess water.",
        "Untwist it and transfer it into a large, resealable plastic bag.",
        "Add lemon juice and salt.",
        "Pour about 500 mL (2 cups) lemon juice and 120 mL (1/2 cup) salt into the plastic bag and seal it.",
        "Massage the fabric.",
        "With the bag closed, press the contents together to work the lemon juice into the fabric, focusing on the stained areas.",
        "Some of the salt should dissolve, and may help rub the lemon juice into the fabric, or abrade the stain itself.",
        "Remove the fabric after ten minutes.",
        "Let the bag sit for ten minutes.",
        "Take out the fabric from the bag and squeeze out the excess lemon juice.",
        "Dry the fabric in the sun.",
        "Hang the fabric on a clothesline or clothes horse, or spread it on a flat surface and leave it to dry.",
        "Do this in a sunny area, not just in front of a heater.",
        "It may feel stiff once dry, but this should go away once the item has been washed normally.",
        "Wash the fabric with water.",
        "If the blood stain is gone, wash the fabric with water to remove all the lemon salt solution.",
        "If the blood stain remains, moisten the fabric and let it dry under the sun again.",
        "Trying Stronger Treatments Understand the risks.",
        "The substances used in this section are powerful stain removers.",
        "However, due to their strength, they may bleach your fabric or cause permanent damage to the fibres.",
        "These methods are best used on white, non-delicate items, or as a last resort after other methods have failed.",
        "Test on a corner of the item first.",
        "Once you've acquired one of the following solutions, use a cotton ball or paper towel to dab a small amount on a corner or hidden area of the fabric.",
        "Let it sit for five to ten minutes to see whether it stains your fabric.",
        "Consider using white vinegar.",
        "Vinegar is not typically as strong as the options below, but still has the potential to harm fabric.",
        "Soak the stained fabric in white vinegar for about thirty minutes, then rub the stain with your fingers as you rinse it in cool water.",
        "Repeat if the stain is noticeably improved but still present.",
        "Try hydrogen peroxide.",
        "A 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is the strength it is typically sold at, can be poured directly onto the stain or applied with a cotton ball.",
        "Be aware that it will likely bleach colored fabric.",
        "Keep the fabric in a dark place for 5-10 minutes, since light breaks down hydrogen peroxide, then blot with a sponge or cloth.",
        "Test an ammonia mixture instead.",
        "Start with \"household ammonia\" or \"ammonia hydroxide,\" sold as a cleaning product.",
        "Dilute this with an equal amount of water, and leave it on the stain for fifteen minutes before blotting and rinsing.",
        "If your \"test corner\" showed signs of damage, you may wish to soak the fabric in a much weaker solution, such as 15 ml (1 tbsp) household ammonia, 1 L (1 quart) water, and a drop of liquid handwashing detergent.",
        "Warning: ammonia may destroy the protein fibres that form silk or wool.",
        "Household ammonia is approximately 5\u201410% ammonia and 90\u201395% water.",
        "Stronger ammonia solutions are highly caustic, and should be diluted even more."
