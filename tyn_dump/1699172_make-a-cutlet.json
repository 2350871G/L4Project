Cut along both edges of the plastic bag so you can open it up into one flat sheet. Place your cutlet on one side of the plastic sheet and fold the other half on top of it. Pound the cutlet with a meat mallet until it is \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick. Keep a tight grip on the mallet. Hit the meat firmly but not so hard that you will pound holes into it.

You can even make a cutlet burger by putting the cutlet inside a hamburger bun and adding ketchup, mustard, lettuce, tomato, or whatever other hamburger toppings you enjoy. Make breaded cutlets for a tasty, crispy dish. Bread your cutlet by putting 1 \u00bd cups (150 g) dry breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup (64 g) all-purpose flour, and 2 eggs into 3 separate shallow bowls.
