To remove the knockout plate, simply grip with the pliers and move the metal back and forth until it comes away. Clean all foreign objects out of the panel and reinstall the cover. Remove any tools, wire scraps, or other foreign objects that could cause a short circuit from the interior of the panel. Then, place the cover on the panel to check that the circuit breaker has fully been seated at both contact points and fits through the cover. Finally, rescrew the cover onto the panel. Turn on the main breaker and test your new circuit breaker.
