The most common round pen size is 60 feet in diameter. But you can create a pen that is anywhere from 40 to 120 feet in diameter, depending on how much room you would like for you and your horse."

To use dirt: Till the soil with a garden tiller, loosening the soil at least 4 inches deep. You may have to till the footing often, as dirt compacts with use and can create a hard top layer that can injure your horse\u2019s legs. Keep in mind that in rainy climates, the dirt will turn to mud and you won\u2019t be able to use the pen if its muddy. To use sand: Start by adding a layer of gravel. Use a shovel or rake to distribute the gravel. Then, spread a layer of sand on top of the gravel, using the rake. Sand provides good drainage and soft footing. For wetter climates, it's a good option. To use wood shavings or mulch: Start by adding a layer of gravel. Then, spread a layer of wood shavings or mulch on the gravel. These materials make good footing because they create a cushion over the ground. But if they go too wet, they can become slick. They also tend to break down easily and turn into dirt over time. To use shredded rubber: Start by adding a layer of gravel. Then, spread a layer of shredded rubber over the gravel. Shredded rubber helps to drain water and provides good footing. But high winds can blow the rubber pieces away in the pen. To use a combination of materials: Start with a coarse layer, like gravel, to help with drainage. Then, add a finer layer of wood shavings or shredded rubber  to prevent the top layer from washing away. Add a cushioning layer made of sand to the top to create good footing for your horse."

They are also very durable and can withstand a lot of use. But these panels do not \u201cgive\u201d if you or your horse falls into them.

        "Dig holes for the other posts.",
        "If you have rocky soil, it may be best to have longer intervals between the posts so you have less holes to dig.",
        "Place the posts in the holes and fill the holes with cement.",
        "Soak the pressure treated boards in water until they are soft and pliable.",
        "Make a solid wall by attaching them to the insides of the posts.",
        "Stagger the boards on the posts to distribute the pressure evenly.",
        "Cut the remaining boards to the height of your fence and nail them vertically to the inside to cover the joins at the posts.",
        "Alternatively, you can create a more open pen by using electric braid instead of wooden boards.",
        "Attach 4-5 strands of electric braid between the posts.",
        "Depending on how high the posts are, you may use more or less strands of braid.",
        "Be sure to put enough tension on the braid to prevent sagging between the posts.",
        "You may also want to also add a top railing made of wood to the pen to give it a more sturdy appearance.",
        "Install the gate.",
        "You will want a gate big enough for a horse to in and out of the pen, but not large enough for a tractor or multiple horses to pass through.",
        "Make a gate out of wood or wood and braid.",
        "Using the gate posts you built earlier, hang the gate.",
        "Attach a latch made out of wood or braid to the gate.",
        "You can also purchase ready made metal or wood gates.",
        "Maintain the wooden pen.",
        "If you used pressurized lumber or treated wood posts, they should hold up pretty well.",
        "You can also prime, stain, or paint the wood posts and rails to maintain them.",
        "Using Steel Pipe Panels Determine how many panels you will need.",
        "To do this, multiply the diameter of the area by 3.14 to determine the pen\u2019s circumference.",
        "Then, divide the circumference by the length of the panels you are going to use.",
        "For example: if you plan to use 10 foot panels to construct a 60 foot pen, multiple 60 by 3.14 to get a circumference of 188.4.",
        "Then, divide 188.4 by 10 (panel length) to get 18.84.",
        "So, you will need 19 panels for a slightly larger than 60 foot pen.",
        "If you are going to be adding a separate gate piece, make sure you factor in its length when calculating the overall diameter of the pen.",
        "Purchase panels online or at a pet supply store.",
        "Look for panels made of high quality galvanized steel, with a clear coat finish that protects the steel from rusting.",
        "Set up the panels in the pen area.",
        "Lay them on their sides so that the inside and outside tabs line up with each other.",
        "Some panels have a quick pin latch system with built-in pins.",
        "This prevents the pins from getting lost when you move the panels.",
        "Stand two panels up, side by side.",
        "Make sure the tabs are overlapping.",
        "Insert the panel pin between the tabs to connect them together.",
        "Continue with the other panels until they have all been mounted.",
        "Many panels will be built with mud legs to prevent them from sinking into the ground.",
        "Maintain the steel pen.",
        "If the panels are made of high quality steel with a good coating, they should not fall apart easily.",
        "Be wary of rust.",
        "If the panels start to rust, paint them with a rust resistant paint.",
        "If the panels get dirty, simply wipe them off with a cloth."
