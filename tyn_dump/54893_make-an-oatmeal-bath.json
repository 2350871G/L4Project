No need to get too fancy\u2014the kind of normal packaged oatmeal you\u2019d find at the supermarket will work just fine. Blend the oats until they reach a very fine, powdered texture. This will help them dissolve more easily in the bath. The oatmeal particles must be very small in order to spread through the bathwater without simply sinking to the bottom of the tub. If you\u2019re not sure whether the oatmeal has been ground fine enough, try testing it by blending about a tablespoon into a bowl of warm water. If the water becomes a uniform, milky color, the oatmeal will dissolve in the bath."

Roughly one cup of ground oatmeal, along with any other additives of your choosing, will be the perfect amount to add to a full bathtub.
