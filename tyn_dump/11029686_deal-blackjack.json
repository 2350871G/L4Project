The cut card is a solid red card placed in the deck that marks where the cards should be separated during the cut. It's not totally necessary, but it can be helpful when cutting the deck. If you\u2019re playing with a large group, you can combine up to 6 or 8 decks to change the odds of the game.Tip: If you have a card shoe to make it easier to deal, set the cards inside so they\u2019re face-down and easy to pull from the slot."
