        "Portion the puree into bags, jars, or ice cube trays.",
        "To make thawing your spinach puree as easy as possible, it's best to portion out just what you think you'll need at a time.",
        "To do that, you can divide the puree into snack-size freezer bags or freezer-safe baby food jars, or you can pour the puree into an ice tray to get small cubes.",
        "If you freeze the spinach in ice cube trays, wait until it's frozen, then pop out the cubes and transfer them to a freezer bag or another freezer-safe container.",
