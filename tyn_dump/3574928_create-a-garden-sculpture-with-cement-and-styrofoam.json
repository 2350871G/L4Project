Make sure to use a water based glue because other solvents will probably dissolve the styrofoam. Test your glue before proceeding."

Note that the styrofoam will be covered by 5 cm (2\") or so of concrete, so try not to carve too much detail-- it will most likely be lost.There are two main ways of carving foam-- heated carver and sharp knife:\nThe heated carver will give off toxic fumes so please make sure you are in a well ventilated area. The sharp knife (or box cutter) will make an enormous mess, so be prepared to sweep and vacuum."
