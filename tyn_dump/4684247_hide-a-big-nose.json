Shine catches the eye and draws more attention to a feature, so shine on your nose will make your nose look even larger. The most important thing to do is to keep as much oil off your nose as possible. Use a gentle facial cleanser on your nose each morning and evening. Harsh cleansers can actually irritate the skin and cause it to produce more oil. Throughout the day, dab off some of the excess oil that gathers on your nose with tissue or cosmetic oil blotting paper. Make sure to use a toner and moisturizer after cleansing your face. When applying any makeup to your nose, use a matte formula instead of a shimmery formula. Use a primer before foundation so that oil does not disturb your foundation."

        "A center part will fall out directly above your nose, extending the straight line of your nose and drawing more attention to that particular feature.",
        "In contrast, a side part offsets the lines of your face, breaking them up and making your nose stand out less.",
        "Play with bangs.",
        "Bangs can help hide a large nose, but you should generally avoid bangs that hang down at blunt, sharp angles.",
        "Straight lines will only draw more attention to the straight line of your nose.",
        "When getting bangs, consider side swept bangs that break up the angles of your face or wispy bangs that that soften the lines of your face.",
        "Keep the hair off your face.",
        "While bangs can work, keeping hair off the face altogether may actually help more, especially if you don't like the way bangs look with your face shape.",
        "The idea here is to balance out your facial features with one another.",
        "When hair covers your forehead or the sides of your face, these features get lost while your nose remains very visible.",
        "As a result, your nose appears to take up more space on your face.",
        "Keeping hair off your face can prevent this from happening.",
        "That said, men who want to hide a big nose might find that a beard or mustache can help balance out their features.",
        "Part Four: Accessories Choose glasses with a wide, low bridge.",
        "The low sitting bridge will divide the long vertical line of your nose more evenly, so the bottom portion of your nose--the portion that the eye naturally catches--will seem smaller.",
        "A wide bridge creates a stronger, more visible divide.",
        "Larger frames are generally a better option than smaller ones.",
        "The large frames can compete with the size of your nose and help balance it out, but smaller frames can draw more attention to the size of your nose.",
        "The other option is to go for contacts.",
        "Since glasses sit at the top of your nose, they do draw some attention to that area of your face.",
        "Getting contacts avoids this issue completely.",
        "Wear large earrings.",
        "Your ears and nose share the same horizontal space on your face.",
        "Short, dainty earrings can draw attention to this horizontal space, which could also draw attention to your nose.",
        "Larger earrings that extend below the ear enlarge the sides of this horizontal space, making the nose at the center of this space appear smaller by comparison.",
        "If you do not want to wear long earrings, at least choose short earrings that cover the earlobes completely.",
        "This will draw more attention to the sides of this horizontal space, which can help draw attention off your nose.",
        "Rounded earrings that occupy both horizontal and vertical space are better than earrings that only add a vertical dimension.",
        "Earrings that emphasize straight, vertical lines will also emphasize the straight, vertical line of the nose.",
        "Pick a hat with a prominent brim.",
        "Both men and women should look for hat styles that have a rounded or down-turned brim at the front of the face.",
        "A brim that hangs down over the front of the face can visually build out the forehead.",
        "As a result, the nose appears shorter and more proportionate.",
        "Avoid \"tricorne\" styles, which meet at a point above the forehead.",
        "Hats that have a larger brim in the front than in the back may build out the forehead better than those with an even brim all around.",
        "Make sure that the crown does not pinch in too tightly toward the front of the face.",
        "Ideally, this crown should also be of medium height to maintain better visual balance, and it should not taper in much toward the top.",
        "Consider choosing a hat with a wide, colorful band above the brim.",
        "This band can draw the eye up and away from the nose."
