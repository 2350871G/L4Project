Convertible bras have adjustable straps, allowing you to change the way the straps fit based on the cut of your shirt. Basic convertible bras can usually be changed into halter bras and strapless bras; more extravagant convertibles have even more options. Consider silicone adhesive bras for deep necklines, backless tops and strapless tops. Silicone adhesive bras have no back and no straps. They stick onto your skin and smooth out your silhouette.

There are no rules about matching the bra to your underwear\u2013\u2013nobody sees the \"match\" and it's totally up to you whether this matters or not. If it does matter, aim to buy the bra and underwear at the same time to ensure a good match. Ensuring the Bra Works Stick with thicker straps if you are well-endowed. Thicker shoulder straps provide better support, which is essential for women with especially large busts. If you have a smaller bust size, however, thinner straps may provide enough support. Give yourself added lift with a push-up bra. The right push-up bra can work beneath a wide variety of tops, ranging from ordinary t-shirts to fancier blouses. Look for one that creates a smooth, natural silhouette, though, or else you may end up looking disproportionate or obviously fake. Wear padding sparingly. A bra with light padding can look natural and give your bust a few added inches. Too much padding can look obvious, however and will not flatter your figure well. Choosing the Correct Size Use a soft cloth tape measure to measure the length around your torso, just beneath your breasts. The measuring tape should rest where your bra band rests. Keep the tape smooth and parallel to the floor. Add five inches (12.5cm) to this measurement, rounding up to the nearest even whole number. This number is your band size. Use your tape measure to measure around the widest part of your chest. Usually, the tape measure should cross over your nipples. Keep the tape measure parallel to the floor. Do not allow it to become slack but do not keep it too tight, either. This number is your bust size. Take the difference between your band size and your bust size to find your cup size. Add a cup size for every inch (2.5cm). For example, a difference of one inch (2.5cm) puts you in an A cup, a difference of two inches (5cm) puts you in a B cup, a difference of three inches (7.5cm) puts you in a C cup, a difference of four inches (10cm) puts you in a D cup, and a difference of five inches (12.5cm) puts you in a DD or E cup. If the difference is less than one inch (2.5cm), you should wear an AA cup. When trying on a bra, place your hands through the straps and bend over at the waist, so that your breasts fall into the cups. The cups should contain your breasts and the center of your nipple should fall in the fullest part of the cup. If your breasts brim over the cup in the middle or at the sides, the bra is too small. If the bra fabric is pinched together in places and not filled in by flesh, the bra is too large. Adjust both the hooks and strap size of the bra to achieve a comfortable fit when trying on a bra. Neither the band nor the straps should dig into your skin but both should fit snugly and lie flat. Check the bridge of the bra. This center piece of fabric should lay flat against the breastbone.",
