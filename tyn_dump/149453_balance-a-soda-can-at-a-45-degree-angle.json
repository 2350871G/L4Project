This amount isn\u2019t precise (not without a heaping helping of math), so you will have to adjust as necessary. Tilt the can at a 45 degree angle. You want to tip the soda so that it rests on the groove that encircles the bottom of the can. Take care, as the movement of the liquid will cause the balance of the can to teeter until the liquid comes to rest.

Balancing a Salt Shaker Find a salt shaker. A salt shaker similar to a standard one you would find at most restaurants will work. Make sure the shaker has some salt to spare, as this trick doesn\u2019t work without salt available. Salt shakers without a beveled edge may have a more difficult time performing this trick, as it is harder for the salt to wedge itself under the shaker and prop it aloft.

Shake just a small amount, roughly the size of a quarter, onto the table. Don't pour too much - you don't want to make a mess, and only a small amount is necessary. Press the bottom edge of the salt shaker into the salt pile. Press the shaker all the way into the salt, and occasionally let go to see if the shaker has balanced itself. Don\u2019t get discouraged if it doesn\u2019t work at first \u2013 this part is largely trial and error. There is no trick! This can work with sugar crystals as well. However, it is a more difficult to achieve balance, as sugar granules are more fine, despite having a similar shape. Blow away the remaining salt. Once the shaker is stable and in place, blow the remaining salt away. This will remove any trace of salt, except for the few granules that are holding the shaker in place. It will appear the salt shaker is standing askew on its own. Confound your friends with the power of science! This can work with a pepper shaker as well, though it cannot balance on pepper! Salt granules have a square shape, meaning they have flat sides that can easily prop the salt shaker into place. Balancing Utensils at the Table Gather up the materials. Grab several utensils that you are not particularly worried about. You will be pushing a fork and spoon together and balancing them on a glass, so they are bound to fall a few times, and possibly get dinged or bent, as you get the hang of the trick. In total, you will need the following:\nTwo forks. A toothpick. A glass of water. A wine cork. Matches. A spoon (optional). Push the two forks together. Push each fork\u2019s teeth into one another so that it is snugly interlocked. You want to be able to operate the two utensils as one \u201cunit.\u201d When you pick up the handle of one utensil, the other utensil should be lifted as well. You may use a spoon and fork rather than two forks if you desire. Note that this may bend the teeth of one of the forks. Find the center of mass of the utensils. Rest the middle of where the utensils meet on your finger. Move the utensils back and forth on your finger until you they are perfectly balanced, with no other help needed to stay perched on your finger. This is the center of mass. Insert a toothpick into the center of mass. Force the toothpick into the center of mass by wedging it into where the two forks\u2019 teeth meet. Use just enough force to move the toothpick into the forks without breaking apart their hold to one another. This might take a few tries! If your toothpick breaks apart or can\u2019t find a wedge, try taking the forks apart and putting them back together, a little less snug this time. Balance the forks and toothpick on the rim of a glass. Find the point on the body of the toothpick that will perfectly balance the forks on the rim. The forks will lay horizontally along the rim of the glass, encircling the top. A little trial and error is all that is needed. You can try starting with a longer tooth pick if that helps you achieve the balance needed. You can also balance utensils this way on surfaces other than glasses. Try salt or pepper shakers if they're available! Burn the edge of the toothpick. Use a match and light the end of the toothpick overhanging the glass on fire. The toothpick will slowly burn away. Continue to do so until only the portions of toothpick touching the rim and overhanging. Wipe away the burned portions of toothpick to complete the illusion.",
