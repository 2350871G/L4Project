        "Check for growth and accumulation in all four corners of each room.",
        "If your wallpaper is peeling at the ceiling juncture, check behind it for mold growth.",
        "Check air ducts and vents.",
        "Fluctuations between heating and air conditioning cause moisture buildup on cooling coils and in drain pans.",

        "Follow the kit's directions.",
        "Submit the sampling to a local lab.",
        "If you see mold in a visual inspection, a testing kit isn't necessary.",
        "These kits can be difficult to use, and their results can be unreliable.",
        "Use them only as a last resort if other options aren't available.",
        "Use a borescope.",
        "A borescope can be helpful for inspecting spaces between walls.",
        "Drill a small hole into a wall recently affected by water or moisture.",
        "Slowly insert the fiber optic cable end through the hole.",
        "Check the monitor for signs of mold.",
        "Continue to move slowly as you probe deeper into the area.",
        "Borescopes distort the size and color of mold on the monitor.",
        "If you find areas of discoloration inside the wall, contact a professional for a second opinion.",
        "You can also use a borescope to inspect air ducts, but there are drawbacks.",
        "The instrument only lets you see so far into a duct.",
        "If the duct makes a sudden 90-degree turn, you won't be able to see beyond that turn.",
        "Hire a professional mold inspector.",
        "They have instruments for mold detection that aren't available to the general public.",
        "Get estimates from several inspectors to make sure you get a fair deal.",
        "Contact former customers for reviews and possible complaints.",
        "Consult your state's contractor licensing board to ensure your potential inspector is licensed.",
        "Make sure the inspector works with a lab accredited by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).",
        "Treating the Affected Areas Protect yourself.",
        "Cover your mouth and nose with an N-95 respirator to avoid breathing in spores.",
        "Wear elbow-length rubber or latex gloves to protect your hands from mold and cleaning materials.",
        "Cover your eyes with goggles to protect them from airborne spores.",
        "Clean hard surfaces.",
        "Mix equal parts water and detergent or bleach.",
