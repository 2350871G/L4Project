Clearing away these materials will improve the site\u2019s exposure to air and sunlight, both of which have a natural drying effect on wet soil. It\u2019s especially important to do away with absorbent plant matter. Things like dead leaves, old mulch, and decaying plant stalks have a tendency to hold water, which will just keep your soil soggy. If you don\u2019t clear your work site first, there\u2019s also a risk that you could inadvertently work the debris down into the soil as you turn it, making the problem worse. You can enhance air circulation and access to sunlight even further by cutting back sources of deep shade, such as overgrown shrubs and high branches with thick foliage."

        "If you need to cover more ground, it may be worth it to invest in a manual or motorized rotary aeration machine.Tip: There are even tow-style aerators that you can hitch to the back of a lawn tractor or similar vehicle to turn large patches of soil with minimal time and effort.",
        "Break up the surface of the soil with your aeration tool.",
        "Start at one end of the site and work your way across to the opposite end.",
        "Then, turn and go back in the opposite direction, using the prongs of your tool to churn up a fresh patch of untouched soil.",
        "Continue in this way until you\u2019ve turned the entire area you want to dry.",
        "As you work, the prongs of your aerator will open up lots of little holes in the dirt, allowing more air and sunlight to get in.",
        "To use a step aerator, place the prongs against the ground at a 90-degree angle and place your full weight on the head of the tool with one foot to plunge it into the dirt.",
        "When using a rake or fork, thrust the prongs into the ground like a spear, then rock the long handle back and forth to loosen the soil.",
        "If you\u2019ve opted for a pair of aeration shoes, simply strap them to your feet and walk back and forth across your work site.",
        "With this method, you\u2019ll get a little exercise as an added bonus!",
        "Operating an aerator machine is usually as easy as pushing it across your work surface like a lawn mower, but be sure to consult the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that you\u2019re using the tool safely and effectively.",
        "Keep the aerated soil clear for the next few days.",
        "As soon as you\u2019re finished, collect any lingering debris that your aerator uncovered.",
        "Afterwards, make an effort to keep rocks, fallen branches, deteriorating plant matter and other materials picked up while the elements do their thing.",
        "As long as the weather stays dry, your soil should be workable within about a week\u2019s time.",
        "Removing large clumps of loosened dirt can give the soil more room to expand, which in turn will improve its ability to drain more completely.",
        "Adding Drying Amendments to Growing Soil Clear away any possible obstructions that might make it harder to work.",
        "Start by raking up scattered brush, leaves, old mulch, and any other dense or absorbent debris.",
        "These materials can block air and sunlight from entering the dirt below.",
        "As a result, your soil will stay untouched by natural drying processes and remain wet longer.",
        "Failing to remove unwanted debris could allow it to find its way into the soil once you add your desired amendments, leaving the soil more waterlogged than before.",
        "Let the dirt dry as much as possible overnight.",
        "After clearing your work site, leave it to sit undisturbed for around 8-12 hours.",
        "This will give the surrounding air and sunlight a little time to work their magic on the soil before you begin improving it.",
        "There\u2019s no need to wait until it\u2019s completely dry, as this would basically defeat the purpose\u2014just make sure any standing water present has begun to recede.",
        "Moisture adds considerable weight to soil, so you\u2019ll have a much easier time working your amendments into the dirt when it\u2019s partially dry.",
        "If time is of the essence, it\u2019s alright to begin amending your soil while it is still somewhat soggy.",
        "Just be aware that you\u2019ll need to use a lot more elbow grease.",
        "Spread 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of gravel over the surface of the soil.",
        "Pour one or more bags of fine pea gravel over your work site and use a shovel or rake to disperse it to an even thickness.",
        "Working a small amount of gravel into the soil will create some non-absorbent space between the individual particles, letting more air in and minimizing the amount of water that the soil retains.",
        "You\u2019ll find pea gravel in various sizes at any gardening store, or in the lawn and garden aisle of your local home improvement center.",
        "You also have the option of using sand rather than gravel, provided you\u2019re working with a non-clay soil type.",
        "Introducing sand to wet clay can cause it to harden like concrete.",
        "Apply a 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) layer of your organic amendment of choice.",
        "Shovel some well-balanced topsoil, compost, humus, or another type of nutrient-dense material directly on top of the gravel.",
        "Distribute the material evenly over your work site.",
        "You\u2019re now ready to begin mixing the two layers of amendments into the soil.",
        "When you add gravel or sand to dirt, you increase the amount of space occupied by non-nutritive components.",
        "Your organic amendments will offset this effect by boosting the overall nutrient content of the soil.",
        "It\u2019s okay to skip this step if you don\u2019t plan on growing anything in the dirt you\u2019re drying.Tip: A good rule of thumb when working with clay soils is to use roughly 1 cubic yard (0.8 cubic meters) of amendment material for every 100 square feet (9.3 m) of ground.",
        "You can get away with using a slightly lower ratio on naturally drier types of soil.",
        "Mix the amendments into the soil with a shovel, rake, or hoe.",
        "Use your implement to thoroughly churn the soil over the area you want to dry.",
        "As you do, your amendment materials will become incorporated into the wet soil.",
        "For best results, aim to work the amendments down to a depth of at least 8\u20139 inches (20\u201323 cm), and make sure there are no dense pockets or clusters left behind.",
        "Once you\u2019ve amended the wet soil, any water remaining in the upper reaches should drain away faster than usual.",
        "You\u2019ll likely have fewer problems with moisture retention for a few weeks or months afterwards.",
        "Speed-Treating Building Sites with Lime Pick up one or more bags of quicklime or hydrated lime.",
        "There are several varieties of agricultural lime, each with its own unique chemical makeup and practical application.",
        "For the purpose of drying out saturated soil, your best bet will be to use either quicklime or hydrated lime.",
        "Both of these products are available at most major gardening stores and home improvement centers.",
        "The supplement known as \u201cquicklime\u201d is actually calcium oxide, while hydrated lime is more accurately known as calcium hydroxide.",
        "Both products serve the same function, but quicklime is generally the speedier of the two products.",
        "Avoid using standard agricultural lime.",
        "This type of lime is simply pulverized limestone, so it won\u2019t be any more effective than drying amendments like gravel or sand.",
        "Pull on some gardening gloves before you get to work.",
        "Choose a pair of gloves that are made from a thick, durable, multi-layered material and are free of holes or excessive wear.",
        "Both quicklime and hydrated lime can cause severe chemical burns if they come into contact with bare skin..",
        "While you're at it, it\u2019s a good idea to strap on a facemask to avoid inhaling irritating dust.",
        "Long-sleeved work clothes are also highly recommended.",
        "Be careful not to touch the lime with any unprotected part of your body, especially if your skin is wet or damp.",
        "Spread a minimum of 2 inches (5.1 cm) of lime over the surface of the soil.",
        "You can either use a shovel to distribute the lime or apply it exactly where you need it by hand.",
        "If you\u2019re dealing with a large, open area, such as a cleared construction site, it may help to use a push spreader or pneumatic bulk truck.",
        "Cover each area you want to dry completely.",
        "Try to make sure that the lime is an even thickness over your entire work site.",
        "If necessary, you can pile on additional lime in spots with standing water or particularly muddy soil.",
        "Let the lime sit for 1-2 hours before continuing.",
        "During this time, the lime will begin to evaporate excess surface water.",
        "This gives it a major advantage over slower drying methods like aeration and amendment.. Use a shovel, rake, or hoe to work the lime into the soil.",
        "Chop, turn, and dig into the damp dirt to break it up and incorporate the particles of lime still sitting on top.",
        "Try to mix the lime to a depth of at least 6 inches (15 cm).",
        "The deeper you can get it, the faster and more thoroughly it will dry out your soil.",
        "It may be necessary to work the lime as deep as 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) below the surface of the dirt if your work site is completely saturated.",
        "You should be able to tell a significant difference in the moisture level of your soil within roughly an hour of treatment.Warning: Keep in mind that adding lime to your soil will raise its pH level, making it more alkaline.",
        "This could have a negative impact on growing conditions if you intend to use your work site for raising plants or edible crops.",
        "Compact the soil if you\u2019re going to be building on it.",
        "Go over the entire surface with a lawn roller or hand tamper, pressing down the treated dirt until it feels firm.",
        "In addition to making your work site more structurally stable, compaction will also help to hold the buried lime in place.",
        "Because of this, the soil should remain relatively dry, even after heavy rainfall.",
        "Walking back and forth over small patches of dirt will also have the same effect without the need to use any additional equipment.",
        "Compacting large expanses efficiently may require you to use an industrial rolling device, such as a sheep\u2019s foot or flat wheel roller."
