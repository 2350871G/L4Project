Do a little research on your plant first to determine how big your container should be.

                    "description": "When you clone plants, you put a piece of a plant into soil or rockwool so that it can take root and grow. Rockwool is more complicated and requires more preparation than soil. It\u2019s needs to be soaked overnight in water with a PH balance of 4.5, and it doesn\u2019t contain the same nutrients that natural soil does. You also need to take the time to cut a hole in the center of a rockwool block so that it\u2019s not too big and not too small for the plant you\u2019re cloning. Potting soil, seed starting mix, or well composted garden soil can all be used for your plant. Normal soil dug up from your garden may not be ideal."

                    "headline": "Decide whether or not you want to use a root hormone.",
                    "description": "Root hormones are used in the cloning process to encourage plant cell growth. Plants naturally contain hormones called auxins, which help plants determine whether or not they should develop more leaves versus more roots. When you purchase a root hormone in a bottle, you\u2019ll be using a synthetic auxin. When the auxin is applied, the plant will think it needs to grow more roots, and the cloning process begins. If you\u2019re an organic gardener, root hormones may not be your friend. Many root hormones contain fungicides and chemicals that might not be earth friendly. If you are concerned about the use of chemicals in your gardening, you may want to opt for natural alternatives, such as willow tea, cinnamon, or diluted apple cider vinegar. Plants like tomatoes are easily cloned because they produce a lot of natural auxin, but other plants may only put out roots from the original root ball at the tip of the stem \u2014 which may make it difficult to get the plant to root without a synthetic hormone. Do some research on your plant before making any decisions to see what\u2019s right for the situation. Never dip your plant matter into your container of hormone. Take out the amount of hormone you need and apply to the plant per the instructions included. This is to avoid contaminating your supply."
