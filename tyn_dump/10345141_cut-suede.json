Hold the suede in place, and move the rotary cutter across the surface, pressing down as you go. If it doesn't go all the way through, run the cutter back over it. Most suede is thin enough to use a rotary cutter. If your cutter still isn't going all the way through, try another technique, or switch out your blade for a sharper one. A rotary cutter is like a pizza cutter. It has a round blade that goes around in a circle. You can find one at fabric or leather stores."

You can then use them as decorative pieces on purses, pillows, or even a leather jacket."

However, you can designate a side that will be on the inside of your piece so you can mark a pattern. It can be difficult to get any marks out of it, so make sure you hide the marks in the finished product. You can use a ballpoint pen, a grease marker, or a leather marking pen. The leather marking pen may come out, but since most suede is not coated, it may not. You can even use a silver or black permanent marker. Suede should generally not be washed at home, so don't try to run it through the washing machine before using it, even if you've marked it up."

Set the mat up on a flat surface, and hold the suede down on top. Follow the geometric lines on the cutting mat to make intricate cuts, or to cut out evenly-sized pieces. A self-healing cutting mat is your best option, which actually closes up around the cut you made in the surface each time.

You can decide how you want the nap to go, but make sure you're cutting your pieces all the same way so they're consistent. If the nap is smooth when it's facing upward on a piece, the piece will be darker. If it's facing downward, it will look a little frosted."

Any scissors will do, but leather scissors or a heavy-duty pair of sewing scissors will work best. You can use round cuts to create curved shapes like swirls or circles to use for decorations.

Cutting Fringe Cut out a large piece of suede for the fringe. Start with the size of the piece you want for your fringe. Keep in mind that you will need a band at the top that's not fringe. Leave a little extra room at the bottom of the piece for trimming up the fringe at the end. Line up a steel square on the top of the suede. A steel square is a ruler that has a right angle in the middle. Use the top part of the square to create an even width at the top of the suede, which will form the band that holds the fringe in place. The other part of the square should be on top of the suede going down, so that you can use it to guide your cut. A thick band at the top will keep your fringe from coming apart. Measure each piece of fringe. Use the ruler at the top to move the square over 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) to measure your first piece of fringe. Press down on the square, and run a utility knife down the length of the suede, starting at the bottom edge of the square at the top.
