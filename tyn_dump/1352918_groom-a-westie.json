Keep in mind that you can always take your dog to a professional groomer or to your veterinarian for nail trimming. Brush your Westie\u2019s teeth every day. Periodontal disease is a common problem seen by veterinarians. Keeping your Westie\u2019s teeth and mouth cavity clean with daily tooth brushing and regular veterinarian visits can help keep diseases at bay and keep your dog\u2019s breath fresh. Use a pet toothbrush, gauze pad, or a finger cot to brush your dog\u2019s teeth. It\u2019s important to use a pet toothbrush, which is extra soft and contoured for the shape of your dog\u2019s mouth. Use a toothpaste specifically formulated for dogs. Never use human toothpaste or baking soda, which have chemicals that can harm your dog. You can get pet toothbrushes and toothpaste at a pet store or your vet\u2019s office. Brush slowly and make sure to give your Westie lots of praise and petting. Coat each of the teeth with the toothpaste, which has an ingredient that won\u2019t require much brushing on your part. Aim to brush for 30 seconds per side of your dog\u2019s mouth. Give your Westie a treat for successful brushing sessions. Signs of poor oral hygiene or periodontal disease include bad breath, sensitivity around the mouth, loss of appetite, bleeding or inflamed gums, and missing teeth.",
