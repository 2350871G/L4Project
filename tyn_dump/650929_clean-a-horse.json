                    "description": "Before you start to clean your horse, you need to make sure that your horse won\u2019t run away by tying it to a stable fence or post. If possible, groom your horse in a wash rack with crossties. Get your curry comb, stiff-bristled brush, mane and tail comb, and a finishing brush. Set them aside where your horse can\u2019t knock them over. A rubber curry comb is preferable because it will make it easier to navigate the contours of your horse\u2019s body. A plastic mane and tail comb is better than a metal one because it\u2019s less likely to rip out knotted strands of hair. A finishing brush with a curved handle will make it easier to brush your horse\u2019s body."

Run the flat side of the curry comb through 4 fingers on your dominant hand and put your thumb on the side to keep it even. Use soft, circular motions and cover each section of the horse\u2019s hair at least twice. Your horse will appreciate it you spend more time grooming its withers and hindquarters since these are areas horses naturally groom on each other.Tip: Most horses enjoy a good brushing, but they may be nervous at first. Petting your horse while you start is a good way to calm your horse down during the beginning stages of the brushing."

Instead, use the finishing brush or a soft-bristle brush to carefully and slowly brush your horses face, taking special care to avoid the nostrils, ears, eyes, and mouth. Brush in small, circular and flicking motions. Approach the horse's face slowly so as not to scare it and work from the bottom to the top of their face.
