                    "description": "If you notice that the inside of your eyelid or your eye socket starts to feel itchy, or if you notice that your eye is watering more than normal, it's probably time to clean your eye. However, the amount of time between cleanings varies widely from person to person, so talk to your ocularist about how often to clean your eye.Tip: Make a note in your calendar when you wash your eye. Then, make another note when the eye needs to be cleaned again. Use the time between cleanings to estimate how often you prefer to clean your eye. You might clean your prosthesis every day, or you might prefer to clean it monthly or every several months. You might even choose to clean only your eyelid area at home, allowing your ocularist to clean during your normal polishing appointments every few months. If you're wearing a conformer, which is a lens that holds the shape of your natural eye, your ocularist will likely instruct you to clean it twice a day."
