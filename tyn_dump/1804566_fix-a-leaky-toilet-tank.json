        "Remove the water from the tank by flushing the toilet once the water\u2019s been turned off.",
        "You can also use a cup or a shop vac to get the water out of the tank.",
        "Disconnect the water supply tube behind the tank.",
        "This is the tube immediately beneath the location of the fill valve underneath the tank.",
        "Use a wrench to turn this tube counterclockwise to disconnect it.",
        "Depending on your toilet model, the supply tube will either be a long, rigid pipe or a short tube connected to the water supply shutoff valve.",
        "Unscrew the locknut attached to the fill valve on the bottom of the tank.",
        "This is the nut located underneath the tank that holds the fill valve in place.",
        "Use a small wrench or pair of pliers to loosen and remove the locknut.",
        "The locknut is most likely located right next to the supply tube.",
        "Remove the old fill valve through the top of the tank.",
        "Take the lid off of the top of the tank, if you haven\u2019t already.",
        "Pull the old valve directly upwards in order to remove it from the tank.",
        "Be sure you\u2019ve removed all the water from the tank before you do this.",
        "If you remove the fill valve with water still in the bottom of the tank, that water will fall out of the hole where the fill valve used to be and end up on the bathroom floor.",
        "Place the new fill valve in the tank and install it per its instructions.",
        "Put the new fill valve in the spot where you just removed the old valve and screw the locknut onto the bottom of it.",
        "Be sure to attach the refill tube to the side of the fill valve and orient it over the overflow tube in the tank.",
        "Note that the instructions will also include guidelines for how high the fill valve\u2019s float will need to be.",
        "Reattach the water supply tube behind the tank and turn on the water.",
        "Once the water supply has been turned back on, flush the toilet to test the new fill valve.",
        "If it fills correctly and doesn\u2019t overflow, it\u2019s fixed.",
        "If you\u2019re still experiencing problems with water leakage, your toilet may have a more serious problem.",
        "Call a plumber to have them diagnose the problem and see if it can be repaired.",

        "You\u2019ll recognize the bolts by the rubber washers underneath them.",
        "Use an adjustable wrench and screwdriver to tighten these bolts.",
        "Use a flathead screwdriver to hold the bolts in place.",
        "Then, with the adjustable wrench, turn the bolts clockwise underneath the tank to tighten them.",
        "Tightening the bolts should prevent water from seeping out from underneath the tank.",
        "Refill the tank and check for leaks coming from the bolts.",
        "Turn the water supply back on to allow the tank to refill.",
        "Wait a few minutes, then look underneath the tank to see if it\u2019s still leaking.",
        "If there\u2019s no more leak, the gasket has been fixed.",
        "If there is still a leak, the washers underneath the bolts in the tank will need to be replaced."
