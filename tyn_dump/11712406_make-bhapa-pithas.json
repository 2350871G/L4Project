Take the rice and grind it down to a coarse powder once it's dry. Do this in either a grinder or a food processor. Sift the flour into a clean bowl so that there are no big clumps in the flour. As an alternative, you can use store bought rice flour. Take two cups of store bought rice flour and grind it in either a grinder or food processor to make sure it is a coarse powder.

Once you are ready to steam the pithas, place them in the bamboo steamer, place that over/in the pot. Add 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) of water to the pot if you see if starting to dry out.

There are three types of steamers described below:\nIf you're using a homemade steamer, fill half of a saucepan with water and tightly cover the top with two layers of aluminum so that any vapor cannot escape.

When you are ready to cook the pithas, open the rice cooker,  place a sifter or colander on top of the rice cooker, and place the pithas on top of the colander or sifter, allowing the steam to reach the pitha. Create the base. Take a small bowl, about the size of your palm or a little smaller, and pack your rice mixture in. You only want to pack it in until it is half full. Fill the pitha. After packing the base, you are ready to put in the filling. Taking about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of coconut flakes, place them into the center of the bowl, over your base (you can use less/more than 2 tablespoon based on your preference). Afterwards, add about 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of jaggery (grate it to make it like flakes) or date molasses (amount is based on personal preference). Then add another layer of coconut flakes. Top the pitha. After putting your fillings insider of the pita, add more rice mixture to the bowl in order to cover your filling completely and create a type of \u201cjaggery & coconut\u201d sandwich. You want to pack it tightly together so the filling stays put in the middle and the pitha will not fall apart when you take it out of the bowl. Cooking the Pitha Put the pitha in a cloth. Take your cheese or cotton cloths out of the bowl of water they were soaking in and wring them out so that they are damp, not soaking or wet. Spread the cloth over the small bowl with your pitha in it. Holding the corners of your cloth up, slowly flip the small bowl over so that the cloth is now at the bottom. Gently tap the bottom of the bowl until your bhapa pitha unmolds itself from the bowl and into the cloth. Cook the pitha. Take the damp cloth and wrap it so that it takes the shape of your bhapa pitha. You want to wrap it tightly enough that your pitha is secure, but not so tightly that the cloth will stick and get stuck to your bhapa pitha. Afterwards, take your cloth covered pitha and place it in your steamer (whichever one you may be using). You want to steam your bhapa pitha for about 5-8 minutes. Unwrap the pitha. After allowing the bhapa pitha to steam for 5-8 minutes, take it out (with the cloth still around the actual pitha) using a ladle or tongs. Using a spatula, very gently pry the bhapa pitha from the warm cloth and put the bhapa pitha on a plate.
