                    "description": "The three common oils used for waterproofing wood are linseed, walnut, and tung. Tung oil is typically found as a mix in most commercial products. Raw tung oil is often more expensive than other oils, so it is usually used on smaller wood projects. Walnut oil is the same product you\u2019ll find next to olive oil in the grocery store. Due to nut allergies, walnut oil cannot be used commercially. Linseed oil can be purchased at most DIY repair shops, but many of these products are sold as raw or boiled. Boiled linseed oil contains metal drying agents that are poisonous. You can still use this product on outdoor patio equipment, but you should not use it for anything involving food. Linseed oil can also be bought without metal drying agents. Seek out raw linseed oil if you want a safe coat on certain woods like your kitchen counter top."

For larger projects like a patio deck, consider using an exterior stain and deck sealant. Oil is good for smaller based wooden objects like a cutting board, table, counter top, or baseball bat. Make a list of surfaces you want to treat. This will help you know how much oil to purchase. A good thing about treating with oil is that the oil stays good for several years. Purchase the oil that best suits your treating needs. Purchase a large container of oil. It is better to have too much than too little."
