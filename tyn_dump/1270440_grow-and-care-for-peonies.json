                    "description": "Peonies are incredible plants, but they require deep root development before they can bloom. This means that fully-bloomed peonies will die if you plant them without giving the roots time to develop. Purchase peony roots in the fall so that you can plant them in 2-8 weeks before the first frost of the season. This will give the plants plenty of time to settle into the soil. Peonies actually need a cold winter to grow and bloom. If you plant them in the spring or summer before exposing them to a cold winter, they may never grow. Peonies don\u2019t do well when they\u2019re transplanted to new locations. Take particular care when selecting a location for your flowers so that you get it right the first time. If you live in a slightly warmer part of the world, get tree peonies. They only require 100-300 hours of cold weather a year to adequately grow. You can\u2019t grow peonies where you live if you don\u2019t regularly experience near-freezing temperatures in the winter."

Select a part of your garden that isn\u2019t covered or under shade to ensure that your plants have plenty of access to the sun. Peonies will tolerate a little shade, but putting them under a tree or awning is a surefire way to keep your flowers from blooming. Peonies typically need 6-8 hours of sun a day. You can grow peonies in a pot indoors, but peonies require a lot of sun and a lot room to grow. It is extremely difficult to keep peonies alive in an indoor pot and is not recommended. If you do want to plant peonies indoors, use a pot that is at least 1 ft (30 cm) deep and 1 ft (30 cm) wide for each plant. If you\u2019re keeping your flowers indoors, put them next to an east-facing window so that they have adequate exposure to sunlight throughout the day."

Select a location in your yard where there are no other nearby plants or obstructions. Ideally, there should be no other plant or tree within 3\u20134 ft (0.91\u20131.22 m) of each of your peonies. If you\u2019re planting peonies that have already begun to bloom or flower, plant them in the early spring to ensure that they fully bloom before winter comes. Don\u2019t stick the peonies in a totally isolated area, though. It\u2019s good to have some shrubs, trees, or buildings nearby to break up the wind and protect your flowers from strong gusts.Tip: Peonies can grow in clay or soil. They\u2019re pretty resilient when it comes to the material that they\u2019re growing in. It is much more important that your flowers aren\u2019t competing for resources with other plants in the area, so keep your flowers away from other foliage."

Once your plants start to wither, you need to trim them down to avoid starving the roots. Grab a set of garden shears a week before the first freeze of the winter season. Cut your flowers down until there are only 3 inches (7.6 cm) of stem remaining  near the soil. Mulch the soil and repeat the process to ensure that your flowers come back next year. You can prune your plant to remove dead bulbs if you\u2019d like, but peonies typically don\u2019t require much (if any) pruning. Trim your plants down to the base of the stem if they get ill. The biggest predators when it comes to peonies are blight, rot, and fungus. If you ever notice discolored fungus or dark rot setting into your plants, trim them down to the topsoil and discard the damaged portions of each plant. Wait for a year to allow the winter frost to kill any remnants of the disease. Peonies tend to be very resilient when it comes to insects and illness. If you ever have a year where your plants seem sickly, the winter will freeze away most of the common offenders and your plants will grow back beautifully next year. You may notice ants feeding on the flowers when they bloom. Don\u2019t worry about the ants, they can\u2019t permanently damage the plant and won\u2019t cause very much trouble\u2014they\u2019re only there for the secretions that come out of the flowers.",

        "Once you\u2019ve selected an area to plant your flowers, give each plant ample space to keep the roots from competing for resources.",
        "If you plant your peonies too close to one another, the roots will fight over water and nutrients, causing at least one of your plants to become underdeveloped.",
        "Giving each root system ample space in your yard or garden is the best way to ensure that your plants grow healthy and strong.",

        "You can use liquid or granular fertilizer.",
        "However, some gardeners prefer granular fertilizer for plants and flowers that you plant right before winter.",
        "If you\u2019re planting your peony in a pot, you can put a coffee filter at the base of the pot before filling it to ensure that the compost and fertilizer don\u2019t fall through the drainage holes immediately.",
        "Fill each hole halfway with neutral to slightly alkaline soil with a pH of 6-7.5.",

        "Cover each of your planting sites with a 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) layer of your preferred mulching material.",
        "While peonies certainly need cold weather to grow, you don\u2019t want the roots themselves to freeze too quickly or for too long.",
        "Mulching the soil insulates it and ensures that the soil won\u2019t freeze and thaw repeatedly through the season.",
        "Most peonies need around 400-hours of exposure of near-freezing temperatures in the winter to bloom completely in the summer.",
        "You do not need to mulch peonies that you\u2019re storing indoors.",
        "Indoor peonies do not require as many freezing hours, since their root systems won\u2019t get that big anyway.",

        "Get a fertilizer that is low in nitrogen from your local gardening store.",
        "As spring progresses, you\u2019ll soon notice stems sticking out of the ground.",
        "When the stems get to be around 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) high, sprinkle 2-3 tablespoons (15-20 g) of fertilizer into the soil and mix it with your top soil by hand or with a trowel.Tip: If you want to produce bigger flowers, clip the bud at the top of the stem as soon as you see it.",
        "Removing the top bud will reduce the weight at the top of the plant as it grows, causing the plant to grow wider instead of taller.",
        "You may not see any stems emerge from the soil for the first 1-2 years.",
        "Water your plants once every other week for the first 2 years.",
        "Over the course of the first 2 years, you may not notice much progress with your peonies.",

        "Apply a soft stream of water to the top soil for 5-6 seconds when you go to water the rest of your garden.",
        "You do not need to water your peonies in the winter.",

        "Once you notice your flowers growing, water them once every 3-4 weeks.",
        "Peonies are pretty easy to care for after the first few years, and it\u2019s particularly hard to starve them of water since their root systems are so efficient.",
        "Give them a few seconds of water by spraying around the stem of the plant once your peonies have grown.",
        "Peonies typically bloom around April or May.",
        "The blooms may only last a few weeks, but they\u2019ll be back next year!",
