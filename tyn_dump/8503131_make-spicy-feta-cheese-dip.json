Set them under a preheated broiler, and allow them to roast for 10 to 15 until they become charred on the outside. Turn the peppers every 5 minutes to ensure that they\u2019re roasted evenly on all sides. You can adjust the number of peppers to suit your tastes. If you don\u2019t want your dip to be very spicy, stick to 1 pepper. If you prefer a spicier dip, use 2. You can substitute any hot peppers that you like for the banana peppers. Jalapenos are a good option. When you\u2019re broiling the peppers, set the rack in the upper third of the oven so there is approximately 8- to 9-inches (20- to 23-cm) between the peppers and the broiling element."
