The small jar functions as a way to take up space in the middle so that the ant colony will build tunnels and lay eggs close to the outer edge, putting these processes in plain view. Skipping this step will allow the ants to burrow deep toward the middle of the jar, which they'll naturally want to do. Different-sized canning jars are perfect for this project. But, if you want your ants to be happy, then buy a larger container. Look for jars without etching, print or raised numbers and letters. Plain, clear glass will give you the best view of the ants. If you'd prefer to have a flat ant farm, check out your local pet store and purchase a skinny aquarium. You can also order an ant farm setup from online retailers."

If you're planning to source the ants from your yard or a nearby area, your best bet is to use dirt they already naturally live in. Dig up enough dirt to fill up the extra space in your jar. Use a fork or your fingers to loosen the dirt until it's nice and fine. Now mix 2 parts dirt with 1 part sand - less if your dirt is already naturally quite sandy. If you aren't planning on getting your ants from a nearby location and the dirt you have on hand doesn't seem suitable, you can buy potting soil and sand from a gardening store and mix it to serve as your substrate. If you order an ant farm kit, it should come with the right mixture for those particular ants. You want the mix to be slightly moist, but not soaking wet. If it's too dry, the ants will dry out; if it's too wet, they'll drown."

If you see a group of ants walking, follow them back to their nest. Observe the anthill to make sure you aren't dealing with fire ants or another type of ant that bites or stings badly. Brown field ants are a good bet. If you want to be on the safe side, order your ants online as part of an ant farm kit."

Here are a few things to keep in mind:\nThe ants probably won't reproduce unless you include a queen in your ant farm. An ant colony's queen lays all the eggs, and a group of worker ants - those you're likely to see close to the surface of an anthill - are likely to be sterile. Therefore, if you want to see ants go through the process of laying eggs, you'll need to get a queen - which can be tricky and would require destroying the natural ant colony. If you're set on seeing the reproductive cycle, a better bet may be to order a kit that comes with a queen ant. That way, you won't have to worry about digging deep into the ant's nest to get what you need. Another method is to catch a queen during its nuptial flight and raise a colony from just a queen. If you create a farm without a queen, the ants will probably die within 3 - 4 weeks, which is their natural lifespan."
