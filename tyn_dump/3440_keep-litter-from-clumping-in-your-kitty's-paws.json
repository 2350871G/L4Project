                    "description": "Although it\u2019s impossible to stop litter sticking to your cat\u2019s paws entirely, non-clumping litter does tend to stick less than clumping litter. This is because clumping litter has granules that are designed to clump together and to stick to everything including waste, surfaces, and your cat's fur. Choose low-dust, non-clumping litter if possible. The dustiness of regular litter means that it tends to stick more easily. Dust from the litter can also be an irritant for both you and your cat. Non-clumping litter is especially important for long-haired cats. This is because it is less likely to get stuck in their long fur and irritate their skin."
