                    "description": "Choose a chef\u2019s knife that feels heavy in your hand and has a serrated edge so you can easily cut through the meat. Make sure the knife is sharp so it doesn\u2019t leave a jagged edge when you make your cut. If you don\u2019t have a knife in your kitchen that will work, visit a kitchen specialty store and ask the employees for a knife that cuts through frozen meat. Using a standard knife works best for thin cuts of boneless meat, such as chicken breasts, sausages, or tenderloins. Alternatively, you can also chop the frozen meat with a butcher\u2019s cleaver, but it can be more dangerous if the blade slips."
