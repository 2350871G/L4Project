        "Use a wrench to unscrew these pins and loosen them.",
        "You don\u2019t need to remove the completely, but you do need to be able to get underneath them to reach all of the pin.",
        "If there aren\u2019t any washers or bolts, simply skip this step.",
        "Washers in this part of the fan assembly can usually be turned by hand.",
        "Apply lubricating oil to the front and back of the pin.",
        "Get a bottle of lubricating oil with a thin nozzle for pouring.",
        "Get a clean rag and hold it under the pin to catch any oil that drips.",
        "Turn your bottle over at the site where the pin meets the frame of the motor and squeeze the bottle over the front of the pin.",
        "Get underneath the bolts by sliding them away from the site that you\u2019re lubricating.",
        "Repeat this process on the backside of the frame to get both sides of the pin.Warning: Use enough oil to completely coat the pin.",
        "You don\u2019t want to get any oil on the motor itself though.",
        "If you see it dripping off of the pin, tap it with the cloth to soak up the excess oil.",
        "Any type of lubricating oil will work.",
        "You can buy lubricating oil at any auto parts shop or building supply store.",
        "You can wear rubber gloves if you want to keep oil from getting on your hands.",
        "It\u2019s not toxic or anything though, and are easily wiped off before washing your hands with soap.",
        "Spin the bolts around a lubricated section of the pin while spinning it.",
        "With your pin totally oiled, slide the bolt back into place.",
        "Put the cloth down and hold the bolt with your nondominant hand.",
        "Grab the pin with your dominant hand.",
        "Slide the bolt back and forth over the lubricated section while spinning the pin by hand.",
        "Repeat the process for any bolts on the other side of the pin assembly.",
        "This will ensure that oil gets on the inside of the bolts that hold your pin while it spins.",
        "If these bolts aren\u2019t oiled, there will be friction that prevents the pin from spinning.",
        "You can also slide the bolts off and oil them separately if you want.",
        "Cleaning the Motor and Vent Inspect the back of your motor case for dust or grime and wipe it off.",
        "Turn the fan around and look inside the case surrounding the motor.",
        "Use a clean microfiber cloth to carefully wipe the dust away.",
        "Work your way all the way around the interior of the case to remove the dust and grime that has built up in the back of your fan.Warning: Do not use water to clean the area around your motor.",
        "If water gets on the motor, it could cause an electrical short or destroy your fan.",
        "Poor ventilation can cause dust and heat to get trapped inside the case of the motor.",
        "This can cause your fan to stop functioning\u2014especially if your fan has an overheating feature that causes it to automatically shut off if it gets too hot.",
        "Spray the plastic vent on the back with compressed air.",
        "Take the vent cover that you unscrewed before you lubricated your fan and hold it away from your motor.",
        "Spray both sides of the cover with compressed air to get the dust out of the hard-to-reach spaces between the vent\u2019s bars.",
        "Wipe the cover down with a dry cloth.",
        "If this vent is completely caked in dust or debris, it\u2019s probably the reason that your fan hasn\u2019t been functioning correctly.",
        "If you want to get it totally clean, you can soak the vent in water and soap before letting it air dry.",
        "This is usually unnecessary though.",
        "Plug your fan in and turn it on to see if the pin spins.",
        "Before reassembling your fan, plug it back in.",
        "Turn it on to see if the pin spins easily.",
        "If it does, you can reassemble the fan.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t, you may need to clean the motor.",
        "This can be a difficult and intricate process though, and if you\u2019re working with an inexpensive fan, it\u2019s usually not worth the effort.",
        "A lot of standing and table fans don\u2019t have a removable motor in the first place, which makes cleaning or adjusting it extremely difficult.",
        "Reassemble your fan by putting the blades, bolts, and case back together.",
        "Work in the reverse order that you disassembled your fan.",
        "Tighten the bolts on your pin with a wrench and put any washers back before sliding the blade guard back over the pin.",
        "Slide your blades on top so that the back blade guard separates the blades from the motor.",
        "Put the plastic vent back on the back of the motor case and screw it back in.",
        "Reattach your front blade guard and lock it in place.",
        "Turn your fan back on.",
        "If the blades are spinning more slowly than the pin was when you tested it, it\u2019s a sign that your motor is dying.",
        "It\u2019s operating at a power too low to completely turn the fan."
