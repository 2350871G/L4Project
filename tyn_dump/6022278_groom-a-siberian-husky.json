Brush lightly, and don\u2019t pull or tug at the hair. Avoid grooming in one spot for too long. Move around your dog\u2019s body and work on different spots.

By nature, Siberians are very clean dogs and will clean themselves on a daily basis. They also shed their entire undercoat least once a year, called \u201cblowing the coat.\u201d This process can last up to six weeks from start to finish. Your job, as an owner, is to clean up after your Husky\u2019s shedding and brush out her coat to encourage shedding and strong hair re-growth. Though your Husky may appear hot during the summer in her thick coat, never shave or over groom them. Her coat is designed to keep her cool in the summer. Her undercoat insulates her and her top coat provides protection from harmful UV rays, so it should never be cut short. Use a shedding brush once a week on your dog\u2019s coat. These consist of a hoop made of metal attached to a plastic handle. It\u2019s a must have tool to upkeep your Husky\u2019s coat and make sure it looks its best. With swift, light side to side motions, run the shedding brush over your Husky\u2019s coat. It helps to have a second person close by with a vacuum as you groom your Husky with the shedding brush. This will prevent hair from flying all over the place and keep hair off your furniture and your carpet.",
