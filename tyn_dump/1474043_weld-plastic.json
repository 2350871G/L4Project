Eliminate dirt, grease, and other debris the plastic picked up over time since it could weaken the weld. Then, dry the plastic off with a clean, lint-free cloth when you\u2019re done. For stubborn stains, try using a liquid solvent called methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), which you can get online or at a hardware store. Moisten a clean rag with the solvent, then scrub the plastic until the stain comes out. Avoid using any industrial-strength detergents. They often leave behind a soapy film that affects the weld."

Choose a rod that matches the type of plastic you plan on welding. For example, you would need a polyethylene rod to join pieces of polyethylene together. You can often fix a crack on a single piece by melting plastic around it, but have a welding rod on hand to cover any gaps."

Heat the end of the rod like you normally would in welding to attach it to a clean spot on the plastic. Then, try pulling the rod off the plastic using a pair of pliers. If it stays attached, then it is the same material as the plastic. Since you can only combine the same type of plastic, only a single rod will stay welded to the plastic. Refer to the letter marking or the test kit manual to determine what type of plastic that rod is. Testing kits, along with welding rods and other materials, are available online or at many hardware stores."

The temperature you need will be somewhere between 200 and 300 \u00b0C (392 and 572 \u00b0F). Anything beyond that range either burns the plastic or doesn\u2019t melt it enough. For example, set the welding gun to 300 \u00b0C (572 \u00b0F) when working on propylene and polyurethane. Adjust the heat setting to about 275 \u00b0C (527 \u00b0F) to work on PVC. Set the heat to about 265 \u00b0C (509 \u00b0F) for polyethylene."

Fit a tack welding nozzle on your welding gun, then apply a little bit of heat. Wait for the plastic to begin melting, joining the pieces of plastic together. This will keep the plastic from moving as you complete the weld. A tack welding nozzle looks like a tube with a fin on the end. Press the fin against the plastic to heat it and melt it together. All you need to do is melt the plastic a little to ensure it can\u2019t come apart. If you need to, tack weld spots every 1 ft (0.30 m) along the joint for additional security."

If you don\u2019t have pliers, use a trimming knife to scrape the rod to a point. By giving the rod a pointed end, you increase the chances of getting a smooth, steady weld without a big bubble of plastic where you start. You can let the welding gun cool off before changing nozzles and inserting the welding rod. However, remember to let the gun heat up again before starting the weld."

After fitting the nozzle on your plastic welding heat gun, feed the rod into the second opening on top. Put the clipped end in first so you can use it when starting the weld. Make sure you don\u2019t touch the tack nozzle if it is still hot. Either wait for the nozzle to cool or swap the nozzles carefully with a pair of pliers. With a speed nozzle, you will need to feed the rod into the opening while you weld. You could also hold the rod horizontally over the joint and melt it with a technique called pendulum welding, where you sweep the gun or torch back and forth. It takes a little longer but is great for tight spots."

Then, heat the plastic until you see it beginning to melt. As you push the welding torch along the joint, feed the welding rod into it with your free hand. The key to success with welding is consistency. If you move as a deliberate pace, you can melt the plastic and welding rod just enough to bind them without burning them. If you notice the plastic burning or changing colors, move the torch at a faster pace. Don\u2019t let it linger on the plastic or else you will end up applying too much heat."

Then, position the welding rod at a 45-degree angle from the opposite side. As you hold the rod in place, sweep the nozzle back and forth 3 or 4 times to melt it. Keep doing this as you move down the plastic to complete the weld. Pendulum welding is useful if you don\u2019t have a plastic heating gun with a speed nozzle. You can do it with a basic propane torch. This is also an effective way to fill a tight joint you can\u2019t easily reach with a speed nozzle. This part is a little trickier than with speed welds since you have to control both the torch and the welding rod at the same time. Move the torch constantly to prevent the plastic from burning. Swing it back and forth across the joint at a consistent pace to lightly heat and melt the plastic."

        "Joining the Plastic Preheat the welding gun for at least 2 minutes.",
        "Every type of plastic melts at a different temperature, so setting your welding gun up correctly is important.",
        "The temperature you need will be somewhere between 200 and 300 \u00b0C (392 and 572 \u00b0F).",
        "Anything beyond that range either burns the plastic or doesn\u2019t melt it enough.",
        "For example, set the welding gun to 300 \u00b0C (572 \u00b0F) when working on propylene and polyurethane.",
        "Adjust the heat setting to about 275 \u00b0C (527 \u00b0F) to work on PVC.",
        "Set the heat to about 265 \u00b0C (509 \u00b0F) for polyethylene.",
        "Secure the plastic together by tack welding the ends.",
        "Before you start the actual weld, pin loose pieces of plastic together by melting the ends of the joint.",
        "Fit a tack welding nozzle on your welding gun, then apply a little bit of heat.",
        "Wait for the plastic to begin melting, joining the pieces of plastic together.",
        "This will keep the plastic from moving as you complete the weld.",
        "A tack welding nozzle looks like a tube with a fin on the end.",
        "Press the fin against the plastic to heat it and melt it together.",
        "All you need to do is melt the plastic a little to ensure it can\u2019t come apart.",
        "If you need to, tack weld spots every 1 ft (0.30 m) along the joint for additional security.",
        "Trim the end of a welding rod with angle cutting pliers.",
        "Trimming a rod is very simple.",
        "Hold the pliers diagonally toward the end of the rod.",
        "Then, snip it to hone the rod to a point.",
        "If you don\u2019t have pliers, use a trimming knife to scrape the rod to a point.",
        "By giving the rod a pointed end, you increase the chances of getting a smooth, steady weld without a big bubble of plastic where you start.",
        "You can let the welding gun cool off before changing nozzles and inserting the welding rod.",
        "However, remember to let the gun heat up again before starting the weld.",
        "Insert a welding rod into a speed nozzle on a welding gun.",
        "A speed nozzle has an opening to hold the welding rod as you melt it onto the joint.",
        "If one didn\u2019t come with your heat gun, you can buy one separately.",
        "After fitting the nozzle on your plastic welding heat gun, feed the rod into the second opening on top.",
        "Put the clipped end in first so you can use it when starting the weld.",
        "Make sure you don\u2019t touch the tack nozzle if it is still hot.",
        "Either wait for the nozzle to cool or swap the nozzles carefully with a pair of pliers.",
        "With a speed nozzle, you will need to feed the rod into the opening while you weld.",
        "You could also hold the rod horizontally over the joint and melt it with a technique called pendulum welding, where you sweep the gun or torch back and forth.",
        "It takes a little longer but is great for tight spots.",
        "Move the tip of the welding gun slowly over the plastic for a speed weld.",
        "Start at the top of the crack or area you wish to join.",
        "Hold the gun downward at about a 45-degree angle, touching the edge of the nozzle to the plastic.",
        "Then, heat the plastic until you see it beginning to melt.",
        "As you push the welding torch along the joint, feed the welding rod into it with your free hand.",
        "The key to success with welding is consistency.",
        "If you move as a deliberate pace, you can melt the plastic and welding rod just enough to bind them without burning them.",
        "If you notice the plastic burning or changing colors, move the torch at a faster pace.",
        "Don\u2019t let it linger on the plastic or else you will end up applying too much heat.",
        "Swing the welding gun back and forth if you\u2019re doing a pendulum weld.",
        "Hold the nozzle about 2.54 cm (1.00 in) above the crack, tilting the gun at a 45-degree angle.",
        "Then, position the welding rod at a 45-degree angle from the opposite side.",
        "As you hold the rod in place, sweep the nozzle back and forth 3 or 4 times to melt it.",
        "Keep doing this as you move down the plastic to complete the weld.",
        "Pendulum welding is useful if you don\u2019t have a plastic heating gun with a speed nozzle.",
        "You can do it with a basic propane torch.",
        "This is also an effective way to fill a tight joint you can\u2019t easily reach with a speed nozzle.",
        "This part is a little trickier than with speed welds since you have to control both the torch and the welding rod at the same time.",
        "Move the torch constantly to prevent the plastic from burning.",
        "Swing it back and forth across the joint at a consistent pace to lightly heat and melt the plastic.",
        "Finishing the Weld Wait at least 5 minutes for the plastic to cool.",
        "Let the plastic come back to room temperature before you continue working on it.",
        "Welded plastic doesn\u2019t take long to cool down, but you can wait as long as you please.",
        "Look for the welded plastic to turn solid.",
        "If you don\u2019t feel any heat coming off of it, you are ready to work on it.",
        "The best time to fix a weld is before it cools.",
        "A good weld looks relatively smooth and consistent.",
        "Add more of the welding rod or smooth out the melted plastic with your gun as needed.",
        "Set your welding gun aside when you\u2019re done.",
        "Remember to put it in a safe spot, such as in a heat-resistant holster, until it cools.",
        "Sand the welded joint down with 120-grit sandpaper.",
        "Smooth out the rough ridges on the weld to make it look consistent with the rest of the plastic.",
        "Apply light pressure to the weld, rubbing the sandpaper back and forth across it.",
        "Try to get the weld to look level with the area around it, but be careful to avoid scratching the plastic around it.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for a speedier way to do this, use a sanding wheel on a rotary tool.",
        "Be careful, though, since plastic is relatively soft and easy to scratch.",
        "Finish the plastic with 180 and 320-grit sandpaper.",
        "Switch to finer grits of sandpaper to neaten out the weld.",
        "Higher-grit sandpaper is finer and less abrasive, but it can still scratch the plastic if you\u2019re not careful.",
        "Rub the weld down like you did with the 120-grit sandpaper until it looks consistent and feels smooth to the touch.",
        "Always start with the lower-grit sandpaper.",
        "It is coarser, so it wears away more of the plastic.",
        "Save the higher-grit sandpaper for finishing."
