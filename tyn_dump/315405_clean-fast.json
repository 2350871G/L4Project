If you're having company over, you may want to focus your cleaning efforts on the living room and bathrooms. Or if you're having guests over for dinner, ensure that the kitchen and dining room are clean. It's also important to decide which areas aren't priorities. For example, close off the bedroom doors if people won't be going in them and you're short on time."

                    "description": "Ask yourself if you want to spend the day cleaning your place or if you only have an hour or 2. Identify how much time you have to put towards cleaning and consider using a timer to keep you on task. For example, if you're having company come over and you only have 1 hour to clean, set a timer for 15 minutes. Clean your living room in this time and set a timer for 30 minutes to clean the rest of your house. Give yourself another 15 minutes for dishes and floors."

Turn the volume up so you can hear it over the sounds of a vacuum or if you're at the end of your home. Music can make clean up fun and less of a chore.

If your roommate can't help, ask them what you want them to do with their things. They may not want you sorting through their clothes or clutter.
