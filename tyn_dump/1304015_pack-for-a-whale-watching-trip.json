Simple cotton or cotton-blend gloves should usually be fine if the cold is not severe. But you may want to bring wool gloves or gloves lined with insulation if you anticipate particularly cold temperatures. If you're planning on using your phone or other devices, you may want to bring gloves that you can wear while using touchscreens."

To keep yourself warm and dry, wear a waterproof jacket with a hood. If it's going to be particularly cold, make sure it's a heavy jacket or even a winter coat.
