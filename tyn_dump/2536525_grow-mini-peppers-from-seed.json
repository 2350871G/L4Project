Thus, if you choose to get seeds from a pepper, you should take seeds from the kind of pepper you\u2019d like to reproduce. Choose one that is fresh, healthy, and from a hardy plant. You can also buy mini pepper seeds online or at your local gardening store. Some store-bought mini peppers will be able to reproduce. However, some commercial produce is actually sterile and the seeds will not grow into fruit-bearing plants."

Once the seeds have been removed from the pepper, inspect them and remove any that are discolored or damaged. If the mini peppers you\u2019re growing are hot, be careful. The seeds contain capsaicin, which is the chemical that gives peppers their heat. It can burn your skin, depending on how hot the pepper is.

You can place your seeds in starter pots as early as 12 weeks before the final frost date. Seeds can be started in any small container with good drainage. Gardening supply stores sell starter pots in multi-packs. However, you can also use paper or plastic cups and poke holes through the bottom for draining extra water. Fill each cup or starter pot with potting soil or topsoil. Then, place the seeds in the soil, about \u00bd\u201d below the surface. You can plant anywhere between one and three seeds per container, depending on the size of the pot. Plant more seeds than the number of plants you hope to produce.

A good gauge of when to water is to wait until your seedlings begin to wilt slightly. That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to water.

        "Extremely hot peppers should be picked with caution or with gloves, so you don\u2019t get burned.",
        "Extend your season by trimming your plants.",
        "About six weeks before you expect your first frost, cut back the tp branches and flowers of your plants.",
        "This causes the peppers that are already growing to mature more quickly, so they can ripen before the frost."
