This will allow the iPod to use your current location for apps requiring that information, as well as for geotagging photos and videos. Choosing to enable or disable the functionality is your choice. Connect to a Wi-Fi network. You may need to enter a password. Choose how to set up the iPod. You can set it up as a brand new device, or sync your apps, music, photos, and other information from a previous iTunes or iCloud backup. If you select \"Restore from iCloud Backup\" or \"Restore from iTunes Backup\", your iPod should begin to sync the information. This article assumes you are setting up the device as new. Sign in with your Apple ID. If you don't have one, select \"Create a Free Apple ID\". Determine if you want to use iCloud. Launched in October 2011, iCloud allows users to wirelessly sync any downloaded apps, books, photos or videos to all their Apple devices. It's a free service, but purchasing more storage space \"in the cloud\" requires a fee. Again, choosing to use the service or not is up to you. If you'd like to use it, select \"Use iCloud\". Choose between backing up the iPod to iCloud or to your computer. Backing up to iCloud is wireless but uses your free \"cloud\" storage allotment; backing up to your computer requires connecting the device to a Mac or PC via USB cable (but is free). Decide if you want to use Find My iPod. If your iPod is stolen or you happen to lose it somewhere, the Find My iPod feature can help locate it, remotely set a passcode, wipe all of its data, and more. Using the service is optional as well. Select between sending diagnostic data to Apple automatically, or not at all. If your iPod crashes, it will send a report of the crash to Apple for analysis. If you'd rather not have your device do this, tap \"Don't Send\". Tap \"Register with Apple\" to officially activate the device. Select \"Start Using iPod\". You're good to go!"

The arrows are to move backward or forward to pages you've already visited. The left-pointing arrow is back; the right-pointing arrow is forward. The arrow coming out of the square opens an options menu. From here, you can add bookmarks, mail links, tweet, or print. The open book provides access to your bookmarks. Bookmark your favorite pages using the options menu. The layered squares on the far right allow you to open multiple windows. If you want to look up another site without losing the page you already have open, tap this button and hit New Page in the lower left corner. You can scroll between pages by swiping your finger left or right. Close unwanted pages by tapping the red X in the upper left corner. Tap Done when you are finished. Other Apps Know what an app is.

These include Music + iTunes, Safari, Mail, GameCenter, Photos, iMessage, and more. There will be four apps \"docked\" at the bottom of the screen; these are usually the most-used apps, such as Music or Safari. You can purchase media directly from your iPod using the iTunes app. You can purchase apps from the App Store. Several popular apps are available for free. Know the status of an app, and whether or not it needs WiFi to be used or not. Some apps will require access to the Internet via WiFi. To manually select a Wi-Fi network or hotspot, click the Settings icon, then select WiFi to see a list. This only works where there is a trusted wireless network; the iPod won't connect to untrusted networks. Settings is also where you can adjust screen brightness, wallpaper, security, and app settings. Know how to text/send a message to your other iPod touch/iPhone/iPad/iDevice friends/contacts with iMessage. iMessage allows you to send free instant messages other iPods, iPads or iPhones using a Wi-Fi connection.
