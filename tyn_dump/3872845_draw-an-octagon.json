Draw a straight vertical line (also splitting the circle to equal parts) of which its center will intersect with that of the horizontal line.  Draw a straight diagonal line (northwest to southeast) that will also intersect at the center, dividing equally the space between the horizontal and vertical lines.  Draw another diagonal line (northeast to southwest) that will also intersect at the center, dividing equally the space between the horizontal and vertical lines.

Erase the lines inside the octagon.  You now have a regular octagon! Color the drawing as desired. Multiple Octagon Draw a square at the center of the page.  Draw straight lines that will connect one corner to its direct opposite corner.  Note the length between the center point (where the lines intersects) towards one of the square's corners. On each of the square's corners, use this length as the radius as you draw a circle, using the square's corner as the circle's center. You will end up with a flower-like image.
