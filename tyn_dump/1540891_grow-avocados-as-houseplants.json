Wash the seed thoroughly to remove any remaining pulp.  Utilize the Paper Towel Method Prepare the seed for germination. Slice a thin piece of the top and bottom of the seed using a sharp knife. Opening the seed slightly will aid in its germination. Wrap the seed in a damp paper towel.  Place the seed in a covered dish. Place the dish in a dark area, such as a closet, for 2 to 3 weeks. Check your seed for germination. Observe the seed periodically for root growth. When the roots are 3 inches (7.62 cm) in length, the seed is ready to plant. Utilize the Toothpick Method Insert 4 toothpicks in either side of the avocado seed, about halfway between the bottom and top.  Place the seed in a glass of water. Face the pointed end of the seed upward and balance it with the toothpicks on the sides of the glass, making sure 1/4 of the bottom of the seed is resting in water. Place the water glass on a windowsill, but out of direct sunlight.  Refill the water periodically. Check the water level and refill when the level goes below 1/4 of the bottom half of the seed. Observe the seed. In about 2 to 4 weeks, the seed should crack and a root should appear, followed by a stem. When the root is about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 cm) long, it will be ready for potting. Plant the Seed Prepare the pot. Line a small planting pot with drainage holes with a small amount of gravel. Fill the rest of the pot with potting soil. Place the seed, roots down, into the soil. Leave the top sprouts of the root system exposed, as well as 1/3 of the upper part of the seed. Pat the dirt firmly around the seed and water. Care for the Plant Place your pot in a room where the temperature remains between 60 to 80 degrees F (16 to 27 degrees C).  Provide your houseplant with water as often as needed to maintain moist soil, but make sure it is not overly wet. ",
