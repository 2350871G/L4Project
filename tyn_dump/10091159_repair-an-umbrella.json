You'll have a smoother time fixing your umbrella's ribs while there's a little slack in them. The \"ribs\" are the slender metal spokes that support the canopy of an umbrella while it's open. Prop your umbrella upside down or clamp it upright between your knees so you'll be free to work on it with both hands. In this position, the ribs will still be slightly bent, which will make it easier to manipulate the main connector pieces."

Pinch the ends of both ribs close together so that you can see through both holes.

It may help to hold the rib ends together with the fingers of your free hand while you focus on guiding the wire through.
