    "text": " Purchase 3 boxes of various sizes. You can buy these in round or square shaped. The best option is to purchase hat boxes with lids. Flip the boxes over so that the lid side is down. The lid can be used to give the effect of ribbon trimming the bottom of each layer. Cut a slit into the bottom of the smallest box. Make sure the opening is centered on the box and wide enough for wedding guests to slip cards through. Cut the lid, but leave space around the rim so you can attach it later. Arrange the boxes on top of each other with the largest on the bottom. Use a pencil and trace around the outside of the middle and top layers. Separate the boxes again. Now with the reference line penciled in for the top box, use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the middle of the tracing out. Leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) on the inside of the tracing so the top layer will be able to sit on top of the middle layer without falling through. Trace and cut the same size hole from the lid to the middle box. This will allow for the cards to past through the wedding cake-shaped box to hold more cards. Proceed to cutting out the same pattern on the bottom of the largest box. You will not need to cut the lid. Use a hot glue gun to attach the boxes together. Start first by hot gluing the lids to the smallest and middle sized boxes. Apply hot glue around the opening cut in the middle box. Make sure to use enough glue, staying within the pencil lines that should still be visible. Immediately flip the middle box onto the bottom of the bottom box before the hot glue hardens. Repeat this process using the smallest box and attach it to the middle box.  Paint the boxes white or in a color similar to your wedding cake. Use one of your wedding colors to paint the rim of the lids. Using small brushes for this will reduce painting the wrong areas and having to do touch-ups. Add decorations to finish the project. You may hand paint designs, hot glue on pearls or beads, or use rub-on appliques with your monograms. Place silk flowers on top of the wedding card box. Affix them using the hot glue gun. Make sure not to block the opening so cards may go through easily. Finished. ",
