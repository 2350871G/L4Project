Place two sticks across the opening of your mold, one to either side of the wick. The wick should be sandwiched between the two sticks. This will hold the wick straight up while you pour the wax. Heating and Pouring the Wax Set up a double boiler. Fill a large saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water, and place it on a stove. Place a spouted melting pot inside the saucepan. You can buy spouted melting pots from the candle making section of an arts and crafts shop. If you can't find any, use a heat-safe, glass measuring cup instead. Add the candle wax into the melting pot and heat it between 260\u00b0F and 275\u00b0F (126\u00b0C and 135\u00b0C). Use a candy or cooking thermometer to gauge the temperature. You can use wax flakes or wax cubes. How much wax you melt will depend on how big your mold is. Plan on having some extra wax handy for the second pour, however, as the wax will sink into the sand. Don't add any color or fragrance into the wax yet. The high temperature may change the color and ruin the scent. Never leave the melting wax unattended.

Don't be alarmed if the wax starts to sink into the sand. You will add more wax later. Consider pouring the wax over the back of a spoon to prevent too much splattering. Keep your face away from the mold and wax; there may be some splattering. Wait for your first pour of wax to set. As the wax sets, it will sink into the sand. This is normal, and is what creates that sandy shell. Heat more wax for your second pour, this time between 175\u00b0F and 190\u00b0F (80\u00b0C and 88\u00b0C). Use a higher temperature if you want a thicker shell, and a lower temperature if you want a thinner shell. Consider adding some color or fragrance. Because you are using a lower temperature, you don't have to worry about the color or scent changing. Try using some ocean or tropical-themed scents, such as:\nOcean breeze\nCoconut\nOrchid\nPomegranate Pour the wax slowly into the mold, all the way to the top. Again, keep your face away from the mold and wax, in case of any splattering. Because your mold is already filled with a wax shell, this second pouring of wax won't sink into the sand as much. Finishing the Candle Let the candle sit overnight. The wax may set up sooner than that, but you will need to wait for the sand to dry as well. If you pull the candle out too soon, the sand may not stick properly. Remove the candle from the sand carefully the next day. Use a spoon to loosen the sand around the candle, then carefully lift the candle out. Gently brush the excess sand off using a soft-bristled brush.
