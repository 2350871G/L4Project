If you have completed your apprenticeship in New Jersey or another state, but have not yet completed a year of board approved work experience, then you should apply to be a journeyman. Fewer restrictions apply to journeymen than to master plumbers, since most journeymen are gaining the experience to become a master plumber. If you have completed both an apprenticeship and work as a journeyman, usually totaling 5 years or more, then you should apply to become a master plumber.
