The old, dead coat should then be hand-plucked so a new coat can grow in its place. Your dog is ready to be stripped when its coat is so long that it forms a part down the center of its back. Stripping is the process of pulling out dead hair by hand. It\u2019s a common grooming practice for wiry, double-coated terriers. Since the hair is dead, it\u2019s easy to pluck out without causing any pain. With practice, you might be able to strip the entire coat in around 30 to 60 minutes. However, it will most likely take several 30 to 60 minute sessions if you\u2019re a beginner. You should not cut a border terrier\u2019s coat with electric clippers.

While it might be a bit tedious, stripping is relatively simple. Just be patient, and work little by little over the course of a few days if you or your dog get antsy.

Finally, strip the final third, or the tip, 1 to 2 weeks after stripping the middle section. The base, middle, and tip will then grow at different rates, and the tail will come to a point like a carrot. The breed standard specifies a tapered tail. If you\u2019re not worried about meeting the standard, just shape the tail into a point as best you can. Leave some hair at the base and gradually pluck more hair as you get to the tip.

If the hair doesn't come out easily or if plucking seems to hurt your dog, the coat isn't ready to be stripped. It might be helpful to look at a visual reference while you strip. Search online or in a dog breed guidebook for pictures of freshly stripped border terriers. Start behind its head and work your way down its back. The easiest place to start is behind your dog\u2019s neck and shoulders. Stand behind it, grasp a patch of skin, and pluck of pinch of old hair toward yourself (toward the dog\u2019s tail). Continue stripping its back in small, even sections. Your dog might be confused or alarmed the first time you strip its coat. Reassure it with generous praise and have its favorite treats handy. Try to pluck for at least 10 to 15 minutes, but don\u2019t force your dog if gets stressed. Take a break, and make another attempt when your dog is mellow. Give it plenty of breaks when you strip its flank, belly, and bottom. After stripping your dog's back, move on to the sides of it body, stomach, and rear end. Remember to hold the skin flat, and pluck a few hairs at a time in small sections. These areas are more sensitive than the back, so take breaks whenever your dog gets antsy. While it might be a bit tedious, stripping is relatively simple. Just be patient, and work little by little over the course of a few days if you or your dog get antsy. When you\u2019re finished stripping the body, you should see your dog\u2019s undercoat, and its appearance should be neat and tidy instead of shaggy and unkempt. Strip the legs down the top of each foot. Pluck the hair on the front and back side of each limb. Hold the skin flat and pull small pinches of hair downward, or toward the feet. Strip the top of each foot, but leave the hair that grows over the paw pads. Use scissors to trim the hair that grows around the paw pads. Move on to the head and ears. Pluck even smaller pinches from the head and face, as these areas require more attention to detail. Start by removing dead hair from the top of the head, down between the eyes, and around the edges of the eyes. Then carefully pluck tiny pinches of long, dead hair on the outside of its ears. Pluck hair on the ears toward the points of the ears. When stripping the head and face, it\u2019s wise to have a visual reference on hand. For helpful images, search online for \u201cborder terrier head study.\u201d Tidy its face, but leave short whiskers around its muzzle. Border terriers shouldn\u2019t have elaborate facial hair like other terrier breeds. However, you should leave short whiskers, or hair that grows around its muzzle. Pinch long, scraggly hairs to tidy the muzzle, then continue plucking along its jawline. Don\u2019t leave a beard or long hair below the jawline. Step back often to make sure you\u2019re stripping the face and muzzle evenly. Whiskers don\u2019t grow as fast as the rest of the coat, so any mistakes will last for months. Taper your dog\u2019s tail so it resembles a carrot. One way to taper the tail is strip it over the course of 3 to 4 weeks. When you strip the rest of your dog\u2019s body, pluck the bottom third of the tail, or the base. Let the coat grow for 1 to 2 weeks, then strip the tail\u2019s middle third. Finally, strip the final third, or the tip, 1 to 2 weeks after stripping the middle section. The base, middle, and tip will then grow at different rates, and the tail will come to a point like a carrot. The breed standard specifies a tapered tail. If you\u2019re not worried about meeting the standard, just shape the tail into a point as best you can. Leave some hair at the base and gradually pluck more hair as you get to the tip. Pinch smaller amounts of fur around your dog\u2019s rear end and tail, as these are sensitive areas. Trim the groin, inner hind legs, and paw pads with scissors. Use blunt safety scissors to carefully trim around the inner thighs, lower abdomen, and genitals. Then hold the scissors flat against the bottom of each foot and trim the hair that grows around the paw pads. The area between your dog\u2019s hind legs is sensitive, and hair there doesn\u2019t grow as long as the rest of its body. Just use scissors on the thin hair that covers the sensitive areas; the upper abdomen and chest should be plucked by hand.",
