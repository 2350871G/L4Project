For example, if you lost your coat on the playground, you should check in the office\u2019s Lost and Found rather than addressing the issue in a letter to your principal. Before deciding to write a letter to your principal, ask yourself a few questions. Is this issue important enough to ask my principal about? Is there someone else who could help me with this problem? Can my principal do anything to help solve my problem? Other people who might be able to help you solve a problem include your parents, your teacher, the school secretary, and the school guidance counselor. If you can\u2019t decide who would be the best person to ask, try making an appointment with your guidance counselor and ask their advice."

If you can\u2019t decide who would be the best person to ask, try making an appointment with your guidance counselor and ask their advice. Take notes that define the problem. Whether you\u2019re writing a letter to your principal about a bully, a difficult teacher, or a bad school policy, it is important to think about what the problem is and why it bothers you. You\u2019ll need a clear understanding of the issue to write an effective letter. Make a list of reasons why you think the issue needs attention. Consider the impact. In your notes, jot down ideas about why the issue affects you or people you know. For instance, perhaps you think there's not enough time to eat lunch. Flesh out why that is a hardship: you rush through your meal and never finish. Writing Your Response Begin writing a draft of the full letter. You can type your response on the computer or write it out by hand. The main goal here is to just start writing so that you have something to work with. You can revise and perfect it later. Introduce yourself. You need to let your principal know right way who wrote the letter s/he is reading. Begin with an introduction that identifies who you are and why you are writing to your principal. You can write something simple like, \"My name is Sam Jones. I\u2019m in the 8th grade, and I am upset about the short lunch period.\" Identify the problem. The body of the letter should specify your complaint. This is where the gloves come off. Write in detail about the problem. Explain how it affects you or people you know. Address your desired outcome. What is the point of writing this letter? What action do you hope your principal will take when s/he reads your letter? This is your desired outcome. You need to be clear about what you hope will happen as a result of your letter being read.

Round off the letter by recapping the important points in a few lines. Ask the principal to arrange a meeting to discuss the issues raised in your letter. Sign your name and identify your homeroom so the principal can reply. Revising Your Letter Review your draft and make changes to it. Correct the letter for a final version and make two copies, one to hand in and one for yourself. If you submit a handwritten letter, make certain it is legible. This may mean re-writing the letter once you have made all the corrections you want to make. Use your best handwriting for this letter. Use a positive tone. Your letter should be polite and mature. Remember that you are addressing your principal (who is kind of like your boss!) and you should address them in a respectful way.
