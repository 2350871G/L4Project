First-degree burns are very common, and they are the result of brief contact with something hot (such as a stove, hot pan, or the sun). First-degree burns affect only the outermost layer of skin, and can usually be treated at home. Symptoms to look for include:\nRed skin that is painful to touch. Skin that tingles. Skin that is dry to the touch. Slight swelling. Very severe sunburn or any first-degree burn that covers a large area of your body should be looked at by a doctor."

Many second-degree burns can still be treated at home. In addition to the symptoms of first-degree burns, characteristics of second-degree burns include: blotchy skin, blisters, and mild to severe pain. However, you should seek medical attention right away if:\nYour second-degree burn is on your hands, feet, groin, or face. Your burn results in severe blisters.

These burns may or may not cause a lot of pain, but pain during recovery is usually more severe than with less severe burns. Third-degree burns occur when a heat source penetrates multiple layers of your skin. These burns are serious, and should not be treated at home. If you experience a third-degree burn, it is crucial for you to get to a hospital as soon as possible. Symptoms you may notice include:\nRed or white skin. Color that is unaffected when pressure is applied. Lack of blistering. Destroyed tissue. Third-degree burns are incredibly susceptible to infection. It is important that you do not touch or attempt to treat your third degree burn. Instead, seek medical attention immediately."
