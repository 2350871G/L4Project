Sebum, one of these natural oils, can build up and clog pores, but you can use another oil to dissolve it. A gentle natural oil will clean and moisturize your skin without stripping it like soap can. \u201cNon-comedogenic\u201d means that the oil will not clog your pores and cause acne. (You should also look for the \u201cnon-comedogenic\u201d label on cosmetics and anything else you put on your skin.) Choose a pure, organic oil that is cold-pressed for best results. The American Academy of Dermatology uses a ranking from 0-5 to determine how likely a substance is to clog pores. 0 will almost never clog pores, and 5 will very likely clog pores. Hemp seed oil (0) is rated a 0 out of 5. It is a relative of the cannabis plant and contains sterols, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids, but very low levels of THC (the \u201cactive\u201d compound in cannabis). Shea butter (0) needs to be gently heated before using and is usually sold as a wax. It is high in vitamin E, an antioxidant. Sunflower oil (0) contains polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E.\nArgan oil (0) is rich in vitamin E, carotenes, and essential fatty acids. It is also used to treat skin infections. Castor oil (1) can treat inflammation. It contains essential fatty acids and a natural anti-microbial acid. It may be drying to some people\u2019s skin. Calendula oil (1) may help reduce the appearance of acne scars. Almond (2), hazelnut (2), and olive oil (2) are non-comedogenic for most people. Experiment with a few base oils.

        "It can cause irritation, scarring, and actually increase acne.",
        "Avoid using harsh scrubbing brushes or products with \u201cexfoliators\u201d such as micro-beads.",

        "If you have moderate (more than 20-100 pimples, with about 15-50 inflamed or infected) to severe (more than 100 comedones, pimples, pustules, nodules) acne, see your doctor before using any at-home treatment for acne.",
        "You may only inflame your current condition with at-home treatments.",
        "Many health insurance providers in the US require you to get a referral from your general physician before you can see a specialist such as a dermatologist.",
        "Check with your health insurance provider to avoid any surprise costs.",
        "Ask about medications.",
        "If natural remedies are not working for you, then your doctor may recommend a benzoyl peroxide product to start.",
        "However, if this does not cure your acne, then your doctor may offer you a prescription treatment, such as a topical retinoid medicine, an oral antibiotic, or an oral contraceptive (for women).",

        "For example, if retinoids are not helpful for your acne, then your doctor may switch you to dapsone 5% gel instead or suggest an oral contraceptive if  you are a woman.",

        "However, this medicine can cause some severe side effects, so those who take it must be closely monitored.",
        "Understanding Acne Know what acne is.",
        "Acne happens when dead skin cells and sebum (an oil naturally produced by your body) build up in pores, causing them to clog.",
        "These clogged pores, called comedones, are what are commonly called \u201cwhiteheads\u201d and \u201cblackheads.\u201d\nA whitehead is a \u201cclosed\u201d comedone.",
        "The dead skin cells and sebum in the pore are not exposed to the air.",
        "A blackhead is an \u201copen\u201d comedone.",
        "The dead skin cells and sebum are exposed to the air, causing them to oxygenate and turn black.",
        "They are not dirt and cannot be washed away.",
        "A type of bacteria that lives on your skin, Propionibacterium acnes, can also get inside pores.",
        "This bacteria causes redness and inflammation in the pore.",
        "Pimples, cysts, and nodules can result from inflamed pores that fill with pus.",
        "Understand what causes acne.",
        "There are many causes for acne.",
        "Hormonal changes in your body, your skin care regimen, products you use, and stress can all affect acne.",
        "A change in hormones, particularly testosterone, can stimulate the glands to produce more oil, causing a greater likelihood of developing acne (hence why it\u2019s often an issue for teens).",
        "Acne may also get worse for women who are on their period or pregnant.",
        "Some cosmetics and skin-care products, such as lotions, can clog pores and cause acne breakouts.",
        "Alcohol-based cleansers and other harsh skin products can cause skin irritation that can lead to acne.",
        "Excessive sweating and tight clothing can cause your pores to clog and lead to acne.",
        "Genetics may play a role in who develops acne.",
        "Some sunscreens may irritate your skin and cause acne-like bumps.",
        "Choose a sunscreen such as zinc dioxide or titanium dioxide instead.",
        "Know what doesn\u2019t cause acne.",
        "There are many myths about acne.",
        "Knowing what does not cause acne can help you make wise, healthy choices and not feel bad about yourself.",
        "A common myth is that acne is caused by diet.",
        "No food directly causes acne.",
        "However, low-glycemic index (GI) foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and yogurt, may reduce the severity of acne.",
        "Acne is not caused by poor hygiene.",
        "Some evidence suggests that washing your face twice a day is more effective than washing just once for adolescents, but in general, you don\u2019t develop acne because you\u2019re \u201cdirty.\u201d"
