Repeat so you have two identical pieces. Measure and mark a vertical center line (2 \u00be\u201d from edge) on one of the pieces. Use this centerline to measure off the top and bottom cuts. Next, measure and mark a horizontal line (2 \u00be\u201d from top) for the intersection point. Connect points to outline the coffin top and bottom. Since the top and bottom need to be identical, attach the boards together before cutting. Nails can be used on the portions that you plan to remove. Cut the boards to match the outline.
