Many people prefer briquettes because they catch easily, burn longer and are inexpensive. Choose hardwood charcoal for a more intense flavor. Hardwood charcoal burns out faster than briquettes but gives your meat a delicious, smoky flavor. Use a mix of briquettes and charcoal. You\u2019ll still get the classic barbecue flavor of the charcoal, but combined with the long-lasting burn of the briquettes. Lighting Charcoal with Lighter Fluid Group the coals in a pyramid shape at the bottom of the grill. The heat can rise from the bottom and the coals will help light each other, spreading the heat from one coal to the next. Pour out enough charcoal or briquettes to form an even layer on the bottom of your grill. Use more coal in cold or wet weather for a longer burn.

Pour in enough charcoal to reach about to the top of the chimney or just below it. Stuff newspaper in the bottom of the chimney. Crumple the newspaper loosely and stuff it so that the bottom of the chimney is full, but not too tightly to suffocate the flame. Place the chimney on the cooking grate and light the newspaper. Use a match or lighter and wear heat-safe rubber gloves. Let the charcoal burn until it\u2019s white-gray with ash. Give it about 20-30 minutes to burn, supervising the flame closely.
