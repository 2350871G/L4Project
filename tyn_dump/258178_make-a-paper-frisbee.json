You can use printer paper or origami paper, which will be thin and easy to fold. You will also need a ruler and glue. You can use thicker paper like cardstock but make sure they are 3\u201d x 3\u201d as this will make it easier to fold and fit the pieces of paper together."

Use your fingers or the ruler to make a nice, even crease. Repeat these steps for the remaining seven pieces of paper. Make sure the folds are on the same side. For example, if the first piece is folded so the left top corner touches the bottom left corner of the paper, you should do this for the remaining pieces of paper.

Turn one of the folded pieces so the point of the smaller triangle faces to the left and the right point of the larger triangle faces to the right. Place a small dot of glue on the top corner of the folded piece where the smaller triangle and the larger triangle form a straight line. Slide the section with the glue into the pocket of the second folded piece of paper. The pocket will be formed by the smaller triangle section of the folded piece of paper.
