        "It may work on ones made out of glass or plastic.",
        "Use nail polish remover to wipe away any excess nail polish.",
        "Dip a cotton ball in nail polish remover it, then use it to wipe away any excess nail polish from the rim and the inside of the tumbler.",
        "If you are using a plastic tumbler, avoid using a nail polish remover with acetone in it, as acetone can fog or discolor certain types of plastic, such as acrylic.",
        "Pat the tumbler dry with a paper towel.",
        "At this point, you can set your tumbler aside to dry, or you can repeat the method with more colors of nail polish.",
        "Let the tumbler dry overnight.",
        "Set the tumbler upside down on a sheet of paper, a wire cooling rack, or a baking sheet.",
        "This will give the nail polish time to set, and prevent the bottom from getting stuck to anything.",
        "Consider adding a glossy, clear, acrylic sealer over the design using a sponge brush.",
        "If you are using a glass type tumbler, getting the sealer within 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the rim.",
        "If this is the travel-mug kind of tumbler, you can coat the entire tumbler with sealer.",
        "You can apply more than one coat of sealer, but be sure to let each coat dry first before you apply a new one.",
        "You can also use clear nail polish or an acrylic spray sealer.",
        "Use the tumbler with care.",
        "Even though nail polish sticks better to glass and ceramic better than regular types of paint, it is still fragile.",
        "Wash the tumbler by hand using cool water and a soft cloth.",
        "Never let the tumbler sit in water, and don't wash it in the washing machine.",
        "Using Glass Paint Clean your glass tumbler with rubbing alcohol.",
        "Soak a paper towel or cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the surface of your glass tumbler with it.",
        "Set the tumbler aside, and let them dry.",
        "This should only take a few seconds.",
        "Wrap tape around the middle of your glass tumbler.",
        "You can position the tape a quarter of the way up, half way up, or even three-quarters of the way.",
        "You can have the tape perfectly straight, or at an angle.",
        "The area below the tape is the area that you will paint.",
        "The area above the paint will be left clear.",
        "Run your fingernail over the tape to seal it and remove any air bubbles.",
        "You can also use a credit card or gift card instead.",
        "If you are into scrapbooking, you could even use a bone folder.",
        "Apply the glass paint to the area below the tape.",
        "Pour out some glass paint onto a paper plate or palette.",
        "Dip a foam pouncer into the paint, then tap the paint onto the tumbler.",
        "Hold the tumbler by the top or by the inside.",
        "Try not to touch the area you will be painting; any oils from your skin may prevent the paint from sticking.",
        "Don't worry if the paint doesn't go on evenly.",
        "You'll be adding a second coat shortly, which will resolve this.",
        "Wait 2 hours for the paint to dry, then apply another coat.",
        "Don't remove the tape, and use the same tapping motion as before.",
        "The paint should be more even now.",
        "If it isn't, repeat this step one more time.",
        "Set the tumbler upside down while it dries so that it doesn't get stuck.",
        "Let the paint dry for another 2 hours, then carefully peel the painters tape away.",
        "Once again, make sure that you place the tumbler upside down when you set it out to dry, or the tumbler may get stuck to your work surface.",
        "Cure the glass paint.",
        "Each brand will be a little different, so read the instructions on the paint jar or on the company's website.",
        "In general, however, you'd want to let the paint cure for several days, then bake the tumbler in the oven.",
        "Some brands may be cured without an oven, but require at around 21 days' curing.",
        "Use the tumbler with care.",
        "Glass paint is pretty durable once it is cured.",
        "Some brands can even be top-rack dishwasher safe, depending on how they are cured.",
        "Nonetheless, don't let the tumbler soak or stand in water.",
        "It is always best to wash it by hand with a soft cloth or sponge.",
        "Using Glitter Get a tumbler.",
        "This method works best for those plastic traveling mugs that you use for coffee, but it might work on glass or ceramic tumblers too.",
        "Keep in mind that decoupage glue does not stick very well to glass or ceramic, so your design may not last as long.",
        "Wrap a strip of painter's tape around the tumbler.",
        "You can wrap the tape as high or as low as you'd like.",
        "The area below the tape will get the glitter, while the area above the tape will be left blank.",
        "Cut slits into the top edge of the tape before pressing it down.",
        "This will allow it to conform to the tumbler better.",
        "Smooth out any wrinkles in the tape.",
        "Don't worry so much about the top edge of the tape.",
        "Make sure that the bottom edge is as smooth as possible, however, or your design won't end up crisp and neat.",
        "If there are any gaps caused by the slits you made, fill them in with more painter's tape.",
        "Wipe down the tumbler using rubbing alcohol.",
        "Soak a paper towel or cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the tumbler.",
        "If your tumbler is very smooth, consider buffing it with fine-grit sandpaper first.",
        "This will give the decoupage glue something to stick to.",
        "Apply thick coat of decoupage glue.",
        "Using a paintbrush, apply a generous amount of decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) to the tumbler below the tape.",
        "It's okay if you got some decoupage onto the tape.",
        "When you pull the tape away at the very end, you will pull away the excess decoupage and reveal a nice, crisp line.",
        "Use your brush to wipe off any excess decoupage.",
        "Start by brushing downward across the decoupage, from the painter's tape down to the edge of the tumbler.",
        "Wipe the brush off on the rim of the decoupage bottle, then move onto the next section.",
        "Keep doing this until an even layer of glue remains and you can't see any streaks.",
        "Shake on some fine glitter.",
        "Hold your tumbler over a paper plate or a sheet of paper.",
        "Choose some fine, scrapbooking glitter in a color that you like.",
        "Shake the glitter over the tumbler, rotating the tumbler while doing so.",
        "Don't worry if the glitter doesn't come out even.",
        "You'll be adding a second coat shortly.",
        "Let the tumbler dry for 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Carefully set the tumbler upside down on a sheet of paper, with the glittered portion facing up.",
        "Wait 1 to 2 hours for it to dry.",
        "In the meantime, you can use your paper plate to transfer the glitter back into its container.",
        "Apply another coat of decoupage and another coat of glitter.",
        "Once again, brush on a thick coat of decoupage.",
        "This time, be sure to extend it just past the glitter and onto the bottom edge of the tumbler.",
        "Wipe the excess decoupage off, just like before, and shake some more glitter onto it.",
        "Wait for the decoupage to dry, then apply two more coats of decoupage, allowing each coat to dry.",
        "Allow the glitter to dry first, about 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Next, apply a thick coat of decoupage, wipe away any excess, and let it dry for 1 to 2 hours.",
        "Apply a second and final coat of decoupage, wipe off any excess, and let it dry.",
        "When applying these last two coats of decoupage, be sure to extend it just past the glitter and onto the bottom edge of the tumbler.",
        "This helps to seal the glitter in.",
        "Carefully peel the tape away.",
        "Lift the tape straight up rather than downwards so that you don't accidentally peel off the glitter.",
        "Discard the tape when you are done.",
        "Seal the top edge in, and let it dry.",
        "Using small, downward strokes, apply some decoupage to the top edge of the glitter part of your tumbler.",
        "When you are done, there should be a thin line of decoupage between the glittered and plain parts of the tumbler.",
        "This helps to seal in the glitter further.",
        "At this point, your tumbler is done.",
        "You can make it fancier by adding vinyl letters or designs, or sketching on patterns using a permanent marker.",
        "Allow the tumbler to dry completely before using it.",
        "Each brand of decoupage glue will be a little different, so be sure to refer to the packaging.",
        "Once the glue is dry, your tumbler is ready to use.",
        "You should only wash the inside and upper rim.",
        "If the glittered part gets dirty, wipe it down with a damp cloth, then dry it immediately.",
        "Do not let the tumbler sit in water or wash it in the dishwasher, or the glitter will peel away."
