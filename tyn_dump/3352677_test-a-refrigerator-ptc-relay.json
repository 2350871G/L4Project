        "They usually cost anywhere between $20-80 USD.",
        "If you can\u2019t find the model number on the PTC relay, then search for the refrigerator model you have so you can buy a piece that fits inside.",
        "Try testing the compressor before getting a new PTC relay to make sure it\u2019s not the cause of the problem.",
        "Testing the Compressor Put the probes of a multimeter on the left and right prongs of the compressor.",
        "Locate the 3 prongs that the PTC relay plugs into on the side of your compressor.",
        "Put one probe on the prong that\u2019s furthest to the left and the other probe on the prong on the right to take a resistance reading.",
        "Write down the measurement so you don\u2019t forget it.",
        "The prongs will be shaped like a triangle that\u2019s right-side up or upside-down.",
        "Use the prongs that are horizontally across from one another for the first measurement.",
        "The resistance between the 2 prongs will vary depending on the fridge model and compressor.",
        "Measure the resistance between the leftmost and the third prong.",
        "Continue holding one of the probes against the leftmost prong on the compressor.",
        "Move the other probe to the third pin, which will either be on the top or bottom depending on how the prongs are laid out.",
        "Write down the resistance measurement you take between the 2 prongs.",
        "If the prongs are configured in an upside-down triangle, then the third prong will be on the bottom.",
        "If they form a right-side up triangle, then the third prong will be on the top.",
        "Hold the probes on the prongs for at least 5-10 seconds or until the resistance settles on a single reading.",
        "Find the measurement from the rightmost and third prongs.",
        "Keep the probe on the third prong and move the other probe so it\u2019s on the rightmost one.",
        "Keep the probes on the multimeter for at least 5 seconds so you can get an accurate reading.",
        "Check the multimeter to find the resistance measurement and write it down so you don\u2019t forget it.",
        "Add the lowest 2 readings to see if they\u2019re within 0.5 \u03a9 of the largest reading.",
        "Take the smallest 2 resistance readings from the compressor and add them together to find the total.",
        "Compare the sum of the 2 readings to the highest resistance measurement you took to see how close they are.",
        "If the sum of the 2 readings is within 0.5 \u03a9 of the highest reading you took, then the compressor is okay.",
        "If the readings are higher or lower than the threshold, then you need to call someone to repair or replace the compressor for you.",
        "Compressors can be expensive to fix, so you may want to buy a new refrigerator instead.",
        "If the compressor still works, then there may be a problem with the internal fan.",
        "Contact a repair person to take a look at your fridge to further diagnose the problem."
