For example:\nSweet flavored crackers and cookies might pair better with sweeter flavored skyr, like vanilla or strawberry. When dipping foods that are more savory into the skyr, a plain or savory flavor will likely pair best. Try mixing a little olive, salt, and pepper into it and eating it with crackers."
