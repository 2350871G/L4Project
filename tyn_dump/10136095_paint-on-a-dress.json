If you're only painting a small area, however, choose a piece of cardboard that's a little bit bigger than your design. The cardboard will prevent the paint from soaking into the back of the dress. Make sure that the cardboard is behind the area that you'll be painting. If the cardboard is not big enough for the painted design, you'll have to work in smaller sections and move the cardboard around as you paint."

The more water you add, the more translucent the paint will be, sort of like watercolor paints. Use a few drops of water if you want to make the paint thick enough for details. Don't use more than a 1-to-4 ratio of water to paint, otherwise it will be too thin. Don't use puffy paint or dimensional fabric paint. It's not the same thing."

If you are using a stencil, however, tap the paint on with a pouncer, starting from the outside edges of the stencil. Use small, pointy brushes for details and wide, flat brushes for larger areas. Foam brushes will also work for large areas. A pouncer is a type of foam brush, but instead of a chisel-shape, it's cylindrical. You can find it in the stencil or tie dye section of a craft store."

        "The paint may look alright at first, but once it absorbs into the fabric, it may look patchy.",
        "If this happens to you, simply apply another coat of paint using the same technique as before and let it dry.",
        "You may need to apply 2 to 3 coats of paint total.",
        "How long the paint takes to dry depends on what you are using.",
        "Expect to wait around 15 to 20 minutes; double-check the paint label to be sure, however.",
        "Remove the masking tape or stencils once the paint has dried.",
        "At this point, you can fill in any chips with spare paint and a small brush.",
        "If you want to soften any hard lines created by the masking tape, just spray over the edge to soften it up.",
        "Once the paint has dried, you can remove the dress from the dress form.",
        "Iron the dress to set the paint, if needed.",
        "Most types of fabric paints need to be ironed in order to stick.",
        "Double-check the label to be sure, however.",
        "You should also read the care tag inside the dress as not everything can be ironed.",
        "Heat setting the fabric helps make the paint permanent, allowing you to wash the garment.",
        "You may not be able to dry clean it afterwards, however.",
        "If you can\u2019t iron the fabric, then you can\u2019t heat set the paint.",
        "You will have to be extra careful with the dress and spot-clean it only.",
        "Read the dress's care tag and the paint's label for washing directions.",
        "If the paint says that it's not waterproof, then you won't be able to wash the dress.",
        "You may be able to dry clean it, but ask the dry cleaners.",
        "In most cases, handwashing the dress in cold water and then hanging it out to dry would be the best.",
        "Sometimes, you'll have to choose the safer option.",
        "For example, if the dress says \"warm water\" and the paint says \"cold,\" stick with cold water."
