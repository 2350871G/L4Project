Choose the best quality apples available to you in order to get the best apple cider vinegar at the end. For a more complex and deep vinegar at the end, try using a combination of different apples. Use two sweet apples, such as Golden Delicious or Gala, with one sharp tasting apple, such as McIntosh or Liberty, for a slightly sharper vinegar at the end. Instead of using whole apples, save scraps from apples used in other dishes to make your apple cider vinegar. One whole apple is roughly equivalent to the scraps of two apples.

Give your apples a thorough rinse and scrub with cold water to clean away anything you don't want in your vinegar. You can use any number of apples you want to make apple cider vinegar. The more you use, the more vinegar you\u2019ll get! If you\u2019re just starting out making your own apple cider vinegar, try using 3 apples for your first batch. This will give you a good amount of vinegar but won\u2019t put too much at risk if something goes wrong. If you're using apple scraps, make sure to wash the whole apples before separating the scraps from the rest of the apples."

For a quart jar with three apples, you\u2019ll need around 800 millilitres (27  fl oz) of water. Use more or less as is needed. It\u2019s always better to add too much water than not enough. If you add too much, your apple cider vinegar might be a little weaker or take longer to ferment. If you don\u2019t add enough water, some apple will be exposed and might begin to rot and ruin your vinegar entirely."
