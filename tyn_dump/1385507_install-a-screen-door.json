Think of these measurements like a grid across the opening of your door. The average door height is usually 80 inches (200 cm), and some standard widths are 36 inches (91 cm), 32 inches (81 cm), and 30 inches (76 cm). Your door frame will most likely measure a little bit more than one of those standard door sizes. If you have to use a tall step stool or ladder to take these measurements, or for any other part during the installation process, have someone hold the stool or ladder in place. It is dangerous to work on a ladder without someone to help you."

The most common ones are made of wood, but there are aluminum and vinyl screen doors as well. A wide selection of these options can be found either online or at your local home improvement or hardware store. Unfinished pine screen doors are great to have when working on a tight budget. The average door will cost around $30.00 USD (25.49 Euros). The simple design and unfinished wood will give you the option to stain or paint it whatever color you desire. Choose a classic white trim, a rustic stain, or a bold paint color that will contrast traditional siding. If you decide to paint the door, use exterior paint so it can withstand the elements. Vinyl and aluminum screen doors are simple and easy to install. These are offered in standard, neutral colors and shades, and will not require you to paint them before installing. The starting price for these doors typically start at $50.00 (42.48 Euros) and increase from there between brands. Look for screen doors that break away from traditional models by purchasing one made of hardwood or one that has a unique design. Either of these types of screen doors will make an excellent statement piece for the front of your home. The starting costs for these designs can vary greatly, but at most you may pay $200.00 (169.93 Euros)."
