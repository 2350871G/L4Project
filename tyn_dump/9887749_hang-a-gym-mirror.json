These mirrors are large and awkward to carry and hold. Count on needing help. Scheduling ahead of time will make it stress-free for both of you. Provide your friend with work gloves and ask them to wear close-toed shoes. Clean the entire wall space that will be covered by the mirror. Use cleaning wipes, rubbing alcohol, or warm soapy water.

When the machine indicates a stud, either by beeping or a red light flashing, make a mark with your pencil.

Screw in each support screw to hold the J bar in place. If your J bar is long, have another person hold the opposite end in place as you drill. Mounting the Mirror Determine the spacing of the mirror clips. Divide the width of the mirror into 3 and come in that distance from each side. Use masking tape to mark each spot. For example, if your mirror is 3 feet (0.91 m) wide, place a piece of tape 1 foot (0.30 m) in from each end. Load the bottom edge of the mirror into the J bar so you can mark for the mirror clips. Have your helper hold the mirror in place while you climb up your step ladder. Make pencil marks on the wall just above each piece of tape.
