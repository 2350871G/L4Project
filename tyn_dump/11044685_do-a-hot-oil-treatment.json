                    "description": "Coconut oil is a popular choice for hot oil treatments because it\u2019s lightweight and absorbs easily. This means it will help moisturize and protect your hair without leaving a greasy film. Choose coconut oil if you want extra moisture or aren\u2019t sure which oil is right for you. It\u2019s normal for coconut oil to be solid at room temperature. However, it will melt when it\u2019s heated, making it easy to apply to your hair."

                    "description": "Avocado oil will add extra moisture to your hair and may improve the texture of your hair, as well. It\u2019s a great option if your hair is really dry because it adds more moisture than lightweight oils but isn\u2019t so thick that it sits on your hair shaft. Pick avocado oil as a treatment for dry or very dry hair. Avocado oil retains its nutrients even when it\u2019s heated to high temperatures, so it\u2019s easy to use for hot oil treatments."

Additionally, it may help with scalp conditions, like dandruff. If you want to relieve scalp irritation, try jojoba oil. Keep in mind that oil treatments may make some scalp conditions worse.

How fast and how long your hair can grow depends heavily on genetics, but for most people hair grows at a rate of 0.5 in (1.3 cm) per month.

However, it\u2019s also a heavier oil, so it may not absorb as well as other lightweight oils, like coconut oil. Because it coats your shaft, it will help protect your ends. Use it if you\u2019d like to prevent split ends. Don\u2019t use a lot of olive oil on your hair, as it will weigh your hair down and might cause it to look greasy. Apply just enough to create a thin layer on your hair. When using olive oil, apply more oil to the ends of your hair than to your roots so your hair won\u2019t look greasy."
