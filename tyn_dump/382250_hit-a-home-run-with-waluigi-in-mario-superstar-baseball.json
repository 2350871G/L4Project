Not late enough that he misses the pitch, but just late enough so that it goes to the left part of the field. Waluigi is left handed, and most lefties pull the ball towards right field, but with Waluigi this doesn't work. It will actually be less powerful if he pulls it right."

And if you hit it perfectly, the ball will land fair or hit the pole, both resulting in a home run just over the outfield wall. But most likely, the ball will not be hit perfectly. Either the outfielders will catch it, or it will be a foul ball. You might even miss the pitch entirely by trying to swing too late. If this is the case, just try to get the next pitch. If Waluigi is out, then exit back out to the Main Menu and try again. It may take many tries before you hit it right. But when you do, you get the satisfaction of accomplishing the hardest feat in this game - hitting a home run with Waluigi. You also get to see his almost never-before-seen home run celebration!"
