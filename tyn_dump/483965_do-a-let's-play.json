Free Downloads: D3DGear and Fraps (free version only records for limited time and uses a watermark on the video). Macs come built in with Quicktime Player, so that's cool. If you want better production values and features, consider purchasing something like Camtasia. On most of the operating systems utilising X Window System (e.g. Linux based systems, BSD software distributions, possibly Macs) you can use ffmpeg with vcodec x11grab to capture part of your desktop. It can get pretty technical, though, since ffmpeg is operated via a terminal. To capture footage from a video game console, you\u2019ll need a capture card, a video card with video inputs, a DVD recorder, a FireWire/USB converter, or a camcorder with AV inputs that you can connect directly to the console."

Your voice will sound muffled or distorted. 'Live-commentary' (creating commentary while playing the game) is difficult - especially if doing a 'blind' run. If your commentary is not confident or easily turns to dead air, consider 'Post-commentary' (recording the game footage, performing editing and then adding the commentary) instead.
