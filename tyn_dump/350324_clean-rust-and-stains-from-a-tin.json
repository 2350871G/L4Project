There are important factors to consider before using an electric sander. Sanders, flap discs and fiber discs work best on long, flat patches of rust. In contrast, wire wheels are suggested for corners and curved areas. Make sure the grinder is constantly moving so it doesn't puncture or wear away the tin. Consider using a mouse detail sander for smaller areas. Always begin with the coarsest grain and carefully move to smaller grains as the rust wears away. If there is significant scratching left on the tinware try using a fine grain sandpaper to smooth out any of the remaining marks."
