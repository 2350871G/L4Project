Turn down the heat a little if the caramel looks like it's becoming too dark or will burn. Stir in the heavy cream. Turn off the heat. Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy cream and whisk the caramel well. Don't worry if the caramel bubbles or foams up when you add the cream. Whisk in the xanthan gum and salt. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum over the caramel and whisk it in really well. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of kosher or sea salt over the caramel and whisk it in. Boil the caramel for one minute.

This will help the caramel set up and thicken. If the caramel doesn't look very thick after it's rested, you may need to microwave it for one more minute. Stir in coarse sea salt and vanilla. Carefully remove the caramel from the microwave and stir in 1/2 teaspoon of coarse sea salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Cool the caramel. Let the caramel cool completely at room temperature. Use it in your favorite recipes or as a topping for desserts. To store the caramel, just put a lid and band on the mason jar. Store it in the fridge for up to a week. Making Sugar Free Caramel Using Xylitol Combine the xylitol with agave nectar. Measure 1/2 cup (107 g) of xylitol into a small saucepan. Add 1 teaspoon of agave nectar and stir the mixture well. If you're looking for another natural sweetener, you could use honey or maple syrup instead of the agave nectar. Stir and cook the caramel for 5 minutes. Turn the heat on to medium and stir the mixture constantly. Cook the xylitol caramel until it turns golden. This should take about 5 minutes. Let the caramel cool before you use it. Avoid letting the caramel get very dark since the xylitol can burn easily. Consider thickening the caramel in the freezer. Since the xylitol caramel will be very thin, you may want to thicken it up if you'll be dipping something into it or you just want a thicker sauce.
