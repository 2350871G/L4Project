Take a picture of your keyboard before you begin so you know the proper location for each key. While you can reference photos online or consult your user manual to figure out the correct locations, a picture lets you can see the difference before and after cleaning. Unplug the keyboard and turn off any lights before you begin cleaning. Blackwidow keyboards have dazzling light displays, but these can be damaged if you leave the power on as you clean. Turn off all the settings on your keyboard and unplug it from your computer to prevent shorting or damaging your keyboard's lights. Remove letter and number keycaps by pulling them off their base.

You may need to wiggle the key covers a little bit to get them off, but simply pulling upwards should do the trick. Don't bend the keys as you pull them, as this can damage the connection.

You can also use regular cleaning wipes for this step, as they don't drip and are less likely to cause electronic damage. Opt for alcohol-infused cleaning wipes to get the best clean. Reattaching Keycaps Attach hinged keys by aligning the metal bar and slotting the hinges. On Razer Blackwidow keyboards, the metal bar at the bottom of the key goes behind the LED. Lay the metal bar behind this, then pinch the white stubs together on each side and slot them into the keyboard's base. You should hear a click. Push the keycaps back into their proper place on the keyboard. Reference the photo you took earlier to find the proper place for each keycap.
