Find the end point of the gutter run by using a 1/2-inch (.635 cm) downward slope. Starting at your high point, move down 1/2-inch for every 10 feet (3 m) of gutter. For example, if you're working on a 25 foot (7.6 m) fascia board, your end point will be roughly 1-1/4 inch below your high point. Snap a chalk line between the high and low points. Use a level or a measuring stick to try to get an even line. This will be a guidepost for your gutters, so it helps to be precise. Sizing, Cutting, and Installing the Gutters Cut the gutters to size. Use a hacksaw, or heavy duty tin snips to cut the gutter at the appropriate measurement. You may need to cut your gutters at a 45 degree angle if two gutters meet at a corner. Attach the gutter brackets on every other rafter tail. Locate each rafter tail \u2014 usually spaced every 16 inches (40.6 cm) apart \u2014 by looking for their signature nail heads.

An end cap should be used on any open-ended run of gutter. Mount the gutters. Slip the gutter into place by tilting it upward until its back end fits into place at the top of the bracket. The gutter should either snap into place or be reasonably snug. A bracket should be mounted to the face-board every 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm).
