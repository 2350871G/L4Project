Leaving the top of the box open will allow moisture to more easily infiltrate the box and penetrate through to the tobacco inside the cigars. If the cigars aren\u2019t completely dried out, leaving the lid propped open will be sufficient for allowing moisture to enter the box. For thoroughly desiccated cigars, leave the lid off. A warm, damp towel can be folded and placed beneath the stored cigar box to provide an extra boost of moisture for especially dry cigars. Just be careful to change the towel out frequently, or it might mildew."

Make sure the cigars are situated where they won\u2019t be knocked over, become wet or be exposed to direct heat or cold. This is the simplest method of rehydrating dry cigars, but also the slowest, as rehydration will occur at a very gradual rate. Though it takes time, slow rehydration works best, as moisture is returned to the cigars little by little, which keeps the cigars from becoming overhydrated. Overhydration is essentially irreversible, and can result in deadening the cigar\u2019s flavor, making it difficult to keep lit and even causing mold to grow on the tobacco."
