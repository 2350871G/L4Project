Transferring a Design onto Wood Choose which method of design transferring works best for you. While it's certainly possible to create art without the training wheels of a pencil design, most beginners find that having a design helps them. There are three basic ways to copy a design onto your piece of wood. Draw a design directly onto the wood free-handed. If you are a killer artist and drawing is your thing, you may find it fun to draw directly onto the wood you're using with a graphite pencil. It's not the easiest, most efficient way of getting down an outline, but it sidesteps the lifeless, cookie-cutter stiffness that many artists unwittingly produce when copying directly from another image.

If you're hunched over and burning perilously close to your belly, chances are it's going to be much harder to burn. Consider starting off on the bottom or outside edge of the outline.

        "If you want to try to make a wood burn image 3D instead of the customary 2D, you'll want to experiment with different tips \u2014 tips that express shades and textures.",
        "As always, a few hours of practice on the back of a scrap piece of wood will be invaluable when it comes to shading on the real deal.",
        "Move on to adding color.",
        "You are now ready to start adding color to your image.",
        "Color is optional and may look better on some images then on others.",
        "You will want to use water colors and a brush of your choice.",

        "Periodically clean your tips to make sure they're delivering maximum heat.",
        "You can run your tips over a sanding block for a quick fix, or you can clean your (cooled off) tips on a strop using aluminum oxide.",
        "This removes excess carbon that sticks to the tips.",

        "Remember to use your pliers to safely detach any and all tips.",
        "Consider using an exhaust fan while you're burning.",
        "Some woods give off more smoke than others, smoke which can be breathed in and become irritating to your lungs.",
        "To counteract this, put on a fan if you're working in an enclosed area.",
        "Put a wood finisher on your project when you are done.",
        "The last step is to put a wood finisher on your product.",
        "Let this dry thoroughly before your wood burning project is completely finished."
