Look for frozen fillets that are tightly packaged. Make sure there's no visible ice or blood. Store frozen sole fillets in the freezer for up to 3 months. Dry the fillets gently with a paper towel. Excess moisture on the fish can cause the flour coating to clump up. Before you coat the sole fillets with flour, gently pat both sides of each fillet with a paper towel.

Choose a plate or dish that is large enough to easily accommodate the length of your sole fillets. A large serving platter would work great for this. Season the sole fillets with the kosher salt. Measure out \u00bd teaspoon (2 g) of kosher salt. Working with 1 fillet at a time, sprinkle the salt on each side. Continue doing this until you've seasoned all 4 of the fillets. Coat both sides of each fillet with the flour. Place 1 fillet flat on the flour-covered plate. Pick the fillet up and lay it down on the other side. Shake the fillet gently to remove any excess flour. Place the flour-coated fillets on a clean plate and set them aside for now. Melt 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter in a large skillet.
