        "As soon as you spot a snake that you think might be poisonous, stop moving and avoid coming any closer.",

        "If you\u2019re standing close, the snake might interpret this as an act of aggression.",

        "If you happen to step directly on a snake or wander a little too close, don't panic.",
        "Just take a few steps back in a calm, unhurried manner and put as much distance as you can between you and the snake.",
