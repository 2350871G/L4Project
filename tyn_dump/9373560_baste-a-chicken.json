It\u2019s best to roast your bird in a roasting pan rather than on a baking sheet, since its juices may spill onto the floor of the oven. If your recipe calls for roasting vegetables in the same pan as the chicken, roast them in a separate pan so they don\u2019t get overcooked by the basting liquid. Chickens will typically take 20 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) plus an additional 15 minutes of total roasting time to cook through.
