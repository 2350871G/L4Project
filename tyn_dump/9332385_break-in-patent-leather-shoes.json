Since patent leather is stiff and unforgiving, you're not going to be able to change the fit very much \u2013 maybe a quarter of a shoe size, at most. Have yourself fitted for shoes in the store, and try on a few pairs before you buy. Look out for the following when you try on patent leather shoes:\nMake sure that your toes do not feel squeezed or crushed. Pick a shoe that is comfortable in the heel. The back of the shoe should not rub your heel or slip off when you walk. Make note of how the shoe feels around the ball of your foot. This is the widest part of your foot, so look for a shoe that allows the ball of your foot to sit comfortably. Test out the shoes with the kind of socks you would normally wear with those shoes. Make sure they fit comfortably with your usual socks."

Buy your patent leather shoes in advance of when you plan to wear them, and spend a few days wearing them for short periods at home or at work. Start by wearing them for 10 minutes at a time, and then increase your wear time by another 10 minutes. Keep doing this over several days until you are comfortable wearing (and walking around in) the shoes for a full hour. The total break-in time will depend on a lot of factors, including what kind of material the sole is made of and how well the shoes fit to begin with. Your shoes may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to feel comfortable. Shoes with leather soles take longer to break in than shoes with rubber soles. The first time you wear your shoes out, try to keep your wear time to no more than 2-3 hours."
