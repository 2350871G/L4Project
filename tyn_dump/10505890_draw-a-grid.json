You may want cells that are uniform in size or variable in size. That all depends on how you want your grid to look. This example will use square, uniform cells. You can alter this method to be used in any type of grid you want to make."

Do your homework on the measurements, and know the size of the paper you are working with. Ensure that the size of your squares divides evenly into the size of the paper, or you will have squares that won't fit evenly into it."
