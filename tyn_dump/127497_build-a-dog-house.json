Pay attention to these factors when building a dog house:\nThink about insulation. Remember that the base builds the foundation for the whole house and creates a space of air between the ground and the floor that acts as insulation for the house. A house without a base is cooler during the cold months and warmer during the hot months. Consider the specific elements that might affect the base in your outdoor environment. If it rains often in your area, make sure to use a non-toxic, water-resistant material and build the base high enough off of the ground to prevent flooding."

If it rains often in your area, make sure to use a non-toxic, water-resistant material and build the base high enough off of the ground to prevent flooding. Use a framing square and a pencil to begin reproducing the diagram you created on the wood itself. Cut 2x4 wood boards into four pieces, with two at 22-1/2\" long and two at 23\" long for a medium-sized dog. Place the 23\u201d side pieces inside the 22-1/2\u201d front and back pieces to create a rectangle with the 2\" side resting on the ground. Use a countersink drill bit to pre-drill pilot holes. Then attach the base pieces together using two 3\u201d galvanized wood screws in each end. Transfer the floor plans by using a pencil and a framing square to a single sheet of 3/4\" plywood. The dimensions are 26\" by 22-1/2\" for the above sized frame. Using 1-1/4\u201d galvanized wood screws, attach the floor panel to the base by drilling one screw into each corner of the of the base.

Each side should be 26\" long and 16\" wide, while the front and back should be a 24\" by 16\" rectangle with an attached 12\" high and 24\" wide triangle on top of the rectangle. Cut out this shape in one piece for both the front and the back of the house. Leave an opening on the front wall of the house about 10\" wide and 13\" high. Leave a 3\" tall space at the bottom of the opening to cover the base. To create the round arch at the top of the opening, use any round object you have handy, such as a mixing bowl. Cut out eight pieces of framing. Using a piece of 2x2 fir or cedar wood, cut out eight pieces to use as framing to secure the walls and roof. You will need four corner framing pieces 15\u201d long and four roof framing pieces 13\u201d long. Fasten one 15\u201d corner framing piece to each edge of the side frames using three 1-1/4\u201d galvanized wood screws. Then place the side panels on the base and screw galvanized wood screws every 4\u20135 inches (10.2\u201312.7 cm) around the perimeter. Attach the front and back panels. Place the front and back panels on the floor base and attach to the framing with galvanized wood screws every 4\u20135 inches (10.2\u201312.7 cm) around the perimeter. Building a Roof Try building a triangular, sloping roof. This not only allows rain and snow to slide off of the dog house, but also gives your dog more room to stretch out in his humble abode. Draw the plans for the roof panels on the 2x2 piece of wood, with the dimensions at 32\" long and 20\" wide. These pieces will rest on top of the side panels to form a triangular sloping roof. Attach the 13\u201d 2x2 roof framing piece to the inside edges of the front and back panels, halfway between the top and bottom of the angled side of each panel. Screw three 1-1/4\u201d galvanized wood screws into each panel. Place the roof panels on top of the sides, making sure that the peak is tight and panels hang over each side. Secure the roof panels to the framing pieces using 1-1/4\u201d galvanized wood screws at 3\" intervals. Customizing Your Dog House Personalize your dog house with paint. Using only non-toxic paints that won't harm your dog, you can paint the outside of the house to match your own, or pick a fun theme like an underwater scene. If you have small children, it can be fun to allow them to paint the dog house as an art project. Create a sturdier roof.
