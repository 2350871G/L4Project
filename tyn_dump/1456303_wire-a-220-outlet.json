If you need to cut through concrete or brick, use a drill with a masonry bit so you don\u2019t cause any damage to the tool or chip the wall. Install electrical conduit between the breaker box and the hole you drilled. Wires for 220 lines cannot be exposed outside of your walls since they could easily get damaged, which could cause serious injury or death. Get enough rigid metal conduit to run from the side of the breaker box to the hole you cut and attach it to your wall using conduit straps every 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm). If the 220 line goes through the floor, then you must also install conduit through the floor. You don\u2019t have to run conduit in your walls.

If you can\u2019t get a wire stripper to take off the cable\u2019s coating, carefully cut through it with a utility knife and peel the coating back to expose the wires. Strip \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of insulation off the ends of each wire. Work on 1 wire at a time or else you won\u2019t remove the insulation as well. Grip the last \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of the wire in the jaws of the wire stripper and squeeze the handles together. Pull the wire stripper toward the end of the wire to cut off the insulation. Repeat the process for the other 3 wires that were inside the cable. Feed the white wire into the slot with the neutral screw on the outlet.

Look for the grounding screw labeled \u201cGreen\u201d or \u201cGround\u201d directly across from the neutral screw. Put the green wire into the port next to the grounding screw and tighten it with a screwdriver so it doesn\u2019t move around or fall out. Pull on the green wire to make sure it doesn\u2019t slip out from the outlet. The screw may also be on a metal grounding strap rather that extends out from the back of the outlet.Tip: The ground wire inside the cable may be uninsulated rather than green. Put the uninsulated wire on the grounding screw instead. Put the black and red wires into the hot ports on the back of the outlet. There will be 2 unlabeled screws left on the back of the outlet, which are known as the hot screws. Place the end of the black wire in the port next to one of the unlabeled screws, and the red wire in the port on the other. Tighten the screws with a screwdriver to clamp the wires in place so they can\u2019t fall out. It doesn\u2019t matter which unlabeled screw the red or black wire is attached to since they both will carry the same current to the outlet. Push the wires and outlet into the box so you can screw it in place. Bend the wires so they can fit in the back of the box. Push the outlet in front of the wires so the screw holes on the outlet line up with the ones along the sides of the box. Use a screwdriver to secure the outlet in place so it doesn\u2019t come free. Screw a wall plate over the outlet to hide the inside of the outlet box and wires. When you need to access the wires, unscrew the wall plate so you can get to them. Connecting the Breakers to Power Strip the insulation from the 10/4 cable and the wires that will connect to the circuit breaker. Grip the last 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm) of the 10/4 cable between the jaws of a wire stripper and pull them toward the end to cut off the coating. Clamp the stripper \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) from the ends of each wire from inside the cable and remove the insulation around them. Work on 1 wire at a time so you don\u2019t accidentally damage them. Use a utility knife to cut through the coating on the 10/4 cable if you can\u2019t remove it with your wire strippers. Remove the safety panel from the front of the box. The safety panel on your circuit breaker box is the cover that hides all of the wires and breakers inside. Locate the screws around the edges of the circuit breaker box and rotate them counterclockwise to loosen them from place. Set the panel aside while you\u2019re working so it\u2019s out of the way. Never remove the safety panel cover while the power is still on. This could cause to get electrocuted. Take out the circular knockout on the side or top of the circuit breaker box. Inspect the sides or top of the circuit breaker box to look for a circular piece that has a precut edge around it, also known as the knockout. Position the end of a screwdriver in the middle of the circle, and tap on the screwdriver\u2019s handle with a hammer to punch the knockout out from the side. You can use a hole in the side of your circuit breaker box that already has wires running through it if there\u2019s room for your cable. You may have to drill through the circuit breaker box if there aren\u2019t any more knockouts you can use. Be sure to use a drill bit meant for metal. Put a cable clamp in the hole you just knocked out. A cable clamp is a small cylindrical shape with metal bars on top to protect cables and hold them so they don\u2019t slip. Get a cable clamp that matches the size of the knockout on your circuit breaker box, and slide the clamp through the hole. Screw the locking nut onto the threaded end of the clamp to hold it securely against the box. You can buy cable clamps from your local hardware store. Feed the wires from the cable through the clamp into the box. Push the 4 wires from the 10/4 line between the bars on top of the cable clamp so they go inside the circuit breaker box. Pull the wires into the box completely so you have 1\u20132 feet (30\u201361 cm) of wire to work with. Once the wires are inside, tighten the screws on the top bars of the clamp so the wires don\u2019t move around. Don\u2019t feed any part of the 10/4 cable that still has the outer coating since it won\u2019t hold the wires as securely. You can always loosen the clamp if you need to pull more wire into the circuit breaker box if it wasn\u2019t initially long enough. Install a 30-amp double-pole breaker on the circuit. A double-pole breaker allows twice the power to run through it as a standard 15-amp single pole breaker, and takes up the same space as 2 single-pole breakers. Find a spot along the line of other breakers where the double-pole breaker will fit. Push in the top of the breaker into the metal clips inside the box so it snaps into place before pushing the bottom into place. You can buy double-pole breakers from your local hardware store. Make sure you get a breaker that matches the circuit breaker box brand you have. Make sure the breaker is off before you install it. Different brands of breakers snap into place in various ways, so check the instructions before you install it so you don\u2019t accidentally damage them. Push the ends of the red and black wires in both ports of the breaker. Once you have it in place, locate the 2 ports in the bottom of the breaker where you\u2019ll connect the power. Take the ends of the black and red wires and feed one of them into each of the ports. Tighten the screws on the bottom of the breaker with a screwdriver to hold the wires in place. It doesn\u2019t matter which ports the black and red wires go into since they\u2019re both transferring power to the outlet. Wrap the green and white wires around the screws on the grounding bar. Look on the inside walls of the circuit breaker box to find a bar with multiple screws and wires attached to it, which is the grounding bar. Bend the ends of the green and white wires into hooks and wrap them around separate screws along the bar. Tighten the screws so the wires don\u2019t move or shift around. Don\u2019t wrap the wires around screws that already have other wires around them since you could short out the power or cause a current to travel to a different appliance.Variation: If there are 2 bars on the walls of your circuit breaker box, one of them will be for neutral wires and the other will be for ground wires. Check the color of the other wires attached to the bars to determine where to place your neutral and ground wires. Knock out the slots on the circuit breaker box\u2019s safety cover that line up with the breaker. Hold the safety panel up to the circuit breaker box so you can find where the new breaker lines up with it. Place the end on your screwdriver over the slots where the breaker would go, and tap the end with a hammer to punch it out. Pull off the piece of the safety panel you punched out so the breaker fits easily. You don\u2019t have to punch out any slots if the breaker already lines up with an existing hole in the panel. Screw the cover back on the circuit breaker box before turning it on. Hold the panel back up against your circuit breaker box and reattach the screws with a screwdriver. Make sure the safety panel sits tightly on the front of the box and that none of the wires are exposed. Once you finish, turn the main power back on the circuit breaker box so you can use your outlet.",
