The fan is connected with a single cable, so be careful not to pull too hard. Pull the fan's cable free from the motherboard. Grab the part of the cable closest to the motherboard and gently pull the connector upwards from its slot. Remove the Wi-Fi antennae (optional). If you need to replace the Wi-Fi assembly, you can do so now. Here's how:\nUse the same screwdriver to remove the screw(s) that connect the small black plastic panel to the case, and then gently pull it away to expose more of the motherboard. Unscrew all 4 screws (they are different sizes, so keep track of which goes where) from the top and bottom of the grated metal plate (which is part of the antenna). Gently pull the grated plate away from the case. Don't pull too hard, as the plate is connected with a cable. Gently pry the antennae connector away from the motherboard. The connector is quite small, so if you have a spudger or small plastic wedge, use that. Be careful not to remove the socket to which the connector is attached. Disconnect all cables from the motherboard. Again, a spudger or a small plastic wedge would work best for disconnecting these cables. It is extremely important that you remove all cables if you plan to remove the logic board or you could break a connector. 2009 and Earlier Mac Mini Shut down and remove all cables from the Mac Mini. In addition to the power cord, you'll want to unplug any other cables attached to the system. When you are ready to begin working, touch a piece of metal to discharge any static electricity from your body. Make sure that you are working in a relatively dust-free environment, as even small amounts of dust can damage the computer's delicate electronic components. Place the Mac Mini face-down on a clean cloth. Place a clean cloth on top of a clean, flat work surface. The cloth will help prevent any scratches to the computer's body. Pry the round plastic plate away from the base. Slide the blade of a spudger or thin, flexible putty knife into the gap between the metal shell and plastic base of the computer. Once the blade is partially inserted, apply light outward pressure to the putty knife to pry the shell away from the base. You will hear some clicking sounds as the plastic latches disengage. Remove the computer's interior from the aluminum shell. Once the base has been loosened from the shell, place your thumbs on the side of the computer with the ports. Apply gentle upward pressure to disengage the last latches, and carefully lift the entire interior assembly out of the metal shell. Set the shell aside, and place the interior gently onto the cloth. Disconnect the 3 connections between the upper and lower interior assembly. The interior of the Mac Mini consists of 2 main pieces, which are connected in 3 places. Here's how to disconnect those pieces:\nFirst, remove the Airport wireless antenna. This is a pentagonal-shaped plastic piece that sits against the corner of the optical drive. To remove it, place your pointer finger on top of it to steady it, and pinch the tubular base between your thumb and middle finger. Apply gentle pressure to the base and lift the antenna up and out of the assembly. Next, remove the hard drive sensor cable. This cable is made from 2 small black wires, and is located on the same side of the assembly as the optical drive opening. To disconnect it, grab the small gray plug at the end of the wires and pull it gently from its port. Do not attempt to remove the plug by pulling the wires themselves. Finally, disconnect the flexible cable running between the audio board and the interconnect board. This cable is located on the side of the computer with the external ports, and looks like a wide, thin orange band. To disconnect it, pinch it between your fingers on the side nearest to the optical drive, and pull it out. Unscrew the 4 screws connecting the 2 parts of the internal assembly. In each corner of the internal frame, there is a small screw attaching the 2 pieces together. Use a # 0 Phillips-head screwdriver to remove these screws. Note that 1 screw is longer than the others. Lift the 2 assembly pieces apart. Once the cables and screws have been removed, lift the 2 pieces of the internal assembly apart. Your Mac Mini's internal components are now fully exposed. Make the necessary changes and reassemble the computer by retracing the process above.",
