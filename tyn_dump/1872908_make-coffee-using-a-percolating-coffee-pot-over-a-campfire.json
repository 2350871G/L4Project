                    "description": "Gather the wood you\u2019ll be using for the fire and stack or bundle it together. The simplest way to build a campfire is to use the \"teepee\" method, standing multiple smaller sticks upright and leaning them together so that they meet at the top. Scatter your tinder (fire-starting materials that are easily ignited, such as dry grass, bark or cotton balls) in the center of the teepee around the base. Leave a small space in the center for oxygen to flow through. Dry wood chopped or broken into small sections will burn best. It isn\u2019t necessary to build a large fire. 3 or 4 decent sized logs (along with plenty of kindling) should be enough to heat the percolator."

Keep the flames stoked by adding bits of kindling (smaller twigs, leaves and other dry brush) periodically. As the fire grows hotter, you can begin piling on more wood. Construct your fire somewhere with adequate coverage, protected from wind and precipitation. It may help to dig a shallow pit in which to place the firewood. Avoid putting wet wood or fresh foliage into the fire. These things don't burn easily, and will often produce thick, choking smoke."

Brewing coffee with a percolator will be easiest when the fire has died down a bit and the percolator can rest directly on the hot coals. Coals put off a lot of heat without flames, and are therefore easier to cook with than an open fire. If you don\u2019t feel like waiting, you can use a fresh fire. Just set the percolator down low next to the base, or hang it directly over the flames if you\u2019re able."

Dig a shallow pit, ring it with large stones and scatter a couple handfuls of coal inside. Light the coals and let the temperature build until they\u2019re glowing. Coal is convenient when it comes to this type of preparation, but may be less practical to pack and transport. Cooking with bagged charcoal can be made easier with the use of a campfire cooking stove, dutch oven or similar implement."

You can also set the percolator off to one side of the heat source if the flames are still raging or you\u2019ve got other items cooking, though it may take a while for the percolator to get hot enough to brew the coffee with indirect heat. Rotating it partway through the heating process can help speed things along. Be sure to construct the fire on level terrain so that the percolator has a flat surface to rest on. Keep all other gear and supplies away from both the fire and percolator."
