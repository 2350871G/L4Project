        "Drizzle each fish with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of olive oil.",
        "Loosely fold the foil.",
        "Grab the edges of the foil and fold them over the fish, crimping them together tightly to form a packet.",
        "Make sure that the trout is centered in the middle of the square before folding the square up.",
        "Place the packets on a baking sheet.",
        "Bake 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "When done, the flesh of the trout should be opaque.",
        "It should also flake easily when pierced with a fork.",

        "Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.",
        "Choose a baking sheet with a shallow rim.",
        "Note that steelhead trout are generally quite large, so you should use a large baking sheet instead of a small one.",
        "Melt the butter in a saucepan.",
        "Add the butter to a saucepan or small skillet and heat it over medium heat until it melts and begins to sizzle.",
        "Cook the shallot, garlic, and lemon zest.",

        "Cook for an additional minute.",
        "If using pre-minced garlic, use roughly 1 tsp (5 ml).",

        "Place the fish on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle it with a little salt and pepper.",
        "If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to start with, try 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) pepper.",
        "If the fish is too large to fit across the length of the baking sheet, turn it and let it lay across the sheet diagonally.",
        "Note that steelhead trout has a taste somewhat comparable to salmon, and the two are often used as substitutes for one another.",
        "Steelhead trout tends to be slightly thinner, though, so it requires a shorter cooking time than salmon.",
        "Drizzle with prepared butter mixture.",
        "Spoon the flavored butter mixture over the trout, coating it evenly and completely.",
        "Sprinkle with minced dill.",
        "Use half of your minced dill to season the fish before it cooks.",

        "Let the oil warm up over medium heat as you prepare the fish.",
        "Pan-frying is a popular way to cook lake trout.",
        "Other common cooking methods include smoking and grilling.",
        "Lake trout can be baked, as well, but that method is not quite as typical for lake trout.",
        "Combine the cheese, crackers, cornmeal, garlic salt, and black pepper.",
        "Mix these five ingredients in a shallow bowl or dish until thoroughly combined.",
        "For a smokier taste, you could used bacon-flavored crackers instead of standard saltine crackers.",

        "Mix the eggs and milk.",
        "Beat the eggs and milk in another shallow bowl with a whisk.",
        "In order to serve as an effective egg wash, the eggs and milk must be combined well.",
        "The sides of the dish must be high enough to prevent the egg wash from dripping out.",
        "The bowl should have a wide mouth, though, so that it is easy enough for you to dunk the fish in it.",
        "Coat the fish in the egg wash. Dunk each fish fillet into the egg mixture.",
        "Hold the fillet over the bowl of egg wash for 30 seconds or so.",
        "Let the excess egg drip off.",
        "If the fillets feel slimy or sticky, rinse them in cold water and pat dry with clean paper towels before dunking them in the egg wash. Dredge in the crumb mixture.",
        "After coating all sides of the lake trout in egg, roll the fish in the crumb mixture to coat all sides.",
        "Each fillet must be rolled in the crumb mixture gently.",
        "Otherwise, it could break apart.",
        "Lightly shake each fillet over the bowl of crumbs once you coat it.",
        "The excess crumbs should fall off.",
        "Fry for 5 to 7 minutes.",

        "Fry until crispy and opaque on all sides.",
        "Turn the fish once during the cooking process using a spatula.",

        "Pour the oil into a large skillet and warm it up using medium heat.",
        "Canola oil works well, but you can also use sunflower oil or safflower oil.",
        "All three are good choices because they contribute very little additional taste and have a high smoke point.",
        "Give the oil 1 or 2 minutes to become hot before pressing forward.",
        "Add the butter.",
        "After the oil becomes notably glossy, add the butter to the pan.",
        "Once it begins to sizzle, stir it into the hot oil already coating the pan.",
        "Let the butter melt completely before moving to the next step.",
        "You could also use margarine instead of butter, but butter will have a richer taste.",
        "Season the fish with salt and pepper.",
        "Sprinkle a small amount of salt and pepper over both sides of each fish.",
        "A little will go a long way.",
        "Brook trout has a slightly more delicate flavor than other types of trout, so many prefer to cook the trout in a way that brings out the flavor of the fish without adding many competing flavors.",
        "For that reason, you should avoid using too many herbs or spices when seasoning brook trout.",
        "Use brook trout that has been cleaned, dried, and boned.",
        "You can remove the heads and tails or keep them on.",
        "Additionally, you can keep the scales and skin on, since the skin can be crispy and flavorful, especially when pan-fried.",
        "Cook the trout for 4 to 6 minutes.",
        "Once the trout turns light brown on the bottom side, carefully turn it over with a spatula and continue cooking on the other side.",
        "Each side should only cook for 2 to 3 minutes.",
