Once you\u2019ve found people to play with, have everyone sit in a circle at a table or on the floor so you\u2019re all facing each other. Deal out 3 cards face down to each player. These 3 cards will make up each player\u2019s hand. Make sure the cards are face down so that no one knows what cards everyone has. You can use a regular 52-card deck of playing cards. You don't need a special deck of cards to play Thirty One. Place the deck face down in the center and flip the top card up next to it. The remainder of the deck that\u2019s face-down in the middle of the playing area will be the draw pile. The face-up card next to it will be the discard pile. Make sure all of the players can reach the 2 piles since everyone will need to use them during the game. Give each player 3 tokens to start with. You can use anything as tokens, like poker chips, coins, or game pieces. These tokens will be used later in the game to determine which players get to stay in for another round and which ones are out. Have each player place their tokens in front of them on the table or floor so everyone can see them. Learning the Basics Try to be the last player with a token left to win the game.

Once you lose all 3 of your tokens, you\u2019re out of the game, so try not to be the losing player at the end of each round. Learn the card values so you can tally your score. Every card has a value in Thirty One, and you\u2019ll use those values to figure out who has the lowest score at the end of each round. The card values are:\nCards 2-10: scored at face value. For example, a 3 card would be worth 3 points. Jacks, Queens, Kings: 10 points\nAces: 11 points Choose 1 suit to count toward your score at the end of each round. Instead of adding up the value for all of the cards in your hand at the end of a round, you\u2019ll choose 1 suit\u2014hearts, spades, clubs, or diamonds\u2014and only count the cards in that suit.

Playing the Rounds Start with the player to the left of the dealer. If you\u2019re not that player, wait until it\u2019s your turn to play. Play moves clockwise, and the dealer will go after everyone else has played. You don't need to wait until it's your turn to pick up the 3 cards you were dealt. You can pick them up right away and start strategizing while you wait for your turn! Draw from the deck or the discard pile on your turn.

        "Since knocking triggers the end of a round, you usually don't want to knock unless you are satisfied with the cards in your hand and you think you have a high score.",
        "You can knock by saying \"Knock\" or knocking on the table.",
        "If you knock on your turn, you don't have to discard since you're not picking any cards up.",
        "If you're dealt a good hand to start with, you can knock on your first turn or early on in the game so the rest of the players don't have as many chances to draw the cards they need.",
        "Pass on your turn if you don\u2019t want to pick up after someone has knocked.",
        "You aren\u2019t allowed to skip your turn in Thirty One, unless it\u2019s after someone has knocked.",
        "In that case, if you\u2019re satisfied with your hand and you think you have a high score, you can say \u201cpass.\u201d\nKeep in mind that if you pass you won't get any more chances to draw or discard before the round is over.",
        "End the round after someone knocks and everyone has had their last turn.",
        "A round can\u2019t end until someone knocks.",
        "Once they do, the rest of the players get one more turn and then the round is over.",
        "At the end of a round, all of the players can reveal the 3 cards in their hand.",
        "Tally your scores for the round and take a token from the lowest scorer.",
        "Each player should choose their suit for that round, add up their total score, and announce it to the other players.",
        "Whoever has the lowest score gives up one of their tokens\u2014if it happens to be their last token, they\u2019re out of the game!",
        "If 2 or more players are tied for the lowest score, then the player with the highest card in the suit they chose wins.",
        "If the player that knocked for that round is the one with the lowest score, they must give up 2 tokens instead of 1.",
        "Continue playing rounds until only 1 player is left with a token.",
        "To start a new round, shuffle all of the cards and deal them out just like you did when you started the game.",
        "Keep taking a token from the losing player at the end of each round until eventually 1 player is left standing!",
        "If you\u2019re playing with a large group of people and the game is taking a long time, try playing with 2 tokens instead."
