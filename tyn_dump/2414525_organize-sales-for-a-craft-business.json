Choose your fairs carefully based on the other crafts available, the cost of a booth, the timing and the clientele. Going to every market in your area is likely to leave you with disappointing sales. Ask a popular craft seller to sell your crafts on their website or at their store. This outlet may ask for a portion of the profits. If so, keep track of that percentage on all sales so that you will have accurate bookkeeping. Sell on eBay and Craigslist. You can post and sell for almost no cost. However, remember that all income from these sales must be reported to the tax authorities as income. Sell customized versions of your products in bulk to companies, schools and organizations. You will have to develop wholesale contracts and workout the profit margin you would like from selling in bulk with a discount."
