Once you've decided on the shape of your guitar, sketch it out on a sheet of poster paper. Cut the guitar out once you\u2019re done. This will be your template, so make sure that it\u2019s the same size you want your cake to be. Don\u2019t worry about the details on the guitar, such as the sound hole, tuning pegs, and strings. Focus just on the outline. Bake a sheet cake large enough to fit the body of the guitar.

Place the template so that you'll have enough scraps to use for the neck and head. Cut around the template, then remove the scraps. Hold the template down with 1 hand while you use the other to cut around it. Remove the scraps so that you have just the body of the guitar left. Peel the template off as well. If you made 2 sheet cakes for a taller cake, do this step twice, once for each cake layer. Cut the rest of the cake to create the neck and head. Depending on how much scrap cake you have leftover, you may need to cut the neck and head in several parts, which is fine. Just work with what you have and try your best. Eat the rest of the scraps or save them to make cake pops! Repeat this step if you made 2 sheet cakes for a taller guitar cake. Filling and Frosting the Cake Slice the cake in half using a long knife, a cake slicer, or thread. Place your hand on top of the cake to hold it steady.
