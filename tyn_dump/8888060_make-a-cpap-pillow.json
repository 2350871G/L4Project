    "text": " Tying a Standard Pillow Purchase a firm pillow. You can buy an inexpensive firm pillow from your local department or home goods store. If you don\u2019t want to purchase a new pillow, you can just use an old one you already own. A firm pillow will work best since it\u2019ll hold its shape better than a plush one. Tie it two-thirds down from one end. Grab an old dress tie and use it to tie off the pillow to create indentations for the CPAP mask. Tie the pillow tightly two-thirds from one end. A dress tie is more durable and will feel better to lie on than string, twine, or rope. If you don't have a dress tie, try using a soft ribbon or narrow strip of fabric.

Try lying down on your side on the one-third section of the pillow. The tie should create spaces that comfortably fit your CPAP mask. If necessary, adjust the tie\u2019s location to find the most comfortable position. Cutting a Foam Pillow Lie on a foam pillow and mark where your CPAP mask lies. Purchase an inexpensive foam pillow. Lie on each side with your mask on, and measure where the mask makes contact with both sides of the pillow. Trace out the areas that you\u2019ll need to cut out to make room for the mask. Be careful not to accidentally mark your mask. Carve C-shaped cutouts for the mask on each side. Use a long serrated knife or electric carving knife to cut the pillow. Carve along the marks you traced on each side. Carving cutouts for the mask on each side will allow you to comfortably sleep on both your right and left sides.
