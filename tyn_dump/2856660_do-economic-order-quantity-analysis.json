If not, I'm not sure why not, so check through the logic of all this. For one thing, the annual usage or sales could be quite different and we have not changed that variable name everywhere it occurs. And the carrying costs would be higher, given profit expectations in a special order situation.

The new ways of doing business work better and are vastly more profitable. Lastly change the last line of the note in cell B36 to read the ERS is the Economic Run Size. and change cell I37 to read ERS an = and then without quotes \"SQRT(2ASetupCosts/S)}}\". If deciding to make a new chart, make sure the title reads Economic Run Size instead of EOQ. Modern Business Considerations \"Incidentally, in various machine shops, the high cost of setup time has historically been a critical factor that tends to boost the size of production runs and the optimal size of inventory. The increasing use of automated machine tools, which are set up and controlled by computer programs, has reduced setup time enormously. It is now much easier to switch from the production of one item to another. This phenomenon has led toward lower production runs and lower optimal inventory sizes. \"(1) Basic Assumptions of the EOQ Model: ",
