Once you have purchased your tile, arrange it on your existing countertop to see what it will look like in the end. Confirm that this is the design you wish to go with before you begin. If you are having any of your tiles precut at the store to line the edges, make sure their sizes are correct.

    "text": " Painting Your Countertop Decide on a look. Instead of replacing your countertop with costly granite, marble, or stainless steel, save yourself some money and simply purchase paints that are specifically designed to resemble those materials. Or, just use whatever color suits your fancy. Be sure to choose a paint that is specifically meant for laminate countertops, since these are often cheaper than other paints and won\u2019t require you to prime. Measure your countertop. Make sure you buy enough paint for the job. Measure the dimensions of all surface area to be covered. Be sure to buy enough for two coats to ensure the countertop\u2019s original surface doesn\u2019t bleed through once the paint dries. Search online for \u201cpaint calculators,\u201d to get a ballpark figure on how much to buy. Plan wisely. Refer to your brand of paint's instructions regarding drying times. Expect some brands to take as many as three days for all coats to fully air-dry. Also be aware that the paint\u2019s consistency made be adversely affected by extreme weather. Plan accordingly, with a guaranteed stretch of consistently ideal weather for as long as the paint needs to dry. Protect other surfaces. Line all other surfaces that connect with the countertop (such as walls and cabinets) with painter\u2019s tape where they meet. Remove or cover appliances like sinks and stoves. Use painter\u2019s tape to secure a tarp, dropcloth, sheet, or other protective covering over the floor. Protect yourself. Expect paints to be toxic. Minimize the amount of contact that you will have with the paint itself or its fumes. Set up fans to promote better air circulation. Wear protective gear, such as a respirator, gloves, foam collars, long sleeves and pants. Sand the countertops. Use a fine sanding block to smooth the surface. Scrape away any substances that may have dried, congealed, or otherwise stuck to them. Create as smooth a surface as possible for an even finish. Stir the paint and pour. Expect the paint\u2019s ingredients to separate from each other after sitting on the shelf for so long. Once you open it, stir the contents until the color is even. Then pour some into your paint tray. Apply your first coat. Use a high-density, high-quality foam roller to cover large surface areas. Use brushes to coat smaller and/or harder-to-reach areas, like corners and edges, to avoid making a mess. Have paper towels and water handy so you can quickly clean up any drips on unwanted surfaces before the paint has a chance to dry. Let the first coat dry, then repeat. Refer to your paint\u2019s direction to find out how long it needs on average to fully air dry. Be aware that environmental factors, like low temperatures or high humidity, may make it take longer. Periodically test it by gently touching it to feel how tacky it is. Once it is fully dry, apply a second coat to finish. Resurfacing with a Cement Finish Protect neighboring surfaces. Line the edges of any other surfaces (such as walls, cabinets, and backsplashes) with painter\u2019s tape wherever they meet the countertop. Safeguard them against damage when you sand the countertop. Keep them covered so you don\u2019t have to clean any cement off in case you graze them by accident during application. Additionally, consider removing any sinks in order to protect them and to resurface where the sink\u2019s lip covers the countertop. Sand and clean your existing countertop. Use coarse sandpaper for sanding. Don\u2019t worry about making your countertop smooth, since the cement actually does a better job of sticking to irregular surfaces. Once you\u2019re done, wet a washcloth and wipe the countertop down until it is clean, using additional washcloths as needed. Allow the countertop to air-dry once you are finished. Mix your cement. First, read the cement\u2019s directions. Pour the recommended ratio of cement and water into a disposable container. Stir them with a paint stirrer until the mixture is even. Only mix a small amount at a time. Mixing the total amount of cement that you need to complete the project all at once will result in the cement drying before you reach the end of your project. Instead, make small batches of a couple cups\u2019 worth at a time as you go. Apply your first coat. Lather the cement in a thin layer over your countertop. For wide, open areas, use a large drywall trowel to cover the most amount of surface area with less effort. For corners, edges, and any other tight spaces, use putty knives. Once you\u2019re done, give the cement a minimum of 24 hours to dry, and more if needed. Wide putty knives work best for right angles in corners and where the countertop meets the wall. Wipe the needed amount of cement off onto the painter\u2019s tape covering your wall. From there, draw the cement toward you with your putty knife. \u201cPulling\u201d the cement toward you will create a smoother finish than \u201cpushing\u201d it toward the wall will. Use smaller putty knives to cover any rounded edges. This may be the most labor-intensive part of the application. Make sure the existing countertop is covered and smooth the cement out as much as possible. If necessary, use more cement than desired and sand off the excess later, once it dries. Sand, clean, and repeat. Use medium sandpaper to get rid of any noticeably uneven cement. Vacuum the surface area to remove all dust. Then apply another coat of cement. Wait another 24 hours for the cement to dry, and repeat the process for a third coat. When sanding the first and second coats, don\u2019t worry about making the surface perfectly smooth. Simply concentrate on getting rid of any cement that is obviously higher than the surrounding area. When applying new coats of cement, keep an eye out for any areas where the previous coat appears to be thinner than the surrounding area. Apply extra cement here. Sand, sand, sand. Once your final coat has dried, sand your countertop\u2019s new surface down to your desired level of smoothness. This will take some time, so if you are sanding by hand instead of a machine, protect your fingers with a pair of thin work gloves. Start with coarse sandpaper to get the bulk of the word done quicker. Then switch to fine sandpaper for a smoother finish. Be careful if you use a power sander. Depending on how powerful it is, it may do too good of a job and end up stripping more cement than desired off of your countertop. Clean up. Peel your painter\u2019s tape off of all surrounding surfaces. If needed, use your putty knife to chip off any cement that may have sealed it the edge to the countertop. Then vacuum the area to remove all of the dust created by sanding. Seal the cement. Pour some water-based sealer into your paint tray. Use a paint roller to apply the sealer over large surface areas. Use a brush to reach tighter areas like corners and edges. Give it a couple of hours to dry. Then apply two more coats, and you\u2019re done! The liquid sealer is very thin and can easily drip or splash over other surfaces. If you\u2019re worried about making a mess, add a new layer of painter\u2019s tape over connecting surfaces and cover the floor with a tarp, sheet, or newspapers. When purchasing sealer for kitchen countertops, double-check if the sealer is food-safe. If local stores don\u2019t carry any, consider searching for one that is safe for food online. If not, be sure to keep food from coming into direct contact with the countertop. Tiling Your Countertop Design your pattern. Measure the dimensions of your countertop. Be sure to include the dimensions of all surface areas to be tiled, including the edges as well as the countertop\u2019s backsplash if you want to keep it. Bring the dimensions as well as photos of your countertop\u2019s layout to the retailer where you plan to purchase your tile. Ask for their recommendations in choosing which type of tile will work best for your situation. Once you have purchased your tile, arrange it on your existing countertop to see what it will look like in the end. Confirm that this is the design you wish to go with before you begin. If you are having any of your tiles precut at the store to line the edges, make sure their sizes are correct. If you are looking to create a tiled backsplash on the wall behind the countertop, consider removing the countertop\u2019s backsplash with a reciprocating saw. This will create a continuous effect and simplify the project by creating only one right angle to deal with between the wall and countertop. Remove any appliances. Depending on where your countertop is located, remove any sinks, disposal units, stoves, or other appliances. Give yourself as much access as possible to all sides of the countertop. When removing appliances like sinks and stoves, be sure to turn off the water and gas before doing anything else. With water lines, allow any water that may still be in the pipes to empty before starting. Also unscrew the covers of any nearby power outlets if you are doing the walls as well. Square any rounded edges. If the edges to your existing countertop are rounded, trim them so they become squared. First, use a ruler and level to trace a cutting line along each rounded edge. Although designs may vary, tracing your line 3.25 inches (8.26 cm) in from the edge should accommodate most countertops. Then cut rounded edge off with a circular saw. To keep yourself from going off the mark, create a makeshift cutting guide by using clamps to lock your level into place along the cutting line. Sand the surfaces. Be aware that the adhesive you will be using for your tiles works best with porous surfaces. At the same time, expect your laminate countertop to be made of nonporous materials. So, instead of sanding for smoothness, use 50-grit paper to roughen the texture and create an irregular surface with gaps for the adhesive to settle into for a more secure bond. Trace the tiles\u2019 layout. Arrange whole tiles on the countertop. Start from the edge farthest from the wall and then lay them out toward the wall, column by column. Trace the edges of each tile onto the countertop as you go. Then, at the end of each column, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit before you reach the wall or backsplash. Since areas around the sink can be the trickiest, start here to get the tough part over and done with. Along each side of the sink, trace a line on the countertop along the edge of the last whole tile that will fit here. If the layout of your countertop includes any angles other than right angles, do the same thing as you reach each angle. Cut your tiles to fit. For each area where a whole tile won\u2019t fit in the space left at the end of a row or column, place a whole tile over that area. Keep its edge flush along the edge of the counter, sink, or angle, so that it overlaps the last whole tile in that row or column. Place a straightedge over where they meet and trace a cutting line along the tile on top. Then use a wet saw or a tile cutter to cut that tile to size. Once each one is cut, set each tile in its place to make sure it fits. To avoid wasting materials, it\u2019s better to err on the side of not cutting enough on your first try and then trimming off the excess. Apply adhesive. For tiling, be sure to purchase a latex modified thin-set adhesive. Once your outlines have all been made, remove all loose tiles from the countertop. Then use a trowel to spread a thin layer over the surface area. Keep the layer thin enough for the outlines on your countertop to show through the adhesive, since you will be following these as you lay out your tiles. One edge of your trowel should be combed. Once you have spread adhesive over the surface area, run the comb over it in one direction to form grooves in the adhesive. If your countertop was rounded, place \u215b\u201d by 2\u201d shims underneath the tiles that will line the sawed-off edges. Then apply mortar the edge of the countertop to ensure that any uneven gaps are filled. This will keep those tiles firmly in place. Lay your tiles out. Follow your outlines to set your tiles back into place. Move slowly and purposefully to better ensure that you set them exactly into place. As you place each one down, gently push it into the adhesive perpendicular to the combed grooves. For instance, if you combed the adhesive from left to right, push the tile in toward the back of the countertop. After you set each tile down, a tile spacer along each side and corner to create an even line for grout between each pair of tiles. When you reach an area requiring a cut piece of tile, double-check to see if it needs any additional trimming before setting it into place, since the whole tiles may not exactly match your original outline by this time. In areas where appliances have been removed, be careful that no edge pieces project over the original countertop, which may interfere with reinstallation. Once you are done, refer to the adhesive\u2019s directions to find out how long it needs to dry before proceeding. Grout between the tiles. First, pry the spacers out from between each. Then follow the directions to your grout in order to mix it. Once it\u2019s mixed and ready to go, plug all gaps between tiles by packing the grout in with a hard rubber float. Skim any extra off the top and then use your trowel to smooth the surface. Finally, clean the tiles with a wet sponge by:\nWiping each tile in a circular manner, starting from the center of each tile and working your way, to loosen the grout if it has begun to stick. Soaking the sponge again and then wiping the tiles diagonally, being careful to not disturb the grout drying along their sides. Repeating as needed until the surface of each tile is perfectly clean. Weighing Replacement Options Save money with laminate. If you\u2019re replacing your countertop with a limited budget, go with the cheapest option: laminate. Choose from traditional designs or pick one that resembles more expensive materials, like granite and marble. Opt for a textured surface, rather than a flat one, to better conceal any scratches or other wear and tear that may occur over time. Advantages: takes little effort to wash; stands up to abuse (heavy heat, impact, and stains) very well. Disadvantages: seams allow water to penetrate under the surface and damage the composite wood underneath; surface scratches easily, which is irreparable. Popular colors and patterns for laminate include basalt slate, argento romano, and black riftwood. Use wood for a more natural look. Give your counters a touch of warmth with this earth-toned surface. Price-compare the different types of wood available to find one that matches your budget. Advantages: enhances rustic-style homes; easily repairable; can be utilized for food prep; resists stains when varnished. Disadvantages: requires upkeep with regular applications of mineral oil, beeswax, and varnish; easily damaged by heat and moisture; should not be used over a dishwasher or around sinks. Choose between cherry, maple, teak, walnut, and more. Go the fancy route with marble. If budget is no concern, consider this higher-end countertop. Ensure a sense of style with this classic surface that won\u2019t grow out-of-date. Invest in a surface that will match the rest of your kitchen, regardless of its aesthetic. Advantages: takes little effort to wash when sealed; scratches are repairable with polishing. Disadvantages: easy to chip and scratch; requires sealing on a regular basis; susceptible to etching and staining from acidic foods. Check out various colors of marble to see which pattern and veins you like the most. Minimize maintenance with quartz. If you want to be more or less done with your countertop once you install it, go with this long-lasting material. Enjoy a countertop that will requires little to no upkeep and stand up to almost any abuse, with one exception. Its Achilles heels are the corners and edges, which are prone to chipping. To minimize this, opt for rounded edges. Advantages: non-porous; waterproof; antibacterial; stain- and scratch-resistant; requires no sealant; easy to clean. Disadvantages: can be damaged by heat; corners and edges may chip; difficult to repair. Quartz ranges in color from white and gray to pink, green, or blue. Opt for granite for more affordable durability. If quartz is beyond your budget, or if you are frustrated by the its lack of variety in appearance, consider granite instead. Reap the same benefits with only a little more maintenance required. However, expect the same drawbacks: the edges and corners are its weak spot and are difficult to repair. So opt for a rounded edge to minimize the number of hard corners present. Advantages: stain-, heat-, and scratch-resistant and waterproof when sealed. Disadvantages: requires regular sealing. Black is the most popular color of granite, but it\u2019s also available in beige, blue, burgundy, and other colors. Choose solid surfacing for durability and variety. If you want the benefits of quartz and granite but don\u2019t like the aesthetic of stonework, consider this artificial material. Choose from a wider variety of designs. At the same time, save yourself the trouble of regular maintenance. Advantages: waterproof; nonporous; requires no sealant; heat- and impact-resistant. Disadvantages: prone to scratches, but easily repaired with sanding or buffing. Solid-surface countertops can be made to look like marble, quartz, or granite and is available in a wide range of colors.",
