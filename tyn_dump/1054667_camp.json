Only use a few logs at a time so your fire doesn\u2019t get out of control while it\u2019s burning. Make sure you start your fire inside of a pit so it doesn\u2019t spread. Put out your fire completely when you\u2019re finished using it so it doesn\u2019t keep burning while it\u2019s unattended. Finding Fun Activities Go hiking if you want to explore the area where you\u2019re staying. Check if there are any trails nearby that you can hike along so you can surround yourself with nature. Make sure the trails aren\u2019t too long before you leave, or else you may get too exhausted before you can finish them. When you go out for your hike, put on hiking boots so you can get around easily without hurting yourself. Take snacks and water along with you so you don\u2019t get exhausted or dehydrated while you\u2019re out. If you plan on going hiking off of a known trail, then make sure you have a map and a compass so you don\u2019t get lost. Don\u2019t litter or leave anything behind on the trails since it could affect local wildlife. Make s\u2019mores around the campfire for a sweet treat. Break a graham cracker in half and place a piece of chocolate bar on top of one of the pieces. Roast a marshmallow over your campfire until it\u2019s golden brown, or until it feels gooey when you squeeze it. Put the roasted marshmallow on top of the chocolate and set the other half of the graham cracker on top to finish your treat. Try using different types of candy when you make your s'mores for different flavors. For example, use a peanut butter cup instead of a chocolate bar for a sweet and salty taste. Swim in nearby lakes to cool down on a hot day. Check if there are any nearby lakes or beaches that you can go to near your campsite. Make sure they\u2019re open to the public for swimming, or else you may not be able to stay there. Bring a small cooler with you with some food and water so you can enjoy a day on the lake and enjoy time away from your campsite. Be sure to wear sunscreen while you\u2019re swimming so you don\u2019t get any sunburn. Carefully read any warning signs near the lake or beach if there are any. Some campgrounds may have beaches with lifeguards on duty. If there isn\u2019t a lifeguard, make sure you\u2019re a strong swimmer and you stay at a depth where you feel comfortable. Check what activities are available at the campgrounds. Campgrounds may have special activities or amenities that are available to do during the day. Check if they have any rental equipment, such as fishing rods or kayaks, so you can try new experiences and get away from the campsite. You can also look for games or playgrounds if you want to have fun with the entire family while you\u2019re there. Check the map of the campgrounds to see where activities or different sites take place. Some campgrounds may have special events around holidays, such as fireworks for Independence Day.",
