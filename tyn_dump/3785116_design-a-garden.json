        "Decide in advance which perennials will go into each specific bed, as well as where each perennial will be located within that bed.",
        "You can return to your online garden-planning tool to accomplish this task.",
        "Place taller plants at the back of the bed.",
        "You don\u2019t want them shading smaller plants.",
        "Give wider plants more space.",
        "The beds may look too empty while the plant matures, but they will fill out each season.",
        "Intersperse different colors of plants.",
        "You can try a design with every other plant being a different color, or diagonal rows of plants that are the same color.",
        "Plant very small plants along the borders.",
        "Some small perennial plants will also do well against paths.",
        "You may also consider using landscape fabric as a barrier for weeds.",
        "It can be covered with mulch or rocks to keep your garden looking consistent.",
        "Designing Annual Gardens Look for space.",
        "Locate the spaces where you would like to plant some annuals.",
        "(Whereas perennial plants will regrow each year, annuals will only live for one season.)",
        "Annuals will be excellent additions to areas near walkways, fences or yards.",
        "This will allow your adequate space for replanting each year and for weeding.",
        "Choose locations for \u201cbig annuals.\u201d Big annuals\u2014such as sunflowers\u2014will work best along the outer borders of an annual bed.",
        "In additional to sunflowers, try zinnias and cleome.",
        "Choose locations for \u201cmound formers.\u201d These are flowers like marigolds, California poppies and geraniums.",
        "These flowers take up a bit more space, and as such, they will effectively fill out your garden.",
        "Plant several of these plants at once.",
        "The bright colors will create a pleasing pattern.",
        "Choose locations for additional \u201cspiky growers.\u201d Spiky growers include plants like salvia, angelonia, and snapdragons.",
        "These plants \u201cspike up\u201d adding height, variety, and drama to your annual beds.",
        "Choose locations for \u201cleafy plants.\u201d This will include your grasses, perilla, ornamental cabbage, and coleus.",
        "These leafy green annuals will fill out your garden, while adding dimension to your design.",
        "Fill in around the base.",
        "You can fill in around the bases of your flowers with low growing plants.",
        "Good examples include portulaca, sweet alyssum, fan flower, and million bells.",
        "Designing Vegetable Gardens Choose a sunny spot.",
        "Most vegetables need 6-8 hours of sunlight per day, so access to bright sunshine is the first thing to think about when planning your vegetable garden.",
        "Select a location where your veggies can soak up some rays..",
        "Ensure there is water nearby.",
        "After sunlight, water is the next most crucial component to a vegetable garden.",
        "Whether you plan to water by hand or employ an irrigation system, you need to be sure you can regularly and effectively water your garden.",
        "Veggies are notoriously sensitive to drought.",
        "Evaluate your soil.",
        "Test your soil to see what you have in your area.",
        "Plants like vegetables grow better in rich, well-drained soil.",
        "You can add mulch or compost to your soil to bring in more organic matter if necessary.",
        "Make the garden the proper size.",
        "When planning the size of your garden, you will want to be realistic.",
        "If this is your first vegetable garden, it may be wise to start small.",
        "A well-maintained 10 feet (3.0 m) by 10 feet (3.0 m) garden will produce more food than a weed-filled, unkempt 25 feet (7.6 m) by 25 feet (7.6 m) bed.",
        "Choose an area that is flat.",
        "In some cases, you can tear up earth and level it out, but it may need extra leveling in the future as the dirt compresses.",
        "Decide what you\u2019ll grow.",
        "Select the vegetables you want to grow based on which plants are compatible with your region, and which vegetables you would like to eat!",
        "You will also need to decide how much of your garden will be \u201cdirect sow\u201d (seeds planted right into the earth) versus \u201ctransplanted\u201d (plants started somewhere else and then transferred).",
        "Some direct sow plants include beets, carrots, parsnips, peas, and radishes.",
        "Some veggies you are more likely to transplant include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.",
        "Transplants can be purchased (which is more expensive), or started yourself in an indoor location.",
        "Figure out a timeline.",
        "Before you can plant, you\u2019ll need to know the average date of the last spring frost in your region.",
        "You will want to start planting as soon as possible after the risk of frost has passed.",
        "This can be a gamble: you want to achieve the longest growing season possible, but a late frost can damage what you\u2019ve planted.",
        "Based on the projected last frost, you can select a date to begin planting.",
        "You can check with a local nursery or look into a farmer\u2019s almanac to determine the date for your region.",
        "If you are planning to start your own transplants, work backwards from your planting date, and decide when you\u2019ll need to begin growing your transplants.",
        "Sketch out a plan.",
        "Before you begin planting, take some time to plan the locations of your vegetables.",
        "You will want to place taller vegetables in the back and shorter vegetables near the front, so that they don\u2019t compete for sunlight.",
        "Plant in rows, so that you can separate types of plants and create walkways between the rows.",
        "Start with four foot (1.2 meter) rows and two to three foot (60 to 90 cm) pathways between the rows."
