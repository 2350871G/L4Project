Take the shorter, bent end of the tension lever and stick it into the bottom hole in your door lock. The tension lever will hang down the front of your doorknob. You\u2019ll use the lever to maintain tension on the lock as you pick it and as a way to rotate the doorknob once you've picked the lock. Push the lever counterclockwise to apply tension.
