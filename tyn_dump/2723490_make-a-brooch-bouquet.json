Glue the pieces on immediately so that you can still use them. Make Brooch Stems Take a brooch. Close the clasp and secure it with a hot glue gun if necessary. Decide if your brooch will be secure if you wire it through the clasp. Some brooches break or have unsteady clasps. In this case, try to wrap the wire around the front of the clasp itself, between petals or stones. Thread the green floral wire through the clasp or around the front of the brooch.  Pull it through so that the middle of the wire is wrapped around the brooch and the 2 ends are even at the bottom. Use your needle-nosed pliers to wrap wire around delicate brooches. Bend the wire at the top with the pliers, so that it is securely attached to the clasp. Start twisting the 2 wires around each other approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) below the point where the wire and brooch are attached.  Wrap floral tape around the twisted wire. Floral tape can be flimsy, so make sure it overlaps as you curl it around the wire. Press the ends of the floral tape securely so that it sticks well. Repeat the process with each of your brooches.

Wrap the stems with several layers of masking tape, once you have your desired arrangement. Clip the wire stems with the wire cutters, if they are too long. Stick the gathered stems into your bouquet holder or foam noodle, if you are using these items.  Glue 1 end of the ribbon to the very top of your stem bunch, bouquet holder or foam noodle. Use a hot glue gun. Allow the glue to dry well before you begin wrapping the ribbon. Wrap the ribbon in a circular motion around the bouquet. When you get to the bottom, you can wrap the bottom with ribbon vertically and rewrap it horizontally or you can leave the stems showing for 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5cm) Place a strip of super glue at the end of your ribbon.
