    "text": " Making a Simple Necklace Draw your pattern on a sheet of paper. Start with a curved line for the top part of the necklace\u2014use the collar from a shirt or sweater as a template. Draw at least seven, evenly spaced lines radiating downward from the collar. Make the one at the center the longest and the ones at the edges the shortest. Connect them with a series of slightly-curved lines. Go over the lines using a black marker. This will make the pattern more visible in the later steps. Tape a sheet of wax paper over the pattern. The wax paper will make it easier to remove the necklace when you are done. If you don't have any wax paper, you can use parchment paper instead. If you wish to use hot glue, you must use parchment paper. Tape a piece of sheer fabric over the wax paper. Tulle would work best for this, but you can use another sheer fabric, such as chiffon. You want the fabric to be barely visible against your skin or costume. If you wish to use hot glue, you can skip this step, and draw directly on the parchment paper. Trace over the lines with puff paint. You may also find it labeled as \"dimensional fabric paint\". For an extra-spooky effect, use glow-in-the-dark puff paint. You can also use hot glue, but make sure that you are using parchment paper. Wax paper will melt if you use it with hot glue. Add a rhinestone spider, if desired. Glue a large, oval rhinestone and a smaller, round rhinestone to the web. The oval rhinestone will make the body, and the round rhinestone will make the head. Outline both with puff paint, then add eight legs to the oval rhinestone. You can use glow-in-the-dark puff paint or black puff paint for this. Make a simpler spider using puff paint and no rhinestones. Let the puff paint dry completely. This may take several hours to overnight. Refer to the drying times on the label of the product you are using. If you are using hot glue, the drying time will only be a few minutes. Cut the spider web out. Only cut along the outer edges of the spider web. Don't cut out the small spaces inside the web. Glue some ribbon to the back of the necklace so that you can tie it. Cut two long pieces of thin ribbon. Glue the end of each ribbon to each end of your spider web. Be sure to glue the ribbon to the underside, so that the ends won't be visible. You can use hot glue or fabric glue for this. Choose a ribbon color that goes well with your spider web. The thinner ribbon you use for this, the better. If you are using hot glue, you can punch holes to either end of the spider web, and thread the ribbon through them instead. Making Simple Earrings Draw a small spider web on a sheet of paper. Keep the web around 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide. You want it to be small enough to work as a nice set of earrings, but not so small that you can't outline it with hot glue. If you don't know how to draw a spider web, print out an outline of one from the internet. Go over your lines with a black marker to ensure that they are visible. Tape a sheet of parchment paper over the spider web. This will make it easier to remove the spider webs when you are done. Avoid using wax paper. The heat of the glue gun will cause the wax to melt and fuse with the spider webs. Trace over the spider web using a hot glue gun. You can use plain hot glue sticks for this, or you can use colored ones. Black would look great for this. You can also use glitter hot glue sticks for something more sparkly. If you are lucky, you might even be able to find glow-in-the-dark hot glue sticks! Shake some glitter over the spider web before the glue sets, if desired. Black, orange, or purple glitter would work especially well here. Glow-in-the-dark glitter would also work, if you can find it. Be sure to work quickly, however; hot glue sets fast! If you used glitter hot glue, you probably don't need to do this since your web will be already sparkly. Consider painting the spider web once the glue sets. If you used plain hot glue, you can add color to your web by painting it. Give it a coat of spray paint in whatever color you want, then let the paint dry. Glow-in-the-dark paint would look great! Don't paint the spider web if you added glitter to it. The paint would cover the glitter. Pull the web off of the parchment paper once the glue sets. You can tell if the glue is set once it turns hard and opaque. Lift a corner of the web off of the parchment paper, then carefully peel it away. If you used glitter on your web, be sure to put it back into its jar. Twist open a jump ring. Find a small jump ring. Grab one end of it with a pair of needle nose pliers. Grab the other end with your fingers or a second pair of needle nose pliers. Carefully twist the two ends of the jump ring past each other, like opening a door. Do not pull them away from each other. Slip the web and an earring hook onto the jump ring. Find one of the outermost strands on your web, and slip it onto the jump ring. Next, slip an earring hook onto the jump ring. Be sure to use a color that matches the jump ring. If you used a silver jump ring, use a silver earring hook. Close the jump ring. Use the same technique as you did when opening it. Grab one end with a pair of needle nose pliers, and the other end with your fingers or a second pair of pliers. Twist the two ends towards each other, like shutting a door. If there is a small gap in the jump ring, pinch it shut with your finger tips. Repeat the process to make a earring web. If the parchment paper is too dirty to work on, pull it off and tape a fresh sheet down on top. You can make the second earring exactly like the first one, or vary the design a little. Add some details, if desired. At this point, your earrings are done. You can, however, hot glue a little spider charm to each web. This will give the webs that final, spooky touch. Make your own spider. Hot glue an oval rhinestone, then use glitter glue to draw some legs and a head. Hot glue tends to leave behind little strands. You can pull these off, or leave them on for a more web-like feel. Making Wire Earrings or Pendants Measure and cut your wire with a pair of flush wire cutters. Measure and cut three 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) long pieces of 22-gauge wire. Measure and cut a 50-inch (127-centimeter) long piece of 26-gauge wire. You can use any color of wire you want, but black or silver would look best for this project. Wrap the end of the long wire around middle of the three short wires. Hold the three short wires together and find the middle. Place the long wire behind them, a with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long tail sticking out from beneath. Wrap the long wire four times around the bundle. Trim off the tail-end of the long wire with a pair of flush wire cutters. If the stub that's left on the bundle is sharp, carefully press it down using a pair of needle nose pliers. Do not cut off the rest of the long wire. Spread the spokes out evenly. Take the three 22-gauge wires, and spread them out evenly to form a star or \"*\" shape. They may slip and slide through the wrapped wire, so make sure that they are all the same length. Weave the long wire around the spokes for two rounds. Once the spokes are the way you want them, weave the long wire over and under them, like making a basket. Keep doing this until you are back where you started, then repeat for a second round. Push the long wire down into the crevices every so often. Keep the long wire pulled nice and taut. Start wrapping the long wire around each spoke. Bring the long wire under the next spoke and pull it taut. Bring it up, over, and around the spoke. Give it a gentle tug, and push the wrapped part down. Move onto the next spoke. Continue wrapping the long wire around each spoke until you run out. Keep the spokes nice and straight, and the long wire pulled taut. Remember to push the wrapped \"knots\" down to the previous one. If the web starts to warp, pinch it between your thumb and fore finger. Wrap the tail-end of the long wire around the spoke. When the wire is too short to reach the next spoke, you are done weaving. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to wrap it tightly around the current spoke three times. Trim off the tail-end. Use you pair of flush wire cutters for this. You will have long spokes sticking out all around the web. Don't cut these off just yet. Loop the end of the last spoke. Squeeze a pair of wire looping pliers over the last spoke you wrapped, close to the \"knot.\" Pull the tail-end of the spoke down behind the looping wires, towards the center of the web. If you can't find any wire looping pliers, you will need to trim the spokes down, and wrap them using a pair of round nose plies. Wrap and trim tail-end of the loop. Bring the tail-end of the loop towards you, then wrap it around the \"neck\" of the loop. Trim the tail-end off. If you need to, use your needle nose pliers to tuck in any sharp ends. Remove the wire looping pliers when you are done. This wrapped loop will be the top of your earring or pendant. Add an earring hook to the loop. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open up an earring hook. Slide the two ends past each other, not away. Slip the loop onto the hook, then close the hook by pushing the ends back towards each other. If you wish to make a pendant, use a large jump ring instead. Slip the jump ring onto a plain necklace. Loop the other spokes. You do not have to wrap the tail-end around the neck of each loop this time. Simply, make the loop, close it, and trim off the tail. Consider adding a spider charm. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop on the bottom of your earring. Slip a spider charm onto it, then twist the loop back shut. Some charms have big, clunky jump rings. If your charm has one, you might want to remove it first. This will make your earrings look nicer. Use these steps to make a second earring. You can have the second earring match the first one, or you can make it a little different. For example, you can use a different spider charm, or you can skip it altogether.",
