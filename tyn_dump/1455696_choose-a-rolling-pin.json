            "description": "A rod (also known as a French rolling pin) is one piece of wood that is either a straight dowel, tapered from the center, or tapered at the ends. The roller is a round cylinder of wood attached to an internal axle, with two handles at the end to push on to make it roll. Both have a different feel and you may prefer one over the other, or even find that they work well for different tasks in the kitchen. The only way to know is to try one of each style. The rod is easier on your hands and wrists. You place your palm on each end of it and roll using even pressure across the dough. On the downside, your hands touch the dough; some people enjoy this \"dough feel\" as a technique in itself, but touching too much risks heating the dough from your hand warmth, so you need to work quickly. The rod is usually cheaper than a rolling pin and it has another benefit of not having any crevices which could attract random pieces of dough. The rolling pin is used by holding the handles and rolling the cylinder across the dough. The downside is that you need to place more force on the dough and as a result, the dough is not stretched as evenly as with a rod because you're exerting pressure in uneven ways. Some rolling pins are one piece with handles, a cross between both types of rolling pins."

This can be a real hassle, especially if adding a lot of flour makes the pastry over-floured. However, some woods are better than others; look for an oilier wood that will not stick as much. A wooden roll cannot be chilled for pastry that needs to stay really cool. Wooden rolling pins can mark more easily than other types of rolling pins."
