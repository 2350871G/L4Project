If you want a deeper chair, fold the canvas long-ways, making your cuts along the longer edges of the fabric. If you want your chair wider, cut along the short side.

You can also use printed fabric, but be sure it is upholstery weight or outdoor fabric to ensure its strength. Attaching the Seat Drill four holes through the dowel. Mark two holes at each end of the dowel, at 2\u201d and 4\u201d. Then drill through the holes using your 3/8\" bit. Sand the hole to remove any little burrs and clean up the drilling. If you like the natural wood tone, you can leave it or, you can stain the dowel if desired. Knot one end of the rope and guide it through the canvas pocket.

When finished, the knots should be positioned on the dowel. If the two lengths of rope hanging below the dowel are not even, adjust the knots as needed before pulling them tight. Hang the chair. Find the center of the rope above the dowel and tie a knot with 8\u201d to 10\u201d of excess above it. Attach the spring link, and then your quick link to the excess rope above the knot. Screw the hanging hook into a ceiling beam or large tree branch that can support your weight, then hang the link from it.",
