If you do this, be sure to cut vertically through the post-it notes so that there\u2019s some adhesive left on the back.

        "Pull out a sheet of paper and clip it to your divider to hold it in place.",
        "Pull out a sheet from your notebook.",
        "Lay the notebook paper flat on top of the divider so that the sides and corners line up with one another.",
        "Then, use binder clips or paper clips to attach the paper to the divider.",
        "This will hold it in place while you punch your holes.",
        "Use a hole puncher to put matching holes into the divider.",
        "Grab a handheld hole puncher.",
        "Open the jaws and slide them around the paper and the divider.",
        "Hold it over the first hole in the paper.",
        "Close the handles on the hole puncher to drive a hole through the divider at the exact location where the paper\u2019s hole is located.",
        "Continue using the paper as a guide to punch holes in the divider wherever the paper\u2019s holes are located.Tip: You have to use a handheld hole puncher that makes holes one at a time.",
        "You cannot use one of those long hole punchers that adds multiple holes at once since the 3 holes from the longer hole punch don\u2019t line up with the holes in standard notebooks.",
        "If your spiral notebook has dozens of holes in with thin binding, this can be kind of tricky.",
        "Do you best to place each hole you punch at least 0.25 inches (0.64 cm) away from the edge of the paper to avoid tearing the divider.",
        "Take your binder or paper clips off and remove the sheet of paper.",
        "Once you\u2019re done punching your holes, take your paper or binder clips off.",
        "Discard the sheet of paper that you used as a guide.",
        "You now have a divider with holes that match the binding in your notebook.",
        "Slide the divider into the binding if you have a gap in the spirals.",
        "If the spirals that bind your notebook run parallel to one another, there is probably a small gap in the sequence of rings.",
        "Twist the spirals by hand until you find this opening.",
        "Then, slide your homemade divider in between the spirals.",
        "Feed the holes you punched through the spirals so that the divider sits in your notebook like a regular sheet of paper.",
        "Cut slits leading into each hole and slide them over the spirals if they\u2019re closed.",
        "If the spiral binding in your notebook loops from one hole to another, there isn\u2019t a gap for you to slide the divider into the notebook.",
        "Grab a pair of scissors and cut slits running from the edge of the divider into each hole next to it.",
        "Then, set your divider flat on the page where you want your section to start and slide the divider over the spirals using the slits you\u2019ve just cut.",
        "When you make your cuts, you\u2019re basically creating tracks for the divider to slide around the binding.",
        "Since the spirals are thicker than the cuts you make, you may need to pinch them around the spiral binding by hand or with a pencil."
