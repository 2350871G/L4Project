These compost ingredients may attract wild animals if not covered. A well-running pile can POSSIBLY accept them. Avoid adding pet feces to the compost because it could spread disease. Creating Compost Lay twigs, straw, and dry leaves inside of a container. Lay 4 - 8 inches (10.16 - 20.32 cm) of dry leaves twigs and straw on the bottom of a closed container. This carbon-rich material will help aerate the bottom of the compost and help keep it moist. Lay down 4 - 8 inches of nitrogen-rich material. Use organic material like lawn clippings or table scraps and layer it on top of your twigs and leaves. Continue to alternate layers of carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich material. Continue to lay down the dry twigs and green organic material in layers until your compost pile is around 3 feet (91.44 cm) deep. Spray the organic material with water. The compost materials should remain moist so that it breaks down to form compost. Check on your compost daily to make sure that it isn't drying out from the hot sun.
