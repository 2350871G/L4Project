For example, you can outline blue stars with yellow glow-in-the-dark puffy paint. If your socks have thin stripes, draw across every other stripe--or across every 2 stripes.

        "When you do wash them, turn them inside-out first.",
        "For best results, use a cold water setting.",
        "Avoid using a dryer, as this can cause the puffy paint to crack and degrade.",
        "Making Felt Soles for Handmade Socks Have a pair of crochet socks or slippers completed.",
        "This method will work the best on crochet slippers, but it may also work on crochet socks as well.",
        "You can also try it on knit socks or knit slippers too.",
        "If you made the socks yourself, have some of the yarn you used on hand; you will use this later on to attach the soles.",
        "If you didn't make the socks, or no longer have the yarn, you will need to buy more yarn that is a similar color and weight/thickness.",
        "Trace your foot onto a sheet of paper for the template.",
        "You can also use a flip flop, but it needs to fit your foot exactly.",
        "If this is for a pair of crochet slippers that already have a defined sole, you can just trace one of the soles instead.",
        "You only need 1 foot shape.",
        "You will use the same template to make 2 identical felt soles.",
        "Cut the template out, then use it to cut 2 soles out of wool felt.",
        "Cut the template out first, then pin it onto a sheet of 3-millimeter wool felt.",
        "Trace around the template with a marker, then cut it out.",
        "Repeat this step to make the second sole.",
        "Cut just inside the marker line; otherwise, the sole may end up too thick.",
        "Don't use the thin craft felt that you get in the kids section of a craft store.",
        "It is too flimsy.",
        "You can match the color to your socks, or you can use a contrasting color.",
        "Avoid using white, however; it will get dirty fast.",
        "Lay strips of masking tape across the soles.",
        "Set out your felt soles so that you have a left sole and a right sole.",
        "Lay strips of masking tape across each sole to make horizontal stripes.",
        "The stripes need to match the width of the tape--about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "For a twist, lay the strips of tape at a slight, diagonal angle instead.",
        "Paint the exposed felt with 4 layers of dimensional fabric paint.",
        "Squeeze out dimensional fabric paint onto a palette, such as a paper plate or a plastic lid.",
        "Use a foam brush to apply the paint to the felt between the strips of masking tape.",
        "Let each layer of paint dry for a few minutes before applying the next one.",
        "Let the paint dry completely before moving on.",
        "The paint can be the same color as the felt, or it can be a contrasting color.",
        "You need the 4 layers of paint.",
        "Any less, and you won\u2019t get a good grip.",
        "Dimensional fabric paint needs a long time to dry.",
        "It can take as long as 24 hours.",
        "Don\u2019t apply the paint straight from the bottle; it will be too lumpy.",
        "You want the paint to soak into the felt.",
        "Remove the tape, then punch holes around the perimeter of each sole.",
        "Make the holes about \u20448 inch (0.32 cm) from the outside edge and about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) apart.",
        "Mark them with a pen  first, then punch them with an awl or leather puncher.",
        "Be sure to peel the tape off before you start making the holes.",
        "The holes will make it easier to sew the soles on.",
        "Sew the soles onto your socks with a darning needle and yarn.",
        "Secure the soles to the bottom of each sock with safety pins first.",
        "Thread a darning needle with your yarn, then sew the soles onto the socks.",
        "Remove the safety pins when you are done.",
        "You can match the yarn color to the socks, the felt, or the paint.",
        "Be sure to sew up-and-down through the holes, like doing a straight stitch.",
        "Don\u2019t wrap the yarn around the edges of the soles, like with a whipstitch.",
        "Sew around the sole twice so that all the spaces between the holes are fill.",
        "You can also use a backstitch instead.",
        "Trying Other Materials Draw lines or dots with hot glue if you are in a hurry.",
        "Create cardboard inserts for your socks, just like you would for puffy paint soles.",
        "Squeeze out lines of hot glue across the bottom of your socks, or make dots instead.",
        "Wait a few minutes for the glue to dry, then remove the cardboard inserts.",
        "Hot glue dries rigid, so this method will work the best on thicker socks.",
        "If you use it on thinner socks, make the hot glue dots/lines thin.",
        "Make the lines horizontal so that they go from side-to-side.",
        "They can be straight or squiggly.",
        "If you made dots, arrange them in a grid-like pattern.",
        "Do not coat the entire bottom of the sock with a solid layer of hot glue.",
        "It won't be comfortable to walk on at all.",
        "Sew suede circles to the heels and toes if you have more time.",
        "Cut 1 circle and 1 oval out of suede.",
        "Use a leather hole puncher to make holes around the perimeter of each shape, about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) apart.",
        "Use a darning needle to hand-sew the circle to the heel of your sock, and the oval to the toe.",
        "Repeat this step for the second sock.",
        "This will work the best on crochet or knit socks and slippers, but you can try it on store-bought socks in a pinch.",
        "Use the same yarn to sew the shapes on that you used to make your socks.",
        "If you used thick yarn, choose a thinner yarn in the same color instead.",
        "You can do this with shelf liner too.",
        "Don't use fake suede or fake leather; they are too slippery.",
        "Use silicone sealer if you want the socks to be waterproof.",
        "Create cardboard inserts for your socks, just like with puffy paint soles.",
        "Apply a swirl of silicone sealer to the underside of each sock.",
        "Use your hand or a craft stick to spread the sealer into a thin, even layer.",
        "Wait 24 hours before removing the cardboard and wearing the socks.",
        "This method will make the socks stiff.",
        "It is recommended for handmade socks or slippers rather than thin, store-bought ones.",
        "If you are using your hand, it would be best to wear vinyl gloves.",
        "Silicone sealer comes in white and clear.",
        "You can also use a brush-on rug backing or rubber compound (i.e.",
        ": Plasti-Dip).",
        "Finished."
