        "Then plan on adding an additional 5% of the total square footage once you determine that.",
        "Find each room\u2019s square footage.",
        "First, create a list of all the rooms to be carpeted.",
        "Include the dimensions for each one.",
        "Then find the square footage of each room by multiplying its length and width.",
        "For example: 1) Master Bedroom: 16\u2019 L x 20.5\u2019 W = 328 square feet; 2) 1st Bedroom: 12\u2019 L x 10\u2019 W = 120 square feet; 3) 2nd Bedroom: 12\u2019 L x 10\u2019 W = 120 feet, and so on.",
        "Treat each interior space as its own separate line item.",
        "For instance: Master Bedroom Closet: 10\u2019 L x 3\u2019 W = 30 square feet.",
        "For odd-shaped rooms with multiple measurements, list each area separately.",
        "With an L-shaped living room, for example, enter line items like \u201cLR Area #1\u201d  and \u201cLR Area #2.\u201d Add up the total square footage(s).",
        "If you\u2019re using just one type of carpeting for your whole home, simply add up each individual square footage from your list to find the total.",
        "If using more than one type, only add each line item that will use Type 1.",
        "Then do the same for each additional type of carpeting that you\u2019ll be using.",
        "You want a separate total for each specific type of carpeting to be used in order to budget accordingly, in case one type is more expensive than another.",
        "However, for quotes regarding labor and installation, you really only need the general total.",
        "So if you\u2019re using more than one type, add up the total square footage for all types, too.",
        "Remember extra material.",
        "If you didn\u2019t round up your measurements before calculating each room\u2019s square footage, then multiply your total square footage(s) by 0.1.",
        "Add that figure to your total.",
        "If you did round up, err on the side of caution.",
        "Multiply your total square footages by 0.05 and add that number to the total.",
        "For example, if your total square footage is 1600:\nAn extra 10% would bring it up to 1760 square feet (1600 x 0.1 = 160, and 1600 + 160 = 1760).",
        "An extra 5%, on the other hand, would bring you up to 1680 (1600 x 0.05 = 80, and 1600 + 80 = 1680).",
        "Compare estimates.",
        "Always do some comparative shopping before settling on a carpet installer.",
        "Arrange for at least a couple different companies to visit your home and give you an estimate (minus any stairs).",
        "Ask each estimator how much material is needed to do the job.",
        "Compare this with your own estimate.",
        "Then:\nIf their estimate seems pretty close to your own, ask them for a second estimate that includes any stairs you want carpeted, too.",
        "If, however, their initial estimate is way higher than what you came up with on your own, move on to the next company."
