        "To remove the dust created by sanding, wipe down the area with a damp tack cloth.",
        "Rinse or replace the tack cloth as needed to remove all the dust and debris.",
        "Then, use a dry tack cloth to remove excess moisture.",
        "Wait until the surface is completely dry before moving on.",
        "Prime the marble with an oil-based primer.",
        "Be sure to select an oil-based primer, or the paint won\u2019t stick to the surface of the marble.",
        "Use a paint brush or roller to thinly coat the entire surface of the area you want to paint.",
        "Use long, even strokes in the same direction to prime the marble.",
        "Let the primer dry for 6-8 hours.",
        "If you don\u2019t let the primer dry fully, you may smear it and have to start the project over.",

        "Use a clean paint brush or roller to apply a thin, even layer of high-gloss oil-based paint in the color of your choice.",

        "After applying the first coat of paint, wait 16 hours or more before applying another coat.",
        "If you rush the job, the finish may bubble, smear, or become patchy.",
        "Apply additional coats as needed.",
        "You will definitely want to apply a second coat, and perhaps even a third or fourth, depending on the color you are painting and how it looks after each coat.",
        "Use the same method as before to apply additional layers, and remember to let each coat fully dry before moving on.",
        "Let the paint cure for 7 days.",
        "It\u2019s important not to touch or set anything on the marble surface in the meantime.",
