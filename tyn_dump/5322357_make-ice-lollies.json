Make sure the strawberry puree is completely frozen before you add the peach puree, or they will mix together. This will probably taste good, but the effect of having 3 individual sections of flavors will be ruined. Put the mold in the freezer until the peach mixture is frozen. This should take another 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Peel the kiwi with a knife or peeler and slice into smaller pieces. Make sure you remove all the fuzzy skin and discard the top and bottom tips. Puree the sliced kiwi and 1 1/4 tbsp simple syrup in the blender. Blend out all the chunks for a smooth and thick mixture. Again, you may want to taste the puree to make sure it's sweet enough. Pour the sweetened kiwi mixture into the ice lolly mold. Don't let the kiwi spill out of the top of the mold, or your lollies will all freeze together. Leave a little room at the top so you can insert the handle and give the puree a little room to expand as it freezes. Top the mold with the lid. Usually, molds come with a lid that also acts as the handle. You may have to push it into the already frozen part of the lollie. If your mold didn't come with a lid, you lost the lid, or you're using cups instead of store-bought molds, cover the top tightly with aluminum foil. Insert a popsicle stick through the aluminum foil. Make sure it is straight. It's okay if you have to push it into the frozen peach layer to make sure it's secure. Put the mold in the freezer for another 2 hours, or until the kiwi mixture is frozen. Test that the juice is completely frozen by wiggling the handle of one of the pops. It should be firm in the juice and not move at all. You can run warm water over the sides and bottom mold to help release ice lollies in one piece--just don't loosen them from the handle! Your finished ice lollies should be equal layers of pink, yellow, and green--just like a traffic light! After you've enjoyed these frozen treats, consider experimenting with other flavors. Try to stick with fruits that are all in season at the same time for the most harmonious flavors. Spring and summer fruits include blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, boysenberries, grapes, melons, nectarines, plums, peaches, and pluots. Blackberries, apples, kiwis, dates, kumquats, peaches, pomegranates, and raspberries are all in season during late summer and fall. Try grapefruit, kumquats, limes, mandarins, and pomelos in the winter. Oranges are in season all year long.",
