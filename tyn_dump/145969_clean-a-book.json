                    "description": "Different parts of the book will require their own cleaning methods. You\u2019ll want multiple tools on hand to address any potential problems your book may have. An artgum eraser is the perfect object for removing small pencil marks, smudges, and medium-sized blemishes on the pages. A soft cloth such as cut-up white t-shirt works well for gently cleaning surface dirt. You can also try an electrostatic cloth for an option that both lifts and holds dirt. You\u2019ll need a small, soft brush, such as a toothbrush, to clean bindings and page edges. If your book is extremely dirty or dusty, you might need to vacuum the surface. You\u2019ll need a vacuum with a low-suction setting and a soft-brush attachment. A document cleaning pad, which is a sieved cloth filled with eraser dust, will help remove a layering of dust from the pages, as well as smudges from matte dust jackets."
