                    "description": "You need the right equipment to melt gold. A crucible is a container that  is specifically designed to hold gold as it melts because it can withstand the extreme heat. A crucible is usually made of graphite carbon or clay. Gold\u2019s melting point is at about 1,943 degrees Fahrenheit (1064 \u00b0C), which means you will need temperatures that hot to melt it. Thus, it's very important that you don't just choose any container. In addition to a crucible, you will need a pair of tongs to move the crucible and hold it. These need to be made out of heat-resistant material. If you don't have a crucible, a homemade method uses a potato to melt gold instead of a crucible. To use this method, cut a hole into the potato, and place the gold in it."

                    "description": "Flux is a substance that is mixed with the gold before melting it. It is often a mixture of borax and sodium carbonate. You need more flux if the gold is impure. You can use many different formulas for flux mixtures. One method involves mixing borax and sodium carbonate. Add two pinches per ounce of clean jewelry scrap and more for dirty scrap. You can use regular baking soda or bicarbonate purchased from the store. When you heat it, it forms sodium carbonate. Flux helps hold together the fine gold particles, and it also helps remove impure materials from the gold as it heats. When using the potato method, add a pinch of borax into the hole in the potato before melting the gold."

Make sure that you wear safety goggles and a face shield to protect your face. You should put heat-resistant gloves on your hands and wear a heavy apron too. Never, ever melt down gold near something that is flammable. It can be very dangerous, and you don\u2019t want to cause a fire."

Be careful to bring the torch down slowly if you have fine powdered gold in the crucible because you could easily blow it around. Heating the crucible too fast also could crack it. You want to heat it thoroughly and slowly. An oxy-acetylene torch will melt the gold faster than propane. With a torch, hold the flame well above the gold powder and slowly work in a circular motion. Once the powder begins to heat up and turn red, you can begin to work the torch in slowly until your powder is reduced to a nugget."
