Multiply the number of dollar bills you needed by 6.14 inches (15.6 cm) to get an approximation of your waist measurement! For example, if you used 4 dollar bills around your waist, multiply that by 6.14. You\u2019ll get 24.36 inches (61.9 cm) for your waist circumference. If you\u2019re taping the dollar bills around your waist and the last one is overlapping the first dollar, you may need to fold it in half or in thirds. As a reference, a dollar bill is 3.125 inches (7.94 cm) folded in half, and 1.25 inches (3.2 cm) folded in thirds."

Make sure you\u2019re using standard printer paper. If you\u2019re using the above measurements and the paper is too long or thin, your waist measurement will come out inaccurate. If you get around your waist and the last piece of paper is too long, fold it in half or in thirds lengthwise to finish the measurement.
