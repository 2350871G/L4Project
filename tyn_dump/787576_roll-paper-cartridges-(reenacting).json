    "text": " Making the Wooden Dowel Take a 1/2\" wooden dowel and cut off a 6\" segment.  Using a 3/8\" drill bit, bore a cavity about 1/10\" into one end of the dowel.  Draw a guide line 4 1/2\" away from the end with the cavity. This will help you align the paper correctly. Making the Paper Trapezoid Print out the trapezoid pattern.  Use the pattern to cut a trapezoid out of blank newsprint or packaging paper.  Rolling the Cartridge Lay paper on a flat surface, with the acute angle pointing forward and left. (See picture.) Place the wooden dowel on the paper with the guide line along the right hand side of the paper, about 1/2\" from the bottom.  Roll the paper tightly around the dowel.  Twisting the Left Edge Leave the dowel in the paper, with the guide line along the right edge of the paper.  Twist the excess paper on the left edge tightly.  Fold the twisted edge onto itself. Crush into the hollow left by the wooden dowel by pressing against table. Remove the dowel.  Filling with Powder Measure the correct amount of black-powder.  Pour through the open end of the paper tube.  Twisting Right Edge Grab the paper directly above the black-powder and twist to make a seal. This leaves a paper \"tail\" above the twisting point. Fold down the paper tail alongside the cartridge. And you're done! Happy shooting!",
