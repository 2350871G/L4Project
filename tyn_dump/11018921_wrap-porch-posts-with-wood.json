If you have basic porch posts made from painted 4x4s, for instance, you might cut your spacers to be 4 inches (10 cm) wide and 5\u20136 inches (13\u201315 cm) tall. Double the number of pieces for each additional post you'll be wrapping. For a standard pair, you\u2019d need a total of 12 pieces cut to width; for 4 posts, you\u2019d need 24; for 6, you\u2019d need 36, and so on.Tip: The taller your spacers, the more room you\u2019ll have to comfortably fasten the panels of the facade later on."

Your second set of spacers needs to be wide enough to fit over the front and back of the posts with the first set of spacers in place on either side. That way, the edges will all sit flush with one another. To ensure that all of your components fit together the way they\u2019re supposed to, it\u2019s important to actually measure your spacer wood rather than simply trusting the listed dimensions. 1x4 boards, for example, are only \u20444 in (1.9 cm) thick, rather than the advertised 1 in (2.5 cm). If the post you're wrapping is 16 inches (41 cm) wide and the boards you're working with are \u20444 in (1.9 cm) thick, your second set of spacers would each need to be 17.5 inches (44 cm) wide. Write down the exact width of your wider spacer pieces. Doing so will make it much easier to rip the panel boards for the facades later.

        "For the sake of stability, it\u2019s best to cover each side of the post with a single panel, so be sure to pick up boards that are longer than your posts are tall.",
        "Trim the excess length from each board using your saw.",
        "Ordinary 1x4, 1x6, or 1x8 boards will work best for most post-wrapping projects.",
        "For slightly bulkier facades, you can also use 2 in (5.1 cm) boards.",
        "If all of your posts are exactly the same height, you can save yourself some time by sawing your first board to length, then using it as a template to cut the rest of your panels in quick succession.",
        "Trim your panel boards lengthwise to match your posts' new width.",
        "Trace the widths of your 2 sets of spacers onto the boards to serve as a guide for cutting.",
        "Set the fence on your saw to correspond to the desired dimensions of each board.",
        "Feed the boards into the blade vertically to split them into panels of a suitable size to cover the exterior of the posts around the spacers.",
        "This step will be a cinch if you recorded the width of your wide spacer pieces earlier\u2014all you have to do is mark and rip your panel boards to the same dimensions.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, you should end up with 2 wide panels and 2 narrow panels with edges that fit squarely together.",
        "Press the panels into place around the sides of the post.",
        "Brush the face of each exposed spacer with wood glue to make sure that the panels don't slip while you focus on maneuvering the next piece into position.",
        "Start with the sides, just like you did with the spacers, then move onto the front and back pieces.",
        "Placing the wider panels on the front and back of each post will prevent the seams between the individual boards from being visible when looking directly at the porch.",
        "Fasten the panels with nails every 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm).",
        "If possible, use a nail gun to speed things along.",
        "Otherwise, a hammer will get the job done just fine.",
        "Secure all 4 panels individually along both sides, focusing on making the rows of nails along both sides as symmetrical as possible.",
        "For a strong and inconspicuous assembly, use 3.5 in (8.9 cm) finishing nails.",
        "These will be long enough to bridge the gap between the outer panels and the posts themselves and seat securely.",
        "Remember to repeat this process for every post you\u2019re wrapping.",
        "Sealing and Painting the Posts Attach decorative molding to lend added elegance to the finished posts.",
        "Cut some spare 1 in (2.5 cm) boards to a height of roughly 4\u20136 in (10\u201315 cm) and fasten them to the lower part of the posts to form a set of simple baseboards.",
        "You can then cut a length of pre-shaped panel molding to fit around the top and bottom of the baseboards to jazz them up a bit.",
        "Secure the ends of each strip of molding using 1.5 in (3.8 cm) finishing nails.",
        "Shop around for a type of molding that complements the style of your home and the vision you have for your updated porch.",
        "Fill the exposed nail holes with wood filler.",
        "Spread a liberal amount of wood filler over each hole using the flat edge of a putty knife, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it dries completely.",
        "Run a sheet of high-grit sandpaper (120-grit or higher) over the dried filler with smooth, circular motions to sand down the excess material and bring it level with the surrounding surface.",
        "Wipe the surface with a damp cloth before and after you apply the wood filler to make sure it\u2019s free of sawdust and other debris.",
        "It isn\u2019t necessary to fill the nail holes in your new posts, but it will give them a more seamless look and make for an effortlessly even paint job.",
        "Seal the gaps in the facade with polyurethane-based caulk.",
        "Apply a thin, even line of caulk to the vertical seams between the panel boards.",
        "Then, seal all 4 horizontal edges at the top and bottom of the posts.",
        "Allow the caulk to dry for 3-12 hours as specified by the product directions.",
        "If you opted to add molding or similar decorative elements, be sure to seal the areas where the individual components come together, as well.",
        "Caulking the edges of the facade will prevent moisture from becoming trapped inside and causing rot or mildew.",
        "Paint your new posts to match your home's exterior.",
        "Apply a smooth, even coat of primer over the entire outer surface of each post.",
        "Once the primer dries to the touch, brush on 2-3 coats of water-resistant, latex-based outdoor paint.",
        "Let each coat dry for the amount of time recommended in the product directions before applying follow-up coats.",
        "Allow your final coat of paint to set for at least 24 hours before handling the posts or making any further modifications.",
        "Look for paints designed specifically for use on decks and porches.",
        "These typically contain tough resins that will help them stand up better to wear-and-tear.Tip: If you don\u2019t mind spending a little more money, you can cut out an extra step by using pre-primed boards, which you\u2019ll find at any hardware store or home improvement center."
