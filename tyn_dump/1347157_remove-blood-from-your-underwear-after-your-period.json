        "Take a washcloth, sponge, or even a stack of paper towels, and dip the corner in the hydrogen peroxide bowl.",
        "By doing this, the peroxide will be concentrated in one area on the cloth, so you will be able to apply it to the stain more precisely.",
        "Make sure the cloth or sponge you use is something that\u2019s okay to get stained, since it may absorb some of the blood.",
        "Dab the stain from the outside in.",
        "Press the saturated end of the cloth directly onto the blood stain.",
        "Blot the stain with the cloth, working from the outside edges in toward the center.",
        "Add more hydrogen peroxide to the cloth as you need it\u2014you want to soak the stain completely.",
        "You can even add more to the bowl if you need to.",
        "Move to a clean section of the cloth whenever the blood transfers to the section you\u2019re using.",
        "Rinse with cold water and repeat until the stain is gone.",
        "After you\u2019ve blotted away most of the stain, rinse your underwear out thoroughly under cold running water, then examine the fabric.",
        "If there are any areas that are still stained, continue blotting them until all of the blood is gone.",
        "If the stain was older and set-in, there may be some light staining that doesn\u2019t come up.",
        "In that case, try an enzymatic cleaner to try to remove the last of the blood.",
        "Once the stain is gone, air-dry your underwear or place them in the dryer.",
        "Cleaning Dark Underwear with Salt Mix salt with just a little cold water to create a scrub.",
        "The exact amount of salt you\u2019ll need will depend on the size and severity of the stain, but about 1/4 cup (75 g) is a good starting point.",
        "Add about 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of cold water, or just enough for the salt to clump together, and stir it together.",
        "Since the salt won\u2019t discolor your underwear, this approach is good for dark or brightly-colored fabrics.",
        "A salt scrub will be most effective if the blood is fresh, but it can also be helpful for set-in stains.",
        "You can mix the scrub in a bowl, or you could just pour the salt onto your underwear and add water.Tip: If you wear contacts, try using your saline solution instead!",
        "It will help draw out the stain similar to a salt scrub.",
        "It\u2019s especially handy if you notice a stain while you\u2019re out somewhere, but you have your contact solution with you.",
        "Coat the stain with the salt mixture.",
        "Spread the salt scrub generously over the stain on your underwear.",
        "The salt will help draw the blood out of the fabric, so try to cover the entire stain.",
        "If the stain is set in, try letting the salt sit on the fabric for about 5 minutes before you scrub the underwear.",
        "Scrub the stain with a cloth, an old toothbrush, or your fingers.",
        "Once the stain is thoroughly coated, rub the salt into the stain to help break it up.",
        "Try to work in a methodical direction, like from one end of the stain to the other or from the outside in.",
        "That way, you won\u2019t miss any areas as you\u2019re cleaning.",
        "For instance, you might work from the top of the stain to the bottom, from the left to the right, or all the around the perimeter toward the inside of the stain.",
        "Rinse away the salt with cool water when you\u2019re finished.",
        "After you\u2019ve removed as much of the stain as you can, hold the underwear under cool running water.",
        "Use your fingers to rub away any salt that\u2019s left, then examine the underwear to see if the stain is gone.",
        "Hot water will cause any remaining blood to set deeply into the fabric, where it will be difficult or impossible to remove.",
        "If the stain is gone, hang your underwear up to dry or put them in the dryer.",
        "If the stain is still there, try using a different approach to clean them.",
        "Trying Other Household Items for Set-In Stains Spray the stain with an enzyme cleaner to remove stubborn set-in stains.",
        "If you don\u2019t clean the stain right away or you wash it in hot water, blood can absorb deep into a fabric\u2019s fibers, creating a set-in stain that\u2019s difficult to get out.",
        "If that happens, try spraying the underwear with an enzymatic cleaner, which is designed to break down the enzymes in biological stains, like blood.",
        "Let it sit according to the label\u2019s directions, then wash your underwear in cold water.",
        "You can typically find enzymatic cleaners at major retailers that sell cleaning supplies, but if there isn\u2019t one available near you, you can order them online.",
        "Oxygenated bleach may also help remove set-in stains.",
        "If you don\u2019t have these products available, you might be able to remove the stain with items you already have at home, like baking soda, lemons, or meat tenderizer.",
        "Coat stains in a paste made from baking soda for gentle cleaning.",
        "Mix about 1/4 cup (45 g) of baking soda with 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of water at a time until it forms a thick paste.",
        "Then, spread that paste over the crotch of your underwear so it completely covers the stain.",
        "Leave the baking soda in place for at least 30 minutes, but for the best results, let it sit overnight.",
        "Afterward, wash and dry your underwear as usual.",
        "You can also make a paste from unseasoned meat tenderizer or crushed aspirin or ibuprofen tablets.",
