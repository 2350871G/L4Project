    "text": " Using Watermelon Gelatin Using a juicer, juice the limes. Let the juice drop through a sieve into a bowl so that you can catch the seeds easily. Reserve the juice for another use.  Turn the lime rinds inside out.  Find the membrane that connects the pith to the rind and pull on it to separate the pith from the rest of the lime, using a paring knife if needed.  Turn the limes right side out so that they resemble hollow cups.  Position the lime rinds on a cookie sheet so that their edges are touching. This will ensure that the limes stay upright while the gelatin sets. Boil 1 cup of water on the stovetop in a small saucepan.  Add gelatin to the boiling water and stir with a whisk until it completely dissolves.  Stir in the vodka.  Pour the gelatin mixture into the lime halves.  Refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours until the gelatin has set.  Cut the lime halves into 4 equal portions, using a sharp chef\u2019s knife.  Place the \u201cwatermelons\u201d on a tray and serve them.
