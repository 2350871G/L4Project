By the time you finish, the body of your vehicle should be shiny and free of dirt. The turtle wax will work best when your car is spotless. Start washing your car at the wheels. Any dirt that\u2019s collected onto the wheels of your car could splash up onto the body while you wash. Tending to the wheels before washing the rest of the car minimizes the chance of splatter. Wash your car in a shady area. If you leave your car in the sun during washing, the heat, water, and leftover soap will stain the car. Choosing a shady spot to wash your car minimizes the risk of staining. Spray detailer onto your car after washing. Detailer adds extra sheen to your car and keeps it safe from stains. Use a soft towel to rub the detailer after spraying."
