Lay the letters in a circle. Put a sun on the top left hand corner, next to the word \"yes\". On the top right corner, put a moon next to the word \"no\". Put the numbers outside the circle on a table. Use a tumbler turned upside down on top of the paper as a pointer. Sit around the table with a couple of friends. Each of you place one hand lightly on the up-turned glass. Decide who will ask the questions. Another person could be taking notes. Create letters. Start by writing out all of the letters in one or two rows. Make sure that the characters are large enough to read easily. Add numbers. In the row below the letters write the numbers 0-9. Write out \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \"Hello\" and \u201cGoodbye\u201d symbols. These will make communicating with the spirits easier. You can add any other phrases if you wish. Make cut outs. Take scissors to cut out each of the characters, numbers, words, and phrases. Adhere them with glue to the paper. Lay them out according to your desired layout. Create the pointer slide. You can make it a smooth surface. A glass or sheet protector should work well. Prepare to invite some guests. You are now ready to have your first talking board s\u00e9ance! Constructing Wooden Boards Gather your materials. You will need a wood board, sanded and smooth.

Varnish the surface. The varnish or other clear coating will create the smooth surface necessary to make the planchette work. Carefully follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding the finish you decide to use. You will likely need to do several coats. Let each coat dry before applying the next. Set aside plenty of time for this project. Add finishing details. You can paint on more details once the varnish has dried completely.
