For example, if you have really long legs, raising the seat a little higher than hip-height can reduce tension on your knees."

    "text": " Setting the Seat Position Turn the lever below the seat to the left to loosen it. Find the lever that adjusts the height of the seat located on the frame of the bike below the seat. Rotate it to the left, or counterclockwise, to loosen it. Turn it so the seat is loose enough to be moved up and down. Allow the lever to keep a little bit of tension on the seat so it doesn\u2019t slide all the way down as you adjust it. Stand next to the bike and move the seat so it\u2019s aligned with your hip. Once the seat is loose enough to move, use your hands to raise it up or down. Move the seat so it\u2019s in line with the bone of your hip so it\u2019s adjusted to the proper height. Aligning the seat with your hip bone is recommended for first time users, but eventually, you may find that a different seat position is more comfortable for you. For example, if you have really long legs, raising the seat a little higher than hip-height can reduce tension on your knees. Tighten the seat by turning the lever to the right. Lock the seat into position by rotating the lever on the frame clockwise, or to the right. Continue turning the lever until the seat is held firmly and securely.Tip: If the lever is sticking out at an angle after you tighten it, pull it out and allow it to point straight down so it\u2019s out of your way when you use the bike. Loosen the lever underneath the seat by turning it to the left. Find the lever that adjusts the depth of your seat, which is located on the underside of it. Rotate it counterclockwise to loosen it so you can easily move the seat forward or backward with your hands. Use the length of your arm to adjust the seat to the proper depth. Stand next to your bike and rest your elbow on the nose, or the very front of the seat. Then, keeping your elbow on the seat, try to touch the handlebars with your fingertips. Move the seat so that your fingertips just touch the handlebars. Using your elbow and fingertips is an easy way for beginners to find a proper seat depth, but you may find that a different position is more comfortable for you. Rotate the lever to the right to tighten the seat. Use 1 hand to hold the seat in position and turn the lever to the right to tighten it. Continue rotating the lever as far as you can so the seat is held firmly and securely in position. Adjusting the Handlebar Height Loosen the lever on the front of the bike by turning it to the left. Find the lever that controls the height of the handlebars located on the very front of the bike. Turn the lever counterclockwise to loosen the handlebars so they can be moved up and down. Stand in front of the seat and place your forearms under the handlebars. Stand with the frame of the bike between your legs and the handlebars in front of you. Cradle the handlebars with your forearms and bend your knees slightly. Don\u2019t try to raise the handlebars from the front or side of the bike or you could strain your back. Lift the handlebars and hold them in place. Press up through your forearms to raise the handlebars. When you\u2019ve reached your desired height, hold them in place with 1 of your arms cradled beneath them.Tip: If you\u2019re adjusting the handlebars for the first time, set them at the highest setting. You can always lower them to a more comfortable position later. Tighten the lever by turning it to the right to secure the handlebars. With 1 arm cradling the handlebars to keep them held in position, use your other hand to rotate the adjustment lever to the right to tighten it. Continue turning the lever as far as you can so the handlebars are held in position. Clipping in and out of the Bike Stand with 1 foot on each side of the bike frame and the pedals lying flat. Stand over the center of the bike frame with the pedals between your legs. Move the pedals so they\u2019re aligned horizontally with the ground and the Peloton logo is facing up. The Peloton logo must be facing up in order for you to fit your shoes into the grooves on the pedals. Insert the cleat of 1 shoe into the grooves of a pedal with your toes pointing down. Peloton bikes use \u201cclipless\u201d pedals, so you\u2019ll need to wear cycling shoes with a 3-bolt cleat that fit into them. Align the cleat on the bottom of 1 of your shoes with the grooves on the top of 1 of the pedals. Point your toes down as you slide 1 of your shoes into the grooves and begin to push forward on the pedal. You don\u2019t have to use the Peloton brand shoes to clip into the bike. Any cycling shoe that has a 3-bolt cleat mount will work just fine! Keep your other foot firmly planted on the ground to provide balance. Push down on the pedal until you hear it click into place. Drive through the heel of your foot as you rotate the pedals. Continue pushing until you hear a \u201cclick\u201d and your shoe snaps into place on the pedal.Tip: If you\u2019re having trouble clipping into the bike, hold down the brake button below the handlebars and put your full weight onto pedal to snap your shoe into place. Slide your other foot into the other pedal and press forward. Move the pedals so they\u2019re lying flat and insert the cleat of your other shoe into the grooves on the top of the other pedal. Point your toes down and drive through your heel as you rotate the pedals until you hear it snap into place. Kick your heel outward and your toes inward to clip out of the bike. Whenever you\u2019re ready to clip out of the bike, bring the pedals to a complete stop. Then, use 1 swift motion to kick your heel outward and drive your toes toward the frame of the bike. The locking mechanism will disengage and you can remove your foot from the pedal. Repeat the motion on the other side to remove your other shoe. Never try to clip out while the pedals are still spinning or you could seriously injure yourself. Riding the Peloton Bike Turn on your Peloton bike and enter your subscription information to activate it. Press the power button on the touchscreen to turn on the bike and bring up the main menu. Follow the onscreen prompts to enter information such as your time zone and the email you used to pay for your subscription. Choose the subscription for the account and tap the button that says \u201cActivate.\u201d\nIf you received your Peloton bike as a gift, enter the subscription activation key instead of your email. Add any additional riders that may use the bike as well. Create a leaderboard name that represents you. When you login to your Peloton bike\u2019s home screen for the first time, you\u2019ll be prompted to create a screen name that will appear on the leaderboard and the class roster. Choose one that tells a little bit about yourself and is relatively simple and easy to read so your instructor can give you a shout out during a live class. For example, if you\u2019re a stay-at-home mom, and you\u2019re looking to be more active, you could choose a screen name like, \u201cFitMomEmma.\u201d Or, if you\u2019re an early riser, you could choose something like, \u201cZeroDarkThirtyRider.\u201d\nAvoid vulgar or complicated leaderboard names like, \u201cxX_JR1996M_xX_\u201d which can be difficult to read. Your leaderboard name can give a sense of who you are, which will help you find riders with similar personalities and interests. Check out the Peloton 101 tutorial if you\u2019re brand new to the bike. Once you\u2019re logged into the home screen, look for the video series labeled \u201cPeloton 101\u201d in the list of menu options. If you\u2019re just getting started riding your Peloton bike, spend some time going through the videos so you can get even more familiar with your bike. You don\u2019t have to watch all of the tutorial at once if you\u2019re ready to get to a ride. You can always check it out later. Choose an on-demand ride to ride whenever you want. Once you\u2019re logged in, look through the onscreen menu for lists of rides that you can choose. If you can\u2019t make the time that a live class is set to start, or you just want to choose your own ride on your own time, select the on-demand menu. Scroll through the options and read the descriptions find one that sounds appealing to you. You can still save your stats and details during on-demand rides so you can revisit them later and add to your overall riding scores. Look at the type of ride to find one that\u2019s right for you. For example, choose a \u201cBeginner\u201d ride if you\u2019re new to the bike, or choose a \u201cHeart Rate Zone\u201d ride for a cardio-focused ride. Join a live ride if you want to participate in real-time. Check the times on the home screen for upcoming live rides and join the lobby about 10 minutes before the ride is set to start so you can participate in the warmup and class discussion. You\u2019ll be able to actively participate in real-time and ask questions or receive feedback from the instructor. You\u2019ll get a shoutout from the instructor for your first live ride! Select an encore ride to have your results on a live leaderboard. If you can\u2019t make it for a live ride, you can choose one from the encore menu to participate in a pre-recorded ride with an active leaderboard. You\u2019ll have real-time riders participating with you, and you\u2019ll be able to save your stats for the ride to contribute to your total riding scores. An encore ride is a great option if you have certain instructors that you prefer, but you can\u2019t always make their live rides. Follow the directions of your instructor during your ride. Whenever a ride starts, follow the commands of the instructor so you can get the most out of your ride while also ensuring that you do it safely. When your instructor says to speed up, speed up! When they tell you to slow down, slow down. Each ride has an intentional structure and pace for you to follow.Safety Tip: Always follow the warm-up and cool-down portion of the rides so you don\u2019t injure or strain anything. Increase the resistance by turning the resistance knob clockwise. During the ride, your instructor will tell you to either increase or decrease the resistance. To do this, locate the resistance knob on the frame of the below the handlebars. Turn it to the right to increase the resistance and to the left to decrease the resistance. As you get more experienced, you\u2019ll become better at finding the right amount of resistance for you. Press the resistance knob straight down to apply the brakes. If you need to slow down your bike or bring it to a quick stop, you can apply the brakes by pressing the resistance knob straight down. Continue holding the knob down until the pedals have slowed enough to allow you to bring them to a stop on your own. Learning the Lingo Use the Peloton picks program to try different coaching styles. Every Peloton coach will have their own way of motivating you and have a vocabulary that is slightly different than other instructors. Explore the Peloton picks option on the home screen to try out rides with different instructors so you can find one that you enjoy. As you ride with them more often, you\u2019ll pick up on their unique cues and lingo. You\u2019ll also see when each instructor has scheduled live rides so you can work to incorporate them into your schedule. Place your hands at the widest part of the handlebars for 1st position. Take a comfortable seated position on the seat of the bike, also known as the saddle. Lean forward with your back flat and straight, your shoulders relaxed, and your chest open to allow your lungs to expand. Place your hands at the widest part of the handlebars. Whenever an instructor tells you to go back to 1st position in a ride, gently return to this position. If you have to reach for the handlebars, try adjusting your seat so it\u2019s closer and more comfortable for you. Rise out of the seat and continue to pedal to be in 2nd position. Turn the resistance knob clockwise so it takes more effort to pedal. Stand up out of the seat with your head up and chest open as you continue to pedal. Position your hips so they\u2019re directly over the pedals and place your hands on the bend of the handlebars to support your upper body. 2nd position is often used for low-speed, high resistance standing jogs. Stand with your hips in front of the pedals to use 3rd position. Increase the resistance by turning the knob so you can stand out of the seat. Rise up out of the seat with your head high and your chest open and position your hips in front of the pedals as you continue to turn them. Place your hands at the top of the handlebars for stability. This position is often used for steep climbs or to accelerate to high speeds.Tip: If 3rd position is too difficult for you, try using 2nd position, or simply remain in a seated position. As your stamina and core strength increases, you can work your way up to it! Calculate your Power Zone so you can push yourself on rides. Select an \u201cFTP\u201d test ride from the library on your monitor and complete it to find your specific zones so you can use them to go on Power Zone rides. Knowing your specific zones will help you understand how hard you need to push yourself in order to stay in the zone and get the most out of your rides. Focusing on Power Zone rides will also allow you to track your progress as you get better and better. Look for the instructors Denis Morton and Matt Wilpers in the library to find FTP test rides you can use to find your zones. Give high-fives to other riders by tapping their profile picture. During a live or encore ride, you can congratulate another rider or simply say hello by sending them a \u201chigh-five.\u201d Locate the profile picture of the person you want to high-five next to their leaderboard name on your home screen. Double-tap the picture with your finger to send them a high-five. The other rider will be notified that you send them a high-five and they may send one in return. If someone breaks their own record or if you both just survived a tough steep climb, a high-five is a great way to motivate each other! Join a tribe that appeals to you to find a community of riders. On the leaderboard during rides, you\u2019ll see various groups of riders labeled with a hashtag, such as #PelotonMoms or #PowerZonePack. These are \u201ctribes\u201d or groups of riders who have similar interests that participate in rides together. Join a tribe that shares similar interests so you can ride with them and keep yourself motivated. For example, there are tribes of doctors, lawyers, teachers, early morning risers, and many more that you can choose to join. Many tribes also have Facebook groups that you can join so you can communicate with them outside of the Peloton rides. Earn a Century Shirt by completing 100 rides. Once you finish your 100th ride, you\u2019re eligible for a Peloton Century Shirt that you can wear to show off your accomplishment. Look for an email within a week or so after you finish your 100th ride, or reach out to the Peloton support team to ask about it if you don\u2019t receive an email. The shirt itself is free, but you\u2019ll need to pay a shipping fee to have it sent to you. Shipping usually costs about $7 or so. If you try to buy a Century Shirt before you earn it, it will cost $100,000!",
