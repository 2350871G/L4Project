    "text": " Basic bangle from a plastic bottle Clean out the drink bottle. Allow the bottle to dry properly before making the bangles. Measure the width of the bangle. This will be determined by your preference, along with what the bangle needs to hold by way of decoration. Tape off the chosen width around the bottle. Use masking tape to do this, as it will be easier to remove than stronger tape. Using scissors or a craft knife, cut out the bangle shape from the bottle. Work carefully and gradually. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, ask someone who is happy to do the cutting to do it for you. Sand down the edges if needed. If the edges seem a little rough, use an emery board to quickly make them smooth again. Cut as many of these plastic bangles as you want from the bottle. If you're making gifts for friends, it's a good idea to make lots of basic bangles in readiness for decorating. Duct tape plastic bottle bangle Choose the duct tape. What color or pattern of duct tape would you like for a bangle? The choice is entirely up to you. Cut a large piece of duct tape. Wrap this tape around the plastic bangle, ensuring that the join meets on the inside of the bangle. Cut a thin strip of duct tape. Carefully run it around the inside join, so that the join is smooth and won't bother you when worn. Add decorative elements if wished. It is recommended that you draw up the design before cutting, arranging and gluing decorative pieces in place. You could glue on a piece of leather in a line, zigzag formation or as a series of designs. Add costume jewels, beads and other pretty objects to the bangle, as wished. Consider adding some ribbon for a final touch. Done. The duct tape plastic bangle is now ready for wearing. Bead and foil plastic bottle bangle Cut a length of foil tape (copper, silver or gold) to fit around the bangle. Allow a small overlap as well as the size of the bangle, to allow you to wrap it over onto the outer side. Wrap the foil tape around of both sides of the plastic bangle. The join should meet in the middle of the outside of the bangle. This join will shortly be covered up by the beads. Cut a width of double-sided tape. This width should be less than the width of the bangle, so that you can see the foil tape either side of it when applied to the bangle. Carefully wrap the double sided tape around the center of the outside edge of the bangle. Be sure to cover the join from the foil tape. Leave the upper backing on the double-sided tape until you're ready to add the micro beads. Tip the micro beads into a small container. This will keep them in place and provides a place for you to roll the bangle. Remove the backing from the double-sided tape. Roll the bangle slowly in the container of beads, pressing gently to pick up the micro beads on the double sided tape. Hold the bangle by the edges as you do this. Brush the sealant over the micro beads. This will hold them in place. As you do this, press more micro beads into place where there are gaps, using the sealant to keep them intact. Allow the sealant to dry. Adjust any areas which seem to be missing micro beads if needed, using the sealant as adhesive. Lay on wax paper or a silicone sheet to dry. When dry, check for any loose beads and fix as needed. Finished. The beaded foil bangle is now ready for wearing. Fabric wrapped water bottle bangles Choose the fabric. This can be from almost any source, so don't hold back. You could make bangles that match your entire wardrobe! Fabric sources include:\nScrap fabric or new fabric\nRibbon\nLace\nOld clothing\nOld house linen\nHandkerchiefs, etc. Cut the fabric into strips.  Choose your method of application. You can either wrap the fabric around and around the bangle, creating neat overlap lines; or, you can carefully wrap the entirety of the bangle, gluing into the middle of the inside of the bangle.

The fabric-covered bangle is now ready to wear. Foil wrapped bottle bangle Select a suitable color of foil paper. Maybe choose a color to match an outfit. Measure the paper foil. Measure the circumference of the bangle, along with a small allowance extra for wrapping around to the inner side. Cut the paper foil. Follow the measurement you've made. Wrap the bangle. Wrap the foil paper piece around the outside of the bangle, folding it inside. Affix the foil paper from the inside. Glue in place, to prevent the foil paper from unraveling. For additional certainty, glue a length of thin ribbon to cover the foil paper join. Apply Mod Podge or another clear sealant to the foil paper.
