You can make your own templates or print them out from online. If you are making your own templates, look at lots of reference pictures to make sure that they are accurate.

You don't have to do this, but it will make your mask more accurate. Chiffon will work the best. You can also use white tights instead.

For a more detailed mask, outline the black eye patches with black puffy paint. If you want an even more realistic mask, cut the hood off of a red sweatshirt, then hot glue the opening to the top and sides of the mask. You can also just wear the mask with the red hoodie.

This step is optional, but it will help make the mask look more believable. Glue the eye patches onto the mask. Again, you can use hot glue or fabric glue for this. If you want a nicer finish on your mask, fold the edges of the eye patches down by about \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) as you glue them. This will give you a nice, hemmed look.If you made the Styrofoam pieces, leave a gap in the bottom of the patches while gluing them on. You\u2019ll add the Styrofoam later. Avoid pinning the fabric if you use fabric glue; the pins will leave marks and creases. You don't need to pin the fabric if you use hot glue either; it sets up fast. Pin and sew the front seams to better fit the mask to your face. Deadpool\u2019s mask has 2 seams running down the front, starting just below the eye patches and finishing at the neck. Pull the mask on inside-out and pin the fabric in these areas until it feels more snug. Pull the mask off, sew the seams with a straight or zigzag stitch, then remove the pins.If you need to, draw the seams with a marker first. Make them angle slightly towards your chin, but don\u2019t actually have them meet. You want the mask to be tight enough so that it follows the shape of your jaw, but not so tight that you can\u2019t pull it off. Trim the seams to reduce bulk, then turn the mask right-side-out. Use scissors to cut the seams until they are about \u20444 or \u20442 inch (0.64 or 1.27 cm). Because stretchy fabric does not fray, you don\u2019t need to finish the seams. If you made Styrofoam inserts, slide them into the eye patches after you have turned the mask right-side-out, then finish gluing the patches.",
