Areas with widespread creeping charlie will take a long time to manually remove, so you might consider sunlight deprivation or chemical treatment in these cases. It is recommended you wear gloves for protection if you plan to pull the plant out by hand. Gloves can prevent blisters, friction burns, and callouses from forming during manual removal. Creeping charlie is a common skin allergen that can cause itching or a rash from contact. Wearing gloves will prevent you from having an unexpected allergic response while weeding."

                    "description": "For plants that are especially thick, you should cut off the leaves and vines to make the roots more accessible. You can do this most easily with a few snips from a pair of pruning shears. Once the protective upper foliage is removed, you'll be able to target the roots in the ground. Keep bits and pieces of creeping charlie collected together off to the side or put it in a bag for disposal later. Lost bits and pieces can reseed your plot with the plant. You may want to avoid doing this on windy days. The wind might blow a stray leaf or vine somewhere else you don't want the plant growing. It is not recommended you use a hoe to break up the soil or cut through the top layer of the plant. This can spread creeping charlie even further."

Grasp the root by its topmost part and apply firm, steady pressure until the roots pull free. You may need to use a rooting tool, which is shaped like a long, flat-tipped screwdriver, to assist in removing difficult plants or those with deep-sunk roots.
