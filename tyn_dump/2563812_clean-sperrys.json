Suede is treated differently and has a napped finish because it is made of the underside of animal skin. Follow the cleaning instructions for suede shoes to avoid causing damage. Cleaning Canvas Sperrys Mix warm water and liquid detergent in a bucket or water basin. Fill a bucket with warm water and add a mild laundry detergent. Liquid detergent works best, but powdered detergent can be used if on hand. Swirl the solution around until the detergent is completely dissolved. If bubbles appear and the surface is worked into a lather, your solution is ready to be used. Dip a bristle brush into the solution and scrub the shoes.

Wait until your Sperrys are completely dry before wearing to avoid athlete's foot or other fungal diseases. Cleaning Suede Sperrys Rub down your shoes gently with a suede brush. Suede's soft grain is best cleaned with a suede brush. Brush the shoe gently to remove dust or dirt accumulated on the surface. Brush repeatedly in the same direction in short strokes to avoid scuffing your shoes. For scuffs that are especially matted down, try rubbing the area with sandpaper to lift the nap.

Sprinkle cornstarch over the shoes for oil stains. If your shoe stains do not disappear from the method above, they may be oil stains. Sprinkle cornstarch lightly over the stain and let it sit for ten minutes. Cornstarch absorbs oil and prevents it from soaking into the suede, especially if the stain is treated early.",
