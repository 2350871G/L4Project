Avoid picking apricots that are still green or that have bruises because they may taste more bitter than ripe fruit. Lightly squeeze the apricots to make sure they don\u2019t have any soft spots that could affect the flavor. You can dry store-bought or home-grown apricots. If you\u2019re using home-grown apricots, try to pick them fresh off the tree before they fall on the ground so they\u2019re less likely to have bruises. You may also cut off bruised or discolored areas of the fruit with a knife."

        "Otherwise, place the container in your fridge if you want to enjoy the pieces cold.",
        "Keep the dried apricot until the pieces begin hardening and become difficult to chew.",
        "You may also freeze the apricots for up to 18 months.",
