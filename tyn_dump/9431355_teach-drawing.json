        "For example, you could say to a student \u201cNice job, I really like how you shaded this drawing.",
        "Is there anything you would change or do differently next time?\u201d Avoid having students copy directly from your drawings.",
        "It\u2019s OK to demonstrate a technique for your students, but having them copy your own drawings can interfere with their creativity.",
        "Encourage students to draw from their own observation.",
        "They\u2019ll become better observers, and they won\u2019t think there\u2019s a right and wrong way to draw.",
        "Encourage your students to look at whatever they\u2019re drawing.",
        "Sometimes new drawers have a tendency to look down at their paper, and not the object they\u2019re drawing.",
        "Remind students to look up at what they\u2019re drawing if you notice them sketching with their head down a lot.",
        "This will teach them to draw from observation as opposed to memory Remind your students that anyone can learn how to draw.",
        "Let them know that drawing is a learned skill, not an innate talent.",
        "If you\u2019re teaching someone to draw and they get discouraged, tell them they will get better with practice.",
        "It's important that students don't feel like they're naturally bad drawers, or they could give up on the learning process."
