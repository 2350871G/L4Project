Italians twirl the pasta because it allows them to capture other ingredients that are blended into the pasta dish, like nuts or capers. This method works with more pasta dishes than spaghetti. Traditionally, you would see more Italians using both a fork and a spoon to twirl their pasta. While this is not technically wrong, the modern trend is to use a fork instead.

Some people then twirl the fork on a spoon, but others just use the fork. If using a fork and spoon, hold the spoon in your left hand, and the fork in your right. Push the fork tines through the pasta meeting the spoon on the opposite side. Hold the spoon firmly, and twirl the fork until no strands are hanging from it. Now, lift the fork to your mouth. You could also cut the pasta into small pieces with a fork or knife, making it easy to eat with either a fork or a spoon. Many people will serve spaghetti noodles to children in this manner."
