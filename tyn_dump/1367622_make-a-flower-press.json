Choosing Flowers to Press Pick flowers when they are dry. The best time to pick your flowers is in the morning after the dew has evaporated. This is when they will be the most fresh. Harvest flowers when they are about to open or just before their peak. Pressed flower buds are lovely, as are flowers which are fully bloomed. Try to pick flowers in a variety of stages for a natural look. Select flowers with naturally flat blooms, like violets and daisies. Other flowers that press well include single-petal roses, Cosmos, California poppy, and Queen Anne\u2019s Lace. Flowers with bulky blooms, like roses or carnations, take much longer to dry and don\u2019t look as nice when they're pressed. You may want to hang them to dry them instead. Remove any obvious stamens from your flowers. Some flowers, like lilies, have stamens which protrude from the petals. Remove these before you press the flower or the stamen will leave a stain on the dried petals. Press leaves, ferns, and grasses if you want to accent your flowers. If you're going to display your flowers in a frame, you can add other natural touches by drying leaves, grasses, herbs, and ferns in your press. Pressing Your Flowers Unscrew the nuts to make room on your flower press. You don\u2019t have to take the nuts all the way off, just loosen them enough that you can slide the flower into the press. Place the flowers or leaves between the paper in your flower press. Make sure the flowers are not hanging off of the side of the press. Trim the stem or choose another flower if the one you chose doesn't fit on the press. Do not overlap the flowers. Arrange the flowers on the paper so they are not touching each other, or else they\u2019ll be stuck together when they\u2019re dry. Tighten the nuts to close the press. There's no need to force the nuts tighter than you can comfortably tighten them, but it should feel like it's secured. You may want to check the press every few days to tighten it more as the flower dries. Leave the press undisturbed for at least 3 weeks.
