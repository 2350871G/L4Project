This recipe makes enough batter for four 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) thick slices of bread, or six \u00be-inch (1.91-centimeter) thick slices of bread. Beat the eggs, vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon. Crack the eggs into a shallow dish, then beat them with a whisk until they turn pale yellow and no streaks remain. Add the vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon, and whisk again. Heat a large nonstick frying pan over medium heat. It you don't have a nonstick pan, grease a regular with about 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of butter or coconut oil. Allow the pan to get hot enough to sizzle a droplet of water. Dip a slice of bread in the batter. Dip first one side, then the other. Hold the bread in the batter for a few seconds to ensure that it is completely soaked. Allow the excess batter to drip back into the dish before proceeding. Add the bread to the pan and let it cook for 2 to 4 minutes on each side. Cook the bread for 2 to 4 minutes, turn it over with a spatula, then cook it for  to 4 minutes more.
