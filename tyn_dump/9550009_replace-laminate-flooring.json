        "Once it\u2019s been modified, it should fit perfectly.",
        "While a table saw, circular saw, or miter saw will make the cleanest cuts and help reduce splintering, a standard handsaw will also get the job done.",
        "Be sure to subtract \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) from the floor measurement you take to account for expansion.",
        "Stagger the seams in the second row of planks.",
        "With the first row of flooring in place, you can begin laying out the second row.",
        "This time, adjust the positioning of the planks so that the seams created where the ends meet offset those in the first row by 6\u201312 inches (15\u201330 cm).",
        "You can return to the original configuration for the following row, or situate the seams randomly for a more asymmetrical appearance.",
        "Staggering the seams in the flooring ensures that it\u2019s equally sturdy at every point.",
        "It also makes for a more attractive overall appearance.",
        "Snap the planks together.",
        "Feed the tongue (the side with the protruding edge) of each plank in the second row into the groove in the reverse side of those in the first row.",
        "Press the planks together firmly until they interlock.",
        "They\u2019ll essentially fit together like puzzle pieces.",
        "If you\u2019re having trouble fitting one plank into another, try angling it in from a few inches above the floor.",
        "The tongue-edge and groove-edge of all the planks should be facing the same direction.",
        "Completing Installation Continue assembling the planks until you\u2019ve covered the entire subfloor.",
        "Proceed 1 row after the other, remembering to alternate the placement of the seams between rows.",
        "Check your work as you go.",
        "There should be no gaps between the planks.",
        "It may be necessary to rip the final row of planks (cut them lengthwise) to get them to properly fit the remaining space.",
        "Apply pressure to the flooring.",
        "After every 2-3 rows, set a piece of heavy furniture or a stack of boxes or similar objects on top of the new laminate.",
        "The added weight will flatten out the planks and help them settle into place.",
        "It will also prevent them from shifting or coming dislodged while you finish up the rest of the floor.",
        "Allow the weighted objects to remain in place until you begin installing the next few rows.",
        "You also have the option pushing a weighted roller over the entire floor when you\u2019ve finished installing it.",
        "Place transition strips at doorways and other openings.",
        "Measure each doorway, threshold, closet, or nook in the room where the laminate will meet another type of flooring.",
        "Trim the included transition strips to the appropriate length, then tap them down until they\u2019re seated snugly.",
        "Don\u2019t subtract the \u20448 inch (0.95 cm) expansion gap allowance for the transition strips.",
        "They need to be left slightly longer in order to sit flush.",
        "Install quarter-round moulding around the edges of the room.",
        "Pick out a set of wood moulding that matches the look of your new flooring.",
        "Alternatively, you can reattach the same baseboards and trim you were using before.",
        "Fasten the moulding with finishing nails, then stand back and admire your handiwork!",
        "Measure and cut new moulding to the room specifications you took previously.",
        "Don\u2019t forget to remove the spacers from around the edges of the room before putting the moulding back on."
