If that\u2019s not an option, search while they\u2019re busy elsewhere in the house. It helps to have a quick place to hide if you hear someone coming. You can also search at night if you think you could do so without getting caught. However, be extremely careful. Don't do this if anyone you live with has violent reactions or owns a gun. You could be mistaken for a burglar."

If there is any gap in the paper, you might be able to see the color of the box, and at least figure out where they were shopping. If it's almost square and about 5-inches (140 mm) long, it's obviously a CD. Just think about saying anything to your parents about your favorite CD that you want, and that's probably what it is. If it's slim, rigid and rectangular, it's most likely a DVD or video game, especially if you hear a distinctive disc rattling sound when you shake it. A similarly shaped present that dips inwards on all but one of the edges is a hardback book, and if it's slightly bendy it's a paperback book. If it's a long, soft rectangle that's not too deep, it might be clothes. Soft and roughly cylindrical presents could be socks. If a squishy present is unusually round or otherwise oddly shaped, it's likely a stuffed toy. A box that is larger on the bottom, and has a really skinny top, is usually either two similar gifts wrapped together or a game of some sort. If there's a second, smaller box taped to the the outside, it's probably batteries for the game. If the box is about the size of a shoe box, feel around the sides of the box, near the top. If there's a lip, you can be pretty certain you have new shoes! If it's a very long and thin cuboid, try not to drool; you've probably got some candy.

Some parents booby-trap presents that are already wrapped by putting them inside bigger boxes stuffed with paper, packing peanuts or other things to reduce sound when you shake them. If you can\u2019t guess what a large present is based on its size, this might be why. Truly clever parents will nest smaller boxes inside larger boxes if they catch you snooping. You'll open one box, and find another and then another. Your Big Present may actually turn out to be a gag gift, like a magic decoder ring, or some other silly stocking stuffer.

        "Long, very light cylinders are surely posters, and square flat ones usually turn out to be calendars.",
        "Shake the box.",
        "Does it make any rattling noises, or can you feel something move inside when you shake?",
        "If it does, try to describe what you hear.",
        "If you hear chime sounds, it might be a music box; if you hear thumps, it could be something inside something else.",
        "If you hear broken glass, put the box down!",
        "If you hear broken glass, you may have already broken something inside.",
        "Take a quick peek inside the box if you hear this, and if something is broken, go apologize to your parents.",
        "It's better to tell the truth now and face the consequences than lying your way out of it later.",
        "Smell the box.",
        "Some presents, especially candy and bath bombs, can be identified by their scent wafting through the wrapping paper.",
        "Take a sniff at the corners of the box, where there might be tiny gaps in the paper that allow smells to escape.",
        "Beware the large box.",
        "Parents are tricky\u2014often times, they will put a small box inside a larger box, especially if the shape of the small box would give up the secret of what's inside.",
        "If the box is large, but is not very heavy, you can be pretty sure it's not packed with clothing, books, or other heavier things.",
        "Some parents booby-trap presents that are already wrapped by putting them inside bigger boxes stuffed with paper, packing peanuts or other things to reduce sound when you shake them.",
        "If you can\u2019t guess what a large present is based on its size, this might be why.",
        "Truly clever parents will nest smaller boxes inside larger boxes if they catch you snooping.",
        "You'll open one box, and find another and then another.",
        "Your Big Present may actually turn out to be a gag gift, like a magic decoder ring, or some other silly stocking stuffer.",
        "Never dismiss a small box.",
        "It could turn out to be something valuable such as a mobile phone, jewelry, gift cards or even concert tickets.",
        "Dig deeper.",
        "If the paper wrapping the present is slick and shiny, you can try peeling off the taped ends.",
        "Take great caution with this, because wrapping paper tears easily.",
        "Unless you have more of the same wrapping paper, you could ruin your sleuthing expedition.",
        "Peel off one end only, if you can.",
        "If you manage to loosen up one end, you'll be able to get a peek at the sides of your present.",
        "Beware of bows and ribbons.",
        "Never remove a bow from a wrapped present, as these are practically impossible to put back on looking pristine.",
        "Put everything back where it was.",
        "Referring to your snapshots, return everything to its original position, seal up any presents you opened and have a Merry Christmas!"
