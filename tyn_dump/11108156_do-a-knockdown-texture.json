Keep the following in mind:\nIf the wall or ceiling is new, unpainted plaster or drywall, make sure the surface is as smooth as possible. If there are dents, nail holes, or other blemishes in an older wall or ceiling, patch them with spackle, sand them smooth, and prime them before proceeding. Clean older walls or ceilings with an appropriate cleanser based on the paint finish, then let them dry fully before applying a knockdown texture. Although people typically paint or repaint the wall/ceiling after applying the knockdown texture, you can also paint it an off-white color beforehand. That way, the white, unpainted texture will provide a subtle color contrast."

        "Generally speaking, you\u2019ll do the following:\nAttach the hopper (where you\u2019ll add the joint compound) to the top of the spray gun.",
        "Connect the air hose to the spray gun and the air compressor.",
        "Attach the spray nozzle to the tip of the spray gun.",
        "Mix the joint compound and water until you get a pancake batter consistency.",
        "Add 2 in (5.1 cm) of water to a 2 US gal (7.6 L) bucket, then pour in an entire 1.5 US gal (5.7 L) bucket of joint compound dry mix.",
        "Lock a paddle attachment onto a power drill and use it to stir the mixture until there are no lumps.",
        "Wait 15 minutes, then test the consistency of the mix.",
        "If it\u2019s thicker than pancake batter, mix in about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of water at a time until the consistency is right.",
        "If you\u2019re not sure what pancake batter consistency is, grab a small drywall knife and scoop up some of the mix.",
        "Tilt the knife blade slightly\u2014if the mix slides right off, it\u2019s thin enough.",
        "If you're texturing an area larger than about 150 sq ft (14 m), which is the area of the ceiling in an average room, break up the room into sections and mix up individual batches for each section.",
        "For instance, do half the ceiling in the morning, and the other half in the afternoon.",
        "You can find all of these supplies at a home improvement store.",
        "Spraying on the Texture Fill the hopper partway and set up a spray testing area.",
        "Scoop or pour the mixed joint compound into the spray gun\u2019s attached hopper until it\u2019s one-half to two-thirds full.",
        "Set up a roughly 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft (91 cm \u00d7 91 cm) piece of scrap drywall or plywood, or just practice on some of the plastic sheeting that you\u2019ve taped up in the room.",
        "Turn on the air compressor, and hold the spray gun 18 in (46 cm) from the testing surface.",
        "Read the product instructions to ensure that you know how to turn on, use, and turn off the air compressor properly.",
        "Before spraying, put on eye protection to keep overspray out of your eyes.",
        "It\u2019s also a good idea to wear a hat and long sleeves.",
        "Wear a dust mask if you\u2019re concerned about possibly breathing in overspray particles.",
        "Practice your spraying technique on the test surface.",
        "Following the spray gun\u2019s instructions, squeeze the trigger to release a loose spray of joint compound.",
        "Keep the spray gun about 18 in (46 cm) from the test surface, and wave the gun back and forth in a smooth, steady motion to ensure even coverage over the surface.",
        "Keep practicing until you\u2019ve got the \u201cfeel\u201d for spraying the right amount of the mixture.",
        "The nozzle on the spray gun is adjustable.",
        "You can make adjustments to increase or decrease the amount of spray.",
        "Your goal is to get \u201c40/60\u201d coverage.",
        "In other words, 40% of the area you spray should be covered in small, random globules of the joint compound.",
        "The other 60% of the area should still be bare.",
        "Search online for \"knockdown texture spray images\" for visual examples.",
        "Spray the texture on the wall or ceiling in 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft (91 cm \u00d7 91 cm) sections.",
        "If you\u2019re texturing the ceiling, for instance, you don\u2019t have to literally draw a grid on it.",
        "However, imagine that it\u2019s broken up into squares, and spray them one-by-one using the technique you mastered during your practice session.",
        "Work to the edges of each section as you spray, but try not to overlap the sections as you work.",
        "Otherwise, the texture will build up too much at the overlaps.",
        "If you spray while waving the gun in a smooth, steady, back-and-forth motion, it\u2019s fairly easy to coat a 3 ft \u00d7 3 ft (91 cm \u00d7 91 cm) section evenly.",
        "It may take a little longer your first time trying a knockdown texture, but you\u2019ll be able to cover an average ceiling in only 5-10 minutes with a bit of practice.",
        "Don\u2019t spray for more than 10-15 minutes before switching to using the knockdown blade.",
        "If necessary, do only one half of the ceiling or one wall at a time.",
        "Wait 10-15 minutes, or until the sprayed texture dries only slightly.",
        "Don\u2019t go straight from spraying on the texture to smoothing down its peaks with the knockdown knife.",
        "Instead, watch and wait for the wet shine on the sprayed texture to dissipate.",
        "As soon as this happens, grab your knockdown knife to finish the job.",
        "If the sprayed texture is still too wet, it will smear instead of flatten when you use the knockdown knife.",
        "If let it dry for too long, however, you won\u2019t be able to properly flatten it out with the knockdown knife.",
        "Completing the Knockdown Look Run the knockdown knife over the texture in a straight line, using light pressure.",
        "Use a knockdown knife with an 18 in (46 cm) rubber blade for this job.",
        "Attach an extension pole to the handle if you need it to extend your reach, then lay the rubber blade flat at one end or corner of the surface area you just textured.",
        "Apply gentle, even pressure, and drag the knife in a completely straight line across the surface, stopping about 2 ft (61 cm) away from the other end or corner.",
        "If you\u2019re texturing a wall, start at the top corner of the wall where it meets the ceiling,  drag the knockdown knife straight down until it\u2019s about 2 ft (61 cm) from the floor, then lift it away.",
        "Light, even pressure will flatten out the peaks of the globules of texture on the wall, but it won\u2019t smear them into each other.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about your technique here, practice on a scrap piece of drywall or plywood first.",
        "You can find a knockdown knife at a home improvement store, likely near the joint compound mixes.",
        "It looks like a large squeegee.",
        "Wipe off the knockdown knife blade after every stroke.",
        "Dampen a rag in some clean water and run it over the rubber blade of the knockdown knife to wipe away the excess joint compound that you scraped off the textured area.",
        "Do this every time you pull the blade from the wall or ceiling, so that the knockdown knife is clean for each pass over the textured area.",
        "Keep a stack of damp rags handy so you can wipe off the blade quickly and easily.",
        "Work in from the opposite edge to complete your first row of knockdown.",
        "With your first stroke, you started at one end and \u201cknocked-down\u201d a straight line until you were 2 ft (61 cm) from the other end of the textured area.",
        "Now, start at that other end and finish knocking down that remaining 2 ft (61 cm).",
        "Ease off the pressure on the blade as you meet your previous endpoint, so that these two passes of the knockdown knife blend seamlessly.",
        "Continue to smooth the texture in straight rows with minimal overlap.",
        "Set your knockdown knife in position right next to your original starting point, with 3 in (7.6 cm) or less of overlap.",
        "Drag it across the textured area in a parallel straight line, using the same technique as before.",
        "Repeat this process row-by-row until you\u2019ve knocked down the entire textured area.",
        "Work at a brisk pace.",
        "You\u2019ll have about 10-15 minutes until the texture dries too much to be easily smoothed over.",
        "Keep your smoothing lines as straight as possible.",
        "Go straight over any taped-over openings for electrical outlets, fixtures, or switches.",
        "Create curved lines around permanent obstacles only when absolutely necessary.",
        "Let the texture dry overnight before cleaning up the room.",
        "The knockdown texture may be dried and set in only a few hours, but it\u2019s best to give it at least 8 hours.",
        "After that, you can remove all the plastic sheeting, painter\u2019s tape, and drop cloths in the room, and put all the electric fixtures and cover plates back in place.",
        "Wait at least 3 days, and ideally a week, before placing any furniture right against a wall you just textured, or hanging anything (like a mirror or framed artwork) on it.",
        "Likewise, wait 3 days to a week before painting the textured surface, if you intend to paint it."
