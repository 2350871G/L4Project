If you're just feeding small birds, you can choose one that has a cage around the feeder. The holes are small enough for the birds to fit through, but the squirrels can't squeeze through.

        "When the squirrel tries to climb the pole, it will grab the slinky.",
        "The slinky will slide down, landing the squirrel back on the ground.",
        "Some squirrels learn to outsmart this trick, though.",
        "Rub the pole with shortening or petroleum jelly to make it unclimbable.",
        "Often, the squirrel won't even attempt to climb the pole because it feels sticky.",
        "However, if a squirrel does try to climb it, it will just slide back down the pole.",
        "Spike your birdseed with cayenne pepper so the squirrels won't like it.",
        "Sprinkle cayenne pepper flakes or powder into the birdseed, making sure to get it all through the seed.",
        "Birds can't taste the heat of this spice, as they don't have the receptors.",
        "However, squirrels can, and they don't like it.",
        "They may get into your birdseed a few times, but they'll soon learn that it doesn't taste good.",
        "You can also use safflower seeds for the birds instead of regular bird feed, as squirrels don't like these seeds.",
        "Keeping Squirrels out of the House Fill in any holes in the attic to keep squirrels from getting inside.",
        "Go into your attic to look for holes along the inside.",
        "It's best to do this in daylight so you can see the sun shining through.",
        "Nail mesh wire over any holes you find to keep squirrels from coming in.",
        "If you don't want to do this yourself, hire a contractor or repair person to do it.",
        "Purchase a chimney cap for your fireplace to block an entrance for squirrels.",
        "Some squirrels will simply crawl down the chimney to get into your house!",
        "If that's the case, a chimney cap is a solution.",
        "It closes off the chimney so the squirrels can't enter.",
        "However, part of the cap is made from a wire cage, so the smoke will still be able to get out.",
        "Cut branches off that hang near the house so squirrels can't jump to the roof.",
        "If a branch hangs near your roof, slice it off so there's at least 6 feet (1.8 m) between the branch and the house.",
        "Similarly, chop off any branches that hang over your roof that a squirrel can use as a bridge.",
        "If a squirrel can use a branch to get over to your home, they'll do it.",
        "Once on your roof, they'll often look for ways to get in, and soon enough, you'll have an infestation.",
        "Use a live trap if squirrels do get in the attic.",
        "Place the trap in the attic with something tasty squirrels like, such as nuts or dried fruit.",
        "Once the trap is full, make sure to fill in any holes in the attic before releasing the squirrel outside.",
        "If you leave the squirrels in the attic when you close up the holes, you could end up with an awful smell.",
        "Call a wildlife expert to remove the squirrels.",
        "If you have an infestation, it's best to get help.",
        "They can trap the squirrels for you and help you find and fill in the holes in your house.",
        "That way, you can be sure they won't get back in."
