Double check your measurements before you start marking your cuts. Ensure your math and calculations are correct so that you don\u2019t waste your time and materials cutting risers that don\u2019t fit. It\u2019s better to take a few minutes to double check yourself than to waste a whole lot of time redoing your work. Marking Your Cuts Start laying out the first stair. Place a framing square near the end of a 2 x 12 (38 x 286 mm) board, leaving a few inches at the end before the end of the square. Use the individual rise and run figures marked on the outside scales of the square that matches your desired measurements. These figures should touch the upper edge of your board. The short end of the square (tongue) should be on the rise measurement. The long end of the square (body) should be on the run measurement. The board should be at least 12 inches (30.48cm) longer than the planned length of the stringer, just to give yourself some play. Mark the outline along the square's outer edges. Move the square down to extend the run line to the lower board edge, if necessary. This is the outline of your top stair. Lay out the rest of the stairs. Slide the framing square along the board so your scale run figure touches the end of your first marked run line. Double check that your rise and run figures are lines up with the top edge of the board and then mark your second stair. Continue down the board, making sure to line up the scale's rise and run figure at the top edge. Mark the new outline and repeat until you have marked 1 extra pair of runs and rises. Mark the bottom of the stringer. In order to make the first step the same height as the others, you need to subtract the depth of the thread from the rise, so the finished stair is still 7 inches (18 cm). Simply make another mark to the right of the run line that is parallel and equal to the thickness of the thread. This marks the stringer bottom. Making Your Cuts Prepare to use a circular saw safely. Put on your personal protective equipment, including safety glasses. It's also important to use general safety precautions when using a circular saw. These include keeping your body parts away from the blade while the tool is running and being sure that the cord is out of the path of the tool as it's running. You should also clamp down your stringer board, so that it doesn\u2019t move while you cut it. Cut down the lines you marked on the stringer with a circular saw. Start the saw running before it makes contact with the wood. Then slowly work the saw in from the outer edge of the mark towards where it ends, where the rise and run meet. Leave about .5 inches (1.3 cm) of the line uncut, which you will finish with a hand saw. Finish your cuts with a handsaw. Cutting beyond where the rise and run lines meet can severely weaken your structure. Instead of accidently going too far with the circular saw, choose to finish your cuts with a handsaw so that you can be exact. Trim the bottom and top of the stringer. Cut the top of the stringer along the first rise line. Then trim the bottom run line, which was marked so that it is shorter than the others by an amount equal to the thread thickness of your stairs. Use the first finished stringer as a template. Use this one as a stringer template for all of your other stringers so they all match exactly. In most cases, you will need only 1 or 2 more stringers, although a very wide stairway could require more.",
