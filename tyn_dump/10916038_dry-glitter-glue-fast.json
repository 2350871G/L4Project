Drying Glitter Glue with a Fan Secure your project on a surface. When you use a fan to dry glitter glue, you want to make sure that your project won\u2019t blow away before you begin. Use paperweights to weigh down your project on a table. You can also pin up your project on a clothesline with clothespins, or use magnets to stick your project to the side of a refrigerator.

Drying Glitter Glue Under the Sun Lay your project on a sunny spot in front of a window. The heat from the sun will help to evaporate the water out of the glue and dry it. Try to find a space that will get continuous sun for at least twenty minutes. Open the window to let the breeze blow on the glitter glue. This will also help the glue to dry more quickly. But only do this if it is dry and breezy out, and make sure to keep the window closed if it the weather is damp or rainy. Wait for twenty minutes. Go and work on something else as you wait for this method to dry the glitter glue.
