The exact amount of tobacco required will depend on the size of the wrap and personal preference, but three-grams is the average. Many smokers prefer a slower burning cigarillo. To roll a cigarillo that burns slower, use more tobacco and pack it densely. Unroll your cigarillo wrap. When cigarillo wraps are packaged at the factory, they are rolled around a soft plastic tube that protects them from any unwanted creasing or folding that can occur during transit. If this is your first attempt rolling a cigarillo, you may want to consider purchasing a couple of wraps since they are delicate and can tear easily. Cigarillo wraps can be purchased at your local tobacco specialty shop, convenience store, or gas station. A cigar can be gutted and used as a cigarillo wrap. Place the wrap on a flat and stable surface. Be sure to place the wrap down so that it's curl faces upward. This curl will help hold the tobacco in place while you roll. If the wrap lies flat, you can curl it yourself using a pencil or pen. Fill the wrap with tobacco. Using your thumb, index, and middle fingers, sprinkle the tobacco evenly throughout the wrap. Do your best to make sure that the tobacco is equally distributed, otherwise, the cigarillo may burn unevenly. Be careful not to overfill the wrap, or you won't be able to seal it properly.

The exact amount will be determined by the size of your wrap and personal preference. Hand rollers come in several different cigarette, cigarillo, and cigar sizes.
