Position a can of compressed air at the hinge of your MacBook Air, where the screen and the keyboard are connected. Lightly spray compressed air along the hinge to help clear dust out of the fan. It\u2019s difficult to reach the fan of a MacBook Air if you want a more thorough clean, as it involves taking apart the computer which isn\u2019t recommended. Take your MacBook Air to a professional if you want the fan to be properly cleaned from the inside. Be careful to not spray the compressed air with too much pressure. This is because it could loosen a component within the computer."

Before you begin any cleaning on your MacBook Air, it\u2019s important to shut it down completely so that you are able to press on the keyboard and trackpad.

Cleaning the Keyboard and Trackpad Clean the keyboard and trackpad using bleach-free disinfectant wipes. Disinfect each individual key and its surrounding casing using a disinfectant wipe. Then wipe the trackpad with a disinfectant wipe too. The keyboard and trackpad are generally the part of a laptop that harbors the most bacteria, so it is important to disinfect these parts regularly.

Keeping Your MacBook Air Clean Invest in a case for your MacBook Air to help keep the exterior clean. A protective case or sleeve will help to protect the exterior of your laptop from scratches and dust. This is a worthwhile investment which will help to protect your MacBook Air for years to come. Using a protective case or sleeve is especially important if you regularly carry your laptop around with you or if you keep it in your bag. Use a screen protector to keep the screen free of smudges. If you find that your screen often gets smudges or fingerprint marks, apply a screen protector so that the smudges are only on the protector rather than the screen itself. A screen protector is also a good idea if you are concerned about the screen getting scratched. Screen protectors are easy to use. They simply stick directly onto the screen. Get a keyboard cover to protect the keys from dust and food particles. Place a cover over your MacBook Air keyboard to prevent particles from becoming lodged in the keys and affecting the performance of your laptop. Keyboard covers can be easily cleaned using soapy water, before being dried and then reapplied to the keyboard. Keyboard covers can also help to protect your laptop from spilled liquids entering the machine through the keys. Wash your hands after eating to avoid getting crumbs on your computer.
