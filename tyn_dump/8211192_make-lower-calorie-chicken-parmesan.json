Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands, cutting board, knife, and any other items that come into contact with the raw chicken to avoid spreading bacteria throughout your kitchen. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Once the chicken is cut into smaller cutlets, season them with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Be sure to flip the cutlets over so you can season both sides. Coating the Chicken Combine the breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. In a shallow bowl, mix together \u00bd cup (63 g) of the breadcrumbs you made earlier, 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated Parmesan cheese, \u00bc teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder, and \u00bd teaspoon (1 g) of Italian seasoning.

Just make sure that the item you use isn\u2019t so flimsy that it leaves bits of paper behind on the chicken. Dredge the chicken in the breadcrumb mixture. Once the chicken is covered with the butter and oil mixture, press the cutlets into the breadcrumb mixture. Make sure to coat both sides of the chicken, and shake off the excess. Place the chicken on the baking sheet and mist with oil. When the chicken is coated with the breadcrumb mixture, set the cutlets on the greased baking sheet. Use an oil mister to lightly mist the top of the chicken with olive oil. If you want to cut calories even further, you don\u2019t have to mist the chicken with the oil. However, keep in mind that the finished chicken may not be as golden or crispy if you don\u2019t. Bake the chicken until golden brown.
