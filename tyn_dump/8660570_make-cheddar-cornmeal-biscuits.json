    "text": " Prepping Your Workspace Position the oven rack. Before turning on the oven, you will need to make sure the oven rack is in the appropriate position. Place the oven rack in the center of the oven. Preheat the oven. Turn the oven on to 425 degrees Fahrenheit or 218 degrees Celsius. Make sure that the oven is completely preheated before you bake the biscuits. Flour a clean work surface. You will be rolling out the biscuits on a lightly floured surface, such as a countertop or table. Wipe the surface clean and wait for it to dry. Once it is dry, take several pinches of flour and lightly sprinkle them on top of the surface. Making the Dough Cook the onions. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat in a nonstick skillet. Place the green onions in the skillet and saute them until they become slightly soft. This should take about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat. If you do not want green onions in your biscuits, you can omit this step. Blend the dry ingredients. Measure the baking soda, baking powder, salt, sugar, cornmeal, and flour and put them in the bowl of a food processor. Blend the ingredients in the food processor until they are just combined. If you do not have a food processor, you can blend them together by stirring with a wooden spoon. Add the butter. Add \u00bd cup (150 grams) chilled butter to the food processor bowl. Using the pulse button on the food processor, cut the butter into flour mixture until the ingredients look like a coarse meal. If you are not using a food processor, you can cut the butter by hand using two knives. Add the cheese.

Pulse several times until the cheese is just combined with the rest of the ingredients. If not using a food processor, simply stir the cheese into the dough by hand using a wooden spoon. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Once the cheese is combined with the rest of the ingredients, transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl. Any type of mixing bowl is suitable, such as a plastic, stainless steel, enamel, or glass bowl. Combine the egg and buttermilk. Crack the egg and place it in a large glass measuring cup. Whisk the egg. Pour buttermilk into the measuring cup until it reaches the 1 cup (240 mL) line. Whisk the buttermilk and egg together. Add the green onions and chipotle. Once you have whisked the buttermilk and egg together, you will add additional ingredients to the glass measuring cup. Add the green onions and chipotles to the egg mixture and stir. Omit the chipotle and green onions if you do not want them in your biscuits. Make a well in the center of the dough mixture. Take your hands and make a fist-sized indentation in the middle of the dough mixture. Pour the egg and buttermilk mixture into the well. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until the dough mixture is evenly moistened by the milk and egg. Crafting the Biscuits Knead the dough. Turn the dough out on to a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough until it just holds together, or about ten times. Pat the dough into a \u00be inch or 2 centimeter thick round. Once you are done kneading the dough, pat it out on the generously floured surface. You should end up with a circular shape that is about \u00be inch or 2 centimeters thick. Make sure the dough\u2019s thickness is as uniform as possible. Cut the biscuits. To cut the biscuits, you will need a 3 inch or 7.5 centimeter cookie cutter. If you do not have a cookie cutter, you can use a glass or cup instead. Use the cutter, cup, or glass to cut the biscuits. Transfer them to an ungreased cookie sheet, spacing them about 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters apart.
