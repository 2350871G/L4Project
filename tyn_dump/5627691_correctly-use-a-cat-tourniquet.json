        "For slight injuries or bleeding, apply pressure to the wound and a bandage before using a tourniquet.",
        "If the bleeding does not stop, place a bandage on the wound.",
        "If it still does not stop, then you may use a tourniquet.",
        "Always remove the tourniquet if it has been on the wound for more than two hours.",
        "Prolonged use of a CAT can lead to nerve damage.",
        "If the injured person\u2019s leg or arm was amputated, do not remove or loosen the tourniquet.",
        "Amputation in the legs or arms may cause massive bleeding, so the tourniquet should remain in place.",
        "Understand that CATs are painful to apply.",
        "While pain may vary from individual to individual, tourniquets will cause a level pain in the area.",
        "This could be a sharp, dull, throbbing or excruciating pain.",
        "As well, the longer the tourniquet is on, the more intense the pain becomes.",
        "Use cheaper, alternative material if you don\u2019t have access or can\u2019t afford a CAT.",
        "Though tourniquets are easy to use and reusable, they are not cheap.",
        "The estimated cost of a CAT is about $25.",
        "So if you don\u2019t want to spend money on a CAT or are in a situation where a CAT is not readily available, you can use alternative or cheaper material like a rope, a cloth, or an elastic bandage.",
        "Practice using a CAT on yourself.",
        "The most effective way to learn how to correctly apply a tourniquet is to try it on yourself first.",
        "Studies have shown that the incorrect use of the Combat Application Tourniquet can cause death.",
        "So, proper placement and use of the tourniquet is essential to prevent blood loss and death.",
        "Take precautions when practicing since this procedure will cut the blood to your extremities.",
        "Do not keep the tourniquet in place for a long time.",
        "If you feel any numbness on the practice area, remove the tourniquet."
