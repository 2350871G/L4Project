Glue a paper plate so \u00bc of it hangs over a side of the wire and the other \u00be rests slightly on the lip of the bucket. Scoop a spoonful of peanut butter on the side of the plate closest to the wire. Make a ramp leading up to the plate using a plank of wood. The mice will try to climb on the plate to get to the peanut butter, but will fall in instead. Leave the bucket out for a few days at a time to catch multiple mice. Mice caught outdoors are usually field mice, or voles. Field mice can live up to 4 years.Tip: Punch a hole in the bottom of a soda can and feed the wire through the can. Put a layer of peanut butter on one side of the can. As the mice climb to get the peanut butter, the can will spin and they'll fall into the bucket."
