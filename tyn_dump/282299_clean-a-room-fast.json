        "Kathi Burns, CPO\u00ae\t\t\tBoard Certified Professional Organizer\t\t\t\tOur Expert Agrees: Start the cleaning process by clearing and organizing your piles.",
        "Piles magically grow larger the longer we leave them.",
        "If you only have 15 or even 30 minutes to clean your room, tackle your piles and focus on the areas that are bothering you the most.",
        "Cleaning the Room Clean surfaces of hard-to-remove dirt and grime.",
        "If you\u2019ve got a kitchen table, TV trays, or a counter where you eat, or anything like that, you need to get a rag and some soap, depending on the surface, and wipe it clean.",
        "Most surfaces will clean with a wet rag, but sometimes you\u2019ll need to bring in the big guns.",
        "But remember:\nUse appropriate chemicals for appropriate surfaces.",
        "You don\u2019t want to ruin hardwood furniture with abrasive chemicals.",
        "Try to use a microfiber towel when you can.",
        "Stick to water and a little soap when and where you can.",
        "Dust the room.",
        "Dusting will give your room a much cleaner appearance, and help improve the air quality.",
        "It is one of the most important elements of keeping a clean house.",
        "Depending on how much time you have, you can choose the extent in which you will dust.",
        "Consider:\nUse microfiber towels when you can.",
        "Dusting the surfaces of furniture, like desks, a TV stand, bookshelves, and more.",
        "Dust ceiling fans.",
        "Dust and remove cobwebs from crown molding.",
        "Wipe down the surfaces of electronics with microfiber towels.",
        "Vacuum the room, if you\u2019ve got carpet or if you want to vacuum your tile/hardwood.",
        "Now that your surfaces are clean and better organized and your floor is clear, it\u2019s time to vacuum.",
        "Vacuuming will help remove dirty, dust, and dog or cat hair from the room.",
        "It is an essential part of any clean.",
        "Most rooms can be vacuumed in under five minutes, if you\u2019re in a hurry.",
        "Start at the back of the room and systematically move toward the entrance.",
        "Make sure to vacuum along the baseboards, behind and under couches and other furniture.",
        "Vacuum couches, chairs, and loveseats if appropriate.",
        "Be careful though, try to avoid damaging delicate fabrics.",
        "If you\u2019re going to spend a little bit more time, try to vacuum over an area 3 or 4 times.",
        "Mop the room, if you\u2019ve got tile or hardwood.",
        "Mopping is essential in removing dirty and grime from your floor, and all you need is some soap and a bucket.",
        "This is a must, so you won\u2019t want to skip it.",
        "But, if you\u2019re in a hurry, there are a few ways to save time: \nIf you want to save time, invest in a swifter or something similar.",
        "Another way to save time is to get a wet soapy towel, and to walk around the room with it.",
        "This won\u2019t be as effective as actual mopping, but you\u2019ll be able to pick up a lot of dirt and grime and save time.",
        "If mopping the old fashion way, make sure to sweep the floor first.",
        "Sweep from the back of the room toward the entrance, working systematically, and picking up your dirt/debris piles as you move toward the entrance.",
        "After sweeping, start mopping from the back of the room toward the front.",
        "Mop 3x3 or 4x4 foot sections and then rinse your mop with fresh water.",
        "Slowly and systematically move toward the entrance of the room.",
        "Look around the room.",
        "After you've mopped, make sure to take a good look around the room and make some final adjustments if you need to.",
        "This is your chance to spend a couple minutes getting to the little things you might have neglected because you were in a hurry.",
        "Also, there are some finishing touches that will help your room look and smell clean:\nOpen the windows to let fresh air in.",
        "Turn on the fan, this will help the floor dry and will spread the clean air from outside around your home.",
        "Consider lighting a candle.",
        "If you're confident in how clean the room is, open the blinds and let some more light in."
