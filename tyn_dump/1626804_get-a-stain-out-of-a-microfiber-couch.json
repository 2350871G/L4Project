Water that has soaked into microfiber fabric often causes a darkening of that area. Work the rubbing alcohol gently into that area. Food Stain Removal Soak up excess liquid with white paper towels immediately after the stain was created.  Put a drop of hand dish washing soap, like Dawn, on a white cloth.  Pour 1 drop of water on the liquid to activate it.  Rub gently on the microfiber food stain until it is removed. This should work on oil-based food. Do not use this process on microfiber couches that indicate \"S\" on their care tag. This means no water-based solvents should be used. Smell Removal Sprinkle baking soda on the stain.  Let it sit for 5 minutes to soak up any liquid.  Vacuum up the soiled baking soda.  Reapply baking soda if the spill or smell remains. This method should work for urine stains. Use a solvent in addition if the stain is not completely removed. Gum Removal Wrap ice cubes in a plastic bag.  Apply the cold bag to the gum until it hardens.  Tug at the gum from the corners. Try to pull it off in 1 piece. Reapply the ice if the gum is not fully hardened.  Finished. ",
