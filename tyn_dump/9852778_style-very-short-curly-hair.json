        "Mist your hair with a heat protectant before you curl it.",
        "Finish off with a shine serum or spray.",
        "This will help keep your curls looking smooth and glossy throughout the day.",

        "Getting a Flattering Cut Cut your hair in layers to help distribute the volume.",
        "When it comes to hair, different people have different ideas of what's \"short\" and what's \"very short.\"",
        "If your idea of \"very short\" is something that's between pixie and bob-length, get some light layers to help distribute the volume--otherwise you might end up with a puff!",
        "If your hair is cropped short, you don't have to worry about layers.",
        "It doesn't need much volume control.",
        "Consider a classic pixie if you want something more edgy.",
        "For even better results, consider getting a graduated pixie, where it is a little longer on the top than on the sides.",
        "Don't go for a precise cut; leave it coarse and choppy.",
        "Try a sculpted pixie cut if you want to bring dimension to your face.",
        "A sculpted pixie cut is similar to the classic pixie, except that it is cropped short on the sides and left longer at top.",
        "This is a great option for those who are transitioning from long-to-short hair (or vice versa), or for those who are treating their hair for heat damage.",
        "Try a TWA or teeny-weeny afro if you have natural or African hair.",
        "This is a versatile hairstyle that is easy to style and take care of.",
        "It is perfect for those with natural or African hair and is a great alternative to doing protective styles, such as cornrows."
