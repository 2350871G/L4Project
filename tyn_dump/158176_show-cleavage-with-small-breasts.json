Try twisting the front of your bra, clipping the back two straps together, or even wearing two bras to create some cleavage. Twist the small piece of material between the cups once, and then put the bra on as you normally would. The small twist will bring the cups closer together and give you some cleavage. Use a safety pin or hair tie to fasten the two back straps of your bra together towards the top of your back. This will create a sort of halter in front, lifting your breasts and bringing them closer together. Wear two bras for extra volume and lift in your chest. The first bra you put on should push your breasts together (try the twisting technique if you don\u2019t have a bra that naturally does this). The second bra should be one that provides lift, like a push-up bra. Two bras may seem like a bit much at first, but you\u2019ll get accustomed to the feeling, and they will do the trick."
