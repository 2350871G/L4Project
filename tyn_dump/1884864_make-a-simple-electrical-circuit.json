To install the switch, you will need 3 pieces of wire instead of 2 as well as a simple switch. Once you strip the wires and get them attached to the battery pack you can proceed to install the switch. Install the switch. Take the exposed metal end of one of the wires from the battery pack and bend it into a U-shape. Loosen the screw on the switch and slip the U-shape of the wire underneath. Tighten the screw making sure that the metal of the wire remains in contact with the screw. Attach the extra third wire to the switch. Bend each of the metal ends of the wire into a U-shape. Slip the U-shape under the second screw of the switch to attach it. Tighten the screw ensuring the metal of the screw stays in contact with the metal of the wire. Hook up the light bulb.
