You\u2019ll obviously want yellow paint for the flowers\u2019 petals, but it helps to have several different shades available so you can shade them to add dimension. For the center of the flower, you\u2019ll need a couple of shades of brown paint. You should also have at least one shade of green for the stem and leaves. You can use whatever type of paint you prefer for painting; both oil and acrylics work well for painting on a canvas. Don\u2019t forget the background of your painting. If you\u2019re painting the sunflowers in an outdoor setting, you\u2019ll need blue to fill in the sky or green to represent grass and other plants. For an indoor setting, you\u2019ll want a background shade for the wall. It\u2019s a good idea to keep white and black paint on hand. That way, you can lighten and darken up the yellow, brown, and green paints that you have to create additional shades for the painting."

        "When you\u2019re happy with the sunflower that you\u2019ve drawn, you can decide whether you want to paint additional flowers.",
        "You can use the same techniques to draw them as you did for the original flower, though you\u2019ll need to vary the size and the direction that they\u2019re facing.",
        "Adding some in the foreground and others in the background can help give the finished painting more dimension.",
        "Keep in mind that background flowers will be smaller than the original flower, while those in the foreground should appear larger.",
        "You don\u2019t have to add complete flowers.",
        "You can just sketch in top, bottom, or side of a sunflower to help fill out the painting.",
        "Painting the Sunflowers Transfer your sketch to the canvas.",
        "Once you\u2019ve finished your sketch of the sunflower(s), you need to transfer it to the canvas before you begin painting.",
        "The best way to transfer the sketch is with artist\u2019s transfer paper, which is coated with graphite that transfers to the canvas when you trace over it.",
        "Take a piece of transfer paper that the same size as your drawing, and tape it to the canvas, with the graphite side face down.",
        "Place the drawing on top of the transfer paper, and trace it onto the canvas with a pencil.",
        "It\u2019s best to use artist\u2019s archival tape to attach the transfer paper and drawing to the canvas because it is easy to remove and doesn\u2019t leave any residue behind.",
        "Make sure that you position your transfer paper and drawing on the canvas in the exact spot that you want to paint your sunflowers.",
        "A mechanical pencil usually works best for tracing the drawing because you don\u2019t have to worry about the point getting dull.",
        "Paint the  background first.",
        "After you transfer the drawing to the canvas as a guide for your painting, start by painting the background behind the flowers first.",
        "You can use the larger brush to fill in most of it, but take care around the flowers and other items that you might have included in the drawing, such as a vase.",
        "Around those areas, you may want to switch to a smaller brush.",
        "If you\u2019re using multiple colors of paint to get the right shade for the background, you can usually mix them directly on the canvas.",
        "However, if you\u2019re making a drastic change, such as taking a color extremely dark or extremely light, you may want to mix the paint on a palette first so you can be sure to get the right color.",
        "Fill in the petals and center with a base color.",
        "With your smallest brush, start filling in the petals around your sunflower(s).",
        "In most cases, it\u2019s best to start with your brightest yellow shade for this step.",
        "Next, use a similarly sized brush to fill in the center of the sunflower with a brown shade.",
        "Just as with the yellow, it\u2019s best to start with a lighter brown or tan color.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a yellow or brown shade in acrylic paint that is light or bright enough to use as a base color, thinning a darker color with water can help lighten it.",
        "With oil or acrylic paint, you can mix in some white to lighten the yellow and brown shades.",
        "Shade the petals and centers.",
        "To give your painting dimension, you\u2019ll want to incorporate other shades of yellow on the petals.",
        "Shade some areas with mid-tone and dark yellows so the petals don\u2019t look as flat.",
        "Do the same with the sunflower\u2019s center by working in mid-tone dark shades of brown.",
        "To decide where to use the darker shades, consider where the light would hit the flowers and where shadows might fall.",
        "Depending on the look that you\u2019re going for, you may also want to incorporate subtle touches of red and orange paint in the petals\u2019 shading.",
        "You can also use a small amount of white on the petals to act as a highlight.",
        "For the center, you may want to have some black paint on hand to darken certain areas.",
        "Finish the stem and leaves.",
        "The final step for your sunflower painting is to fill in the stems and leaves.",
        "You usually want at least two shades of green: a brighter green and a darker forest green shade.",
        "Use your smaller brush to fill in the stems and leaves to keep your strokes more precise."
