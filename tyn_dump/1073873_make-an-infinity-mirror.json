Glass is not reflective, so you need to put a reflective film over it so that it is just slightly transparent. When the LED lights bounce back and forth between the two-way mirror and the regular mirror, you get the fascinating infinity effect. You can find the reflective film at any craft store or online. You can also use car window tint film from an auto parts store."
