If your vines tend to flower in the summer or autumn months, set aside time in early spring to cut them back. Certain vines, like honeysuckle or wisteria, grow faster than others, so you may need to prune regularly if you have certain vines on your gate or fence. For example, American bittersweet vines need to be pruned in late winter, while bougainvilleas need to be pruned throughout the year."

Cut along the ends of your thin vines to reduce bulk. Repeat this process along each individual vine until the plant is no longer tangled and overgrown. If your vines still look a little worse for wear, consider cutting off an additional 2 ft (61 cm). This process works well for vines like star jasmine. Use your best judgment while you prune.

If your vines look a bit worse for wear, use a rotary lawn mower or pair of handheld shears to trim them by at least 4 in (10 cm). Try cutting the vines at around a 45-degree angle so the ends of the vines can heal more quickly. Try to cut the same amount off each vine so the vegetation all looks uniform. Make sure your shears are sharp, or else your final pruning job might look sloppy. Avoid trimming wisterias in the off-season, as they tend to grow back pretty rapidly."
