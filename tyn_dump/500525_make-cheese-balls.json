        "Continue this process until the entire cheese ball is covered.",
        "Alternatively, you can roll the cheese ball over a layer of the crushed pecans to coat it, but this will require more pecans to properly coat it.",
        "This is because the weight of the cheese ball will press the pecans inside rather than just coat it.",
        "Plate the cheese ball and serve it with an assortment of dipping items.",
        "Center the cheese ball on the plate.",
        "Then, surround the plate with crackers, pretzels, bread sticks, or tortilla chips for people to use as dipping items.",
        "If you have multiple dipping items, then divide them into smaller bowls that surround your cheese ball plate.",
        "If your cheese ball seems soft, cover it with plastic wrap and allow it to firm up in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.",
        "Store leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.",
        "Place your leftover cheese ball into a container that has a lid with a tight seal.",
        "Then, put the container in the refrigerator and enjoy eating the cheese ball over the next 2 weeks.",
        "Baking Mini-Cheese Balls Pour 2 cups (250 g) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese into a mixing bowl.",
        "Break up any large clumps of the shredded cheese with your fingers.",
        "This will help the flour coat the cheese better when creating the dough.",
        "The cheese can be shredded fine or thick, but should not be stuck together or frozen.",
        "Experiment with different cheese types or mix some together to create different flavor pairings.",
        "Give the cheese balls an extra bite by mixing together 1 cup (125 g) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and shredded Swiss cheese.",
        "Alternatively, add some spice to the cheese balls by mixing together 1 cup (125 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese and pepper jack cheese.",
        "Mix in 1 1/4 cups (150 g) of all-purpose flour into the mixing bowl.",
        "Use a rubber spatula to stir in the flour as you sprinkle it into the bowl.",
        "Continue mixing the cheese and flour until both ingredients are blended.",
        "If your flour has a lot of lumps in it, run it through a sieve before adding it into the bowl with the cheese.",
        "Add seasonings to the flour before mixing it in with the cheese to elevate the flavor of the finished cheese balls.",
        "Consider mixing in 1/4 tsp (1.25 g) of salt, freshly ground black pepper or paprika to the flour.",
        "Microwave 1/2 cup (225 g) of butter for 20 seconds to melt it.",
        "Put the butter into a microwavable container, and crack the lid on top of the container.",
        "This will allow the butter to aerate as it melts and keep it from spattering.",
        "Microwave the butter for 20 seconds or until it is completely melted.",
        "If you do not want to use butter, you can substitute it with equal amounts of margarine.",
        "Stir the melted butter into the flour and cheese mixture to make the dough.",
        "Pour the butter into the bowl with the flour and cheese.",
        "Use a rubber spatula to thoroughly blend the butter into the mixture.",
        "When mixed, the dough should be dense and moist.",
        "Mix the dough with your hands if needed to finish blending the ingredients together.",
        "Add 1  tsp (4.9 mL) of water to the dough if it seems crumbly.",
        "This may especially be needed if you added diced vegetables or meat to the dough.",
        "Experiment with flavors by adding diced vegetables or cooked meat.",
        "Add a finely diced vegetable or shredded meat to the cheese and flour mixture to give the light appetizer a hearty texture.",
        "Refrain from picking more than 1 additional ingredient to keep the finished dough from becoming crumbly.",
        "For example, make breaded chicken cheese balls with a sweet chili sauce.",
        "Create the dough by mixing 3 shredded cooked chicken breasts, 1 cup (125 g) shredded mozzarella cheese, 3\u20134 US tbsp (44\u201359 mL) of mayonnaise, 2 US tbsp (30 mL) of sweet chili sauce, and 1 egg.",
        "Then, roll the dough into ball and coat with an egg wash, flour, and breadcrumbs.",
        "Substitute the flour for crunchy panko breadcrumbs and make a pan of broccoli cheese balls.",
        "Create the dough by mixing together 1 cup (125 g) panko breadcrumbs, 2 cups (312 g) chopped steamed broccoli, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup (93.75 g) of shredded cheddar cheese, and 1/4 tsp (1.25 g) of salt and black pepper.",
        "Then, consider adding 2 cloves of minced garlic and scallions to round out the flavors.",
        "Place marble-sized balls of dough onto an ungreased baking sheet.",
        "Break off a small piece of dough that is roughly the size of a marble and roll it with your hands.",
        "Place the ball of dough onto the baking sheet.",
        "Leave 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of space between each row and column of dough balls.",
        "To make the process move faster, use a teaspoon as a small scoop to break off pieces of dough that are the same size.",
        "If you did not add additional vegetables or meat to your dough, consider stuffing the cheese balls as you roll them.",
        "For example, take your portioned piece of dough and wrap it evenly around a pimento-stuffed olive or a small dice of cooked chicken.",
        "Cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 1 hour.",
        "Maintain the shape of the cheese ball by chilling the dough in the refrigerator before baking.",
        "This will give the handled dough a chance to firm and will keep it from spreading or flattening in the oven.",
        "Bake the chilled cheese balls in the oven at 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C) for 15 minutes.",
        "Check on the cheese balls after the 15 minutes.",
        "The tops of the cheese balls should have a light, golden-brown coloring.",
        "If the cheese balls still appear doughy or pale, continuing baking them for another 5 minutes.",
        "Arrange the cheese balls on a platter and serve immediately.",
        "Create a single layer of cheese balls on a platter to keep them from getting soggy as they cool.",
        "Just be careful when eating the cheese balls after they come out of the oven, as they may still be very hot.",
        "Store leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week."
