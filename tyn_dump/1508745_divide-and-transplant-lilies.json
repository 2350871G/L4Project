That way, your lily will have room to grow and it will be deep enough for it to stay safe through the winter. If you\u2019re transplanting daylilies, then dig your hole so it\u2019s 3 inches (7.6 cm) deeper than the height of the bulb. Amend the soil with 2 in (5.1 cm) of compost.

Transplanting Lilies in Containers Get a pot that\u2019s at least 3-4 times the height of the largest bulb.

        "Look for a pot that\u2019s at least 2-3 times wider than the bulb\u2019s diameter and that\u2019s 3-4 times the height to ensure you\u2019re planting the bulbs low enough.",
        "Make sure the pot has drainage holes so water doesn\u2019t sit in the soil for too long or cause your bulbs to rot.",
        "Plan to get 1 pot for every 3-5 bulbs you have.",

        "You can use things like organic garden compost, food scraps, or a packaged perlite mixture.",
        "Place 3-5 bulbs \u20442 in (1.3 cm) apart in the compost so the pointed ends face up.",
        "Set the bulbs about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge of the pot in a circular pattern.",
        "Leave about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) between each bulb so they have time to grow without getting too crowded.",
        "Make sure the pointed ends of the bulbs are face up or else your plant won\u2019t grow.Tip: Use the largest bulbs in your pots if you want blooms during the next growing season.",
