Learn that position. If you can, (put the marker barrel-down) and try to estimate where the shot would hit before you even bring up your marker. Quickly bring up your marker into firing position.

There are market triggers available for almost all guns. (This will only work for markers with a \"double trigger.\" That is, a trigger that has room for two fingers.)
