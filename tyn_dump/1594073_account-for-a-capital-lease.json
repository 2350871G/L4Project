An operating lease is a traditional lease whereby lessor (or owner of a property) transfers the right to use the property to a borrower (or lessee) for a particular period, after which it is returned. With an operating lease, the borrower assumes no risk of ownership. An operating lease involves no ownership of the asset, and therefore, the asset does not appear on the company's balance sheet in any way. The only important accounting for an operating lease is the rent, or lease payment, which appears on the income statement as an expense. Operating leases are typically short compared to the life of the asset. For example, if a piece of machinery is being leased, and the life of the machine is 25 years, an operating lease may be for five years."

A capital lease occurs when the lessee records the asset on the balance sheet as if it owns the asset. The lessee would then make lease payments to the lessor, and these payments consist of interest and principal repayments, just like a loan. There are several pro's to capital leases. Just like if the business actually owned the asset, they can choose to deduct the interest component of the lease payment each year for taxes, and can also claim depreciation each year on the asset. That is to say, as the asset decreases in value each year, the business can benefit from this, whereas this would not be possible with an operating lease. There are cons as well. For example, since the asset is listed on the balance sheet, this would make the company's return on assets lower. This is because since return on assets is income as a percentage of total assets, if assets increase, the return falls (assuming income stays the same)."

From an accounting perspective, when you enter into a capital lease, you are basically purchasing the asset, and then financing it using a loan. Therefore the accounting would be very similar to if you simply bought and financed an asset. This means you would first need to add the asset to the balance sheet as a fixed asset, and also add the value of the asset to the balance sheet as a capital lease liability (since you do not own the asset). Over the term of the lease, regular payments consisting of interest and principal would be made. The interest portion of the payment would be recorded as an interest expense on the income statement, and the principal would reduce the balance of the capital lease liability. For example, assume you were leasing an asset worth $10,000. This means $10,000 would be listed as an asset on the balance sheet, and $10,000 would be listed as a capital lease liability. If you had a $1,000 yearly payment, and $100 was interest, $900 would go towards reducing the capital lease liability account. Over time, this means the capital lease liability account would eventually reach zero.. Finally, you would need account for depreciation. Since assets depreciate over their useful life, you would need to account for the declining value of the asset each year."
