    "text": " Using a Jar Lid Find a small aluminum jar lid. The lid on a jar of baby food or the lid to a small mason jar will work. You want a lid that's around 2-3 inches (5-7.6 cm) in diameter. Place the jar lid face down on a flat surface. The underside of the jar lid should be facing up. Tap the center of the jar lid with a hammer several times. You want to create an indent in the jar lid that you can use to make the clicking sound. Don't hit the jar lid too hard with the hammer. Three or four firm taps should be enough. Pick up the jar lid and flip it over. The center of the jar lid should be sticking out. If it's not, set the jar lid back on the flat surface, face down, and tap it with the hammer a few more times. Press down the raised bump on the jar lid to make the clicking noise. The bump should pop back up into place after you release it. Using an Empty Flashlight Find a flashlight with a clickable \u201con\u201d button. Only a flashlight that has one of these buttons will work. The button is what makes the clicking sound. Usually these buttons are made out of rubber and found at the end of the flashlight. If you're not sure whether your flashlight will work, press the button to turn it on. If it doesn't make a loud clicking noise, it won't work. Unscrew the top of the flashlight to remove the batteries. Find the seam where the two halves of the flashlight connect. Twist the top half counterclockwise. Keep twisting until the two halves of the flashlight separate. Dump the batteries out of the flashlight. Put the flashlight back together. Screw the top half of the flashlight back onto the bottom half. Keep twisting until the two halves are securely connected. Press and release the \u201con\u201d button to make the clicking sound. Don't hold the button when you press it in. Just quickly press and release to make the loud clicking noise. Making an Aluminum Can Clicker Find an aluminum can. Any soda or beer can will work. Make sure the can is empty. Rinse the can out with water and let it dry. Use scissors to cut a square strip out of the side of the can. Make the strip 2 inches x 2 inches (5 cm x 5 cm). You want the strip to come from the curved side of the can, not from the top or bottom of the can. Wear gloves when you're cutting the can. Sharp edges on the can could cut you. Make a fold with each corner of the square. Fold each corner so the tip touches the center of the concave side of the strip. Unfold the corners. When you're done, there should be four creases on the strip. Tape two opposite sides of the square to a small plastic lid. Use a thin, flexible plastic lid, like the lid to a plastic container. Tape the square strip so that the curve is sticking up away from the lid. Be careful, the edges of the aluminum strip may be sharp. Press down on the curved aluminum strip to make the clicking sound. The center of the strip should pop down when you press it, making the noise. When you let go, the center of the strip should pop back up.",
