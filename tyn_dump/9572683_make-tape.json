        "If the duct tape you\u2019ll be using is wider or narrower than 2 in (5.1 cm), cut the card to that width instead.",
        "Most standard duct tape rolls sold in the U.S. are 2 in (5.1 cm) wide.",
        "You can make the card a bit longer or shorter than 4.5 in (11 cm) if desired, but this is a good pocket-size length.",
        "You can use an expired or used-up gift card as the base for your pocket-size duct tape roll, instead of a cut index card.",
        "Wrap a length of duct tape around the entire card.",
        "Cover the entire card (both sides) lengthwise in a single strip of duct tape, allowing the tape to overlap itself by about 1 in (2.5 cm).",
        "Press the tape firmly onto the card and itself at the overlap.",
        "This piece of tape is a permanent application, intended to make it easier to dispense the tape you\u2019ll add on top of it.",
        "Wrap a single strip of tape around the card several times.",
        "Work your way around the card lengthwise as many times as you prefer.",
        "Press the tape lightly to the layer beneath it as you work.",
        "You can probably fit around 15 ft (4.6 m) of tape on the card before it becomes too bulky for your convenience.",
        "Simply peel and tear the tape as needed to use it.",
        "You can refill the card with tape as often as you like."
