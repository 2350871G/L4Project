Use a fire-safe table or workbench to protect against burns from the metal solder and soldering iron. If you have a stainless steel or ceramic surface, you can use it. Another option is to spread a heat-resistant material, such as a glass soldering mat, where you plan on repairing the cord. Keep a cover and stand for the soldering iron nearby. That way, you don\u2019t have to worry about it touching and damaging your work surface. Tile, brick, and stone are a couple of types of scrap metal you can use to protect tables from dripping metal. Most materials are safe to use as long as you keep the soldering iron from them. Soldering is a great way to repair valuable cords when you don't want to buy a new plug or can't find a suitable one.

It\u2019s beginner-friendly and often used to repair electronics. Note that you may find solder with other percentages. They are all slightly different. Although they can be used, stick to a 63/37 lead solder wire for a straightforward repair. There are also lead-free solder wires.

Stay away from the repaired portion until you\u2019re sure the cord is working without issue. If you don\u2019t see anything unusual, then the repair was a success! If you notice a hissing sound, smoke, or other problems, shut off the power right away. For your own safety, do not touch the cord until you have deactivated the power. If the cord doesn\u2019t work and you\u2019re sure you repaired it correctly, the problem could be the outlet. Outlets wear out over time and need to be replaced so the metal contacts firmly connect to the plug. Splicing Wires by Soldering Set up a ventilated work space that is heat-resistant, if possible. Choose a spot with a ventilation fan or at least some windows you can open to let out any smoke from the soldering iron. Use a fire-safe table or workbench to protect against burns from the metal solder and soldering iron. If you have a stainless steel or ceramic surface, you can use it. Another option is to spread a heat-resistant material, such as a glass soldering mat, where you plan on repairing the cord. Keep a cover and stand for the soldering iron nearby. That way, you don\u2019t have to worry about it touching and damaging your work surface. Tile, brick, and stone are a couple of types of scrap metal you can use to protect tables from dripping metal. Most materials are safe to use as long as you keep the soldering iron from them. Soldering is a great way to repair valuable cords when you don't want to buy a new plug or can't find a suitable one. It works for all types of cords, but it's often best for single-wire cords with a permanently-attached plug. Slip a PVC shrink tube over the wire to use later. A PVC shrink tube is like a piece of plastic that protects and insulates exposed wires. They come in different sizes, so choose one that is at least as big as the area you wish to repair. A 1 in (2.5 cm) tube is enough for most repairs. After choosing a tube, slide it along one of the cords so it\u2019s out of the way, leaving the cut and stripped wires exposed. If you don\u2019t put the tube on the cord now, you won\u2019t be able to do it later. Make sure you get one that is the proper size for the repair! The tubes and other material needed for the repair are available online or at most hardware stores. Select 63/37 lead solder for an easy material to work with. Solder is a type of metal used to join wires together. A 63/37 solder wire is made of 63% tin and 37% lead, which both melt at a low temperature for a quick but strong fix. It melts at about 361 \u00b0F (183 \u00b0C). It\u2019s beginner-friendly and often used to repair electronics. Note that you may find solder with other percentages. They are all slightly different. Although they can be used, stick to a 63/37 lead solder wire for a straightforward repair. There are also lead-free solder wires. These wires are environmentally safe but melt at a higher temperature. If you decide to use one, note that it melts at a temperature about 50\u00b0F (30\u00b0C) higher than lead solder. Put on a pair of safety glasses before operating a soldering iron. Wear the glasses for protection in case the melted metal splashes on you. Also, consider wearing a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and closed-toe shoes for additional protection. Cover up as much as possible to avoid burns! Be aware of the smoke released during the soldering process, especially if you\u2019re working with lead. Work outdoors or in an otherwise ventilated area while wearing a dust mask. Keep other people and pets out of the area until you\u2019re finished and have given the soldering iron plenty of time to cool off. Twist the exposed ends of the cord\u2019s internal wires together. Cut out the damaged portion and strip the wires before doing this. Then, match the wires inside the severed cord according to the color of their insulation. Depending on the cord you\u2019re fixing, you might see more than 1 color, such as red and blue. Twist the red wires together, then twist the blue wires together, keeping the colors separate. Note that thicker cords, such as extension cords, have more than 1 internal wire. The wire colors have to match or else you could short-circuit the system. Smaller cords, such as your average lamp cord or phone charger, only have 1 wire. It is possible to solder wires by laying the exposed ends side by side. However, it\u2019s usually easier to twist them together and then coat them with solder. Melt solder over the top of the wires to coat them. Hold the tip of the solder wire at a 45-degree angle above the exposed wires. Then, raise the heated soldering iron up toward the wire, holding it at an opposite 45-degree angle. Gently melt the soldering material so it drips onto the exposed wires. Keep moving the solder wire and soldering iron back and forth until the exposed wires are coated in the solder. The goal is to melt the soldering material, not the repaired wires. To avoid melting them, don\u2019t let the soldering iron linger in one spot. Also, avoid touching it to the wires. You could get a soldering pencil instead of a regular soldering iron. It is smaller and easier to control, which can be important when working with small wires. Hold it like a pencil. Let the soldered wires cool for about 2 minutes. Leave them alone until they become cool to the touch. While the repair cools, turn off your soldering iron and set it aside in a safe spot, such as a holder. Keep the repaired cord undisturbed so the solder sets properly. If the solder doesn\u2019t have time to cool, it will be too brittle and the wires may come apart again. Heat the PVC tube gently after sliding it over the solder. Move the PVC tube down cord, positioning it so it completely covers the repaired area. To keep it from burning, get a hair dryer or another source of gentle but consistent warmth. Hold it about 5 in (13 cm) back from the cord. Move it back and forth to heat the tube until it shrinks and fits tightly over the soldered area. If you don\u2019t have a hair dryer or a heat gun, you could try using a lighter. Be very careful to avoid burning the tube. Test the cord by plugging it into an electrical outlet. Shut off the electricity to the outlet by flipping the corresponding switch in your home\u2019s fuse or circuit breaker box. Then, plug the wire in and reactivate the electricity. Watch the wire for smoke or other problems. If it seems to be working without a problem, then consider it repaired. Turn off the electricity right away if you notice hissing or other problems. Continuing to use the cord could lead to a fire or electrical shock. You most likely will need to replace it.",

        "Fixing a cord without soldering involves installing a new plug.",
        "The new plug has to match the old one, but there are various types of plugs.",
