                    "description": "Dig a small 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) hole in the soil with your finger or a spoon. Fill this hole with water. If it takes less than 10 minutes for the water to soak into the rest of the soil, your soil is well-drained. If it takes more than 10 minutes, replace the soil slowly over 1-2 weeks with an organic mix of peat moss, bark, and sandy soil.Tip: If you do need to replace the soil, do not change it out all at once. Use a trowel to scoop out 20-30% of the soil and replace it little by little over the course of several days. Continue doing this until the majority of your old soil is gone. Well-draining soil refers to soil compositions that won\u2019t cause water to pool up. Almost every potted palm tree you see at a nursery or store will already have well-draining soil, but it\u2019s important that you keep the soil well-draining over the palm\u2019s life. Palm trees are prone to root rot. If water pools up in the soil, it can increase the odds that the roots begin to rot. Well-draining soil ensures that the water doesn\u2019t stick around for too long in your pot."

Set your palm tree 0.5\u20132 feet (0.15\u20130.61 m) away from a large window in your home that gets a lot of sun.Tip: For most palm trees, a lack of light is the strongest contributing factor to a lack of growth. A healthy palm tree requires a lot of direct sunlight, so give them as much as you possibly can. If you don\u2019t have a well-lit room in your home that has large windows, it may be kind of tough to keep your palm healthy when it gets bigger. Parlor palms are the major exception when it comes to sunlight requirements. Parlor palms will do just fine in indirect light and can be kept 5\u201310 feet (1.5\u20133.0 m) away from sunny windows. Some species of palm tree, like the Kenita palm, sentry palm, and pygmy palm will do just fine with 2-4 hours of direct sunlight. Many people keep their potted palms outdoors during the summer months to ensure that it gets enough light and heat. You can keep a potted palm tree outside permanently if you live in a tropical area, but be sure to bring it inside during periods of excessive rain."

Adjust your thermometer before going to bed to ensure that your palm gets time to cool down at night.Since your palm tree needs to be near a window, it can get drafty if it gets cold out. During winter months, keep the window near your palm sealed with plastic wrap and tape to prevent freezing your palm tree. If your home regularly gets colder than 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C), the Kentia palms and European fan palms are great choices. They tend to be much more comfortable with lower temperatures than other palms. If the tree starts listing at an angle, it\u2019s likely due to a draft or uneven temperature. Continue adjusting the palm tree\u2019s location until you find a healthy location for your tree."

Keep your palm tree on a saucer with wheels to make it easier to roll outside when you need to water it. This is a major reason why people tend to keep palm trees on the main floor of their home! Some palm trees are sensitive to chlorine and other nutrients in tap water. If your palm hates tap water, leave a bucket of water out at least 24 hours before watering your palm to give the nutrients and chlorine time to evaporate."

To ensure that it doesn\u2019t grow too quickly, avoid using fertilizer. Most palm trees will do just fine without it, and fertilizer can trigger growth spurts and make your palm tree too tall for your home. Even if it is a shorter variety, rampant growth may block out your window or overrun the space in your home.Tip: You want your palm tree to grow, just not too quickly. The goal in avoiding fertilizer is not to stunt growth completely, simply to slow it down. When they\u2019re juveniles, it will typically take most palm trees 10-15 years to grow 10 feet (3.0 m) tall. Some species will never exceed 10 feet (3.0 m) in height. This is less of a concern for species that don\u2019t grow taller than 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8 m). The sago palm is an exception to this rule.

        "Continue adjusting the palm tree\u2019s location until you find a healthy location for your tree.",
        "Watering Your Tree Drench the palm's roots thoroughly with water every 2-3 weeks.",
        "The amount of water your palm tree needs depends on its species and size.",
        "Generally speaking, the larger the palm, the more water you need.",
        "Water your palm outdoors and pour 0.5\u20134 gallons (1.9\u201315.1 L) around the base of the plant until the soil is thoroughly soaked.",
        "Give the water 30-60 minutes to drain before taking the plant indoors.",
        "Most palm trees only require water every 2-3 weeks.Tip: Palm trees can be kind of heavy once they get big.",
        "Keep your palm tree on a saucer with wheels to make it easier to roll outside when you need to water it.",
        "This is a major reason why people tend to keep palm trees on the main floor of their home!",
        "Some palm trees are sensitive to chlorine and other nutrients in tap water.",
        "If your palm hates tap water, leave a bucket of water out at least 24 hours before watering your palm to give the nutrients and chlorine time to evaporate.",
        "Let the soil dry out completely before drenching the roots again.",
        "Palms do not typically require frequent watering.",
        "Wait for the soil to dry out completely before you take the palm back outside for another watering.",
        "To check the dryness, stick your finger 3\u20134 inches (7.6\u201310.2 cm) into the soil.",
        "If the soil feels moist, your tree doesn\u2019t need more water.",
        "If the soil is totally dry and brittle, it\u2019s time to water your palm again.Indoor palms require less water than palm trees that are grown outside.",
        "This is due to the fact that potted soil typically retains water for much longer than the soil outside.",
        "Some species of palm tree require more water than others.",
        "If your palm\u2019s soil dries out after 2-3 days, your specific tree may require several watering sessions a week.",
        "Mist your palm tree\u2019s leaves once a week to keep them humid.",
        "While the soil needs to dry out before you water your plant again, the leaves should basically always be moist.",
        "Fill a spray bottle up with distilled water and leave it near your plant.",
        "Once a week, mist the leaves of your palm tree to ensure they retain some moisture.If you prefer, you can set a humidifier up next to your palm tree and leave it on.",
        "A humidifier will typically provide enough moisture for the leaves and you can skip the spray bottle.",
        "Cut back on water and change the soil if the leaves begin turning brown.",
        "If your palm tree\u2019s leaves begin to turn brown at the tips, your plant is getting too much water and the soil is too humid.",
        "Use a trowel to remove most of the soil and discard it.",
        "Replace 50% of the container with a dry, well-drained soil.",
        "Then, wait 2-3 weeks to see if the leaves bounce back before watering your plant again.",
        "Managing Growth Avoid fertilizer to ensure that your palm grows slowly.",
        "You cannot trim a palm tree down vertically if it grows too tall for your home, and most palm trees will wither or die if you cut the trunk back.",
        "To ensure that it doesn\u2019t grow too quickly, avoid using fertilizer.",
        "Most palm trees will do just fine without it, and fertilizer can trigger growth spurts and make your palm tree too tall for your home.",
        "Even if it is a shorter variety, rampant growth may block out your window or overrun the space in your home.Tip: You want your palm tree to grow, just not too quickly.",
        "The goal in avoiding fertilizer is not to stunt growth completely, simply to slow it down.",
        "When they\u2019re juveniles, it will typically take most palm trees 10-15 years to grow 10 feet (3.0 m) tall.",
        "Some species will never exceed 10 feet (3.0 m) in height.",
        "This is less of a concern for species that don\u2019t grow taller than 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8 m).",
        "The sago palm is an exception to this rule.",
        "Sago palms, which aren\u2019t technically palm trees but look identical to many of them, tend to require fertilizer.",
        "Provide organic fertilizer 2-3 times a year if your palm isn\u2019t growing.",
        "If your palm tree is struggling to grow and doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s getting bigger, pour a handful of an organic fertilizer over the soil and work it in by hand.",
        "A 12-4-12 or 8-2-12 mix with iron, manganese, zinc, and copper will work well.",
        "Do this once every 3-4 months to ensure that your palm tree continues to develop.Avoid fertilizers that are high in nitrogen.",
        "These fertilizers can cause palm trees to grow too rapidly.",
        "Some palm trees will require 2-3 doses of fertilizer a year for their entire lifespan.",
        "This is typically necessary for palm trees that don\u2019t grow taller than 15 feet (4.6 m) when they\u2019re outside.",
        "Prune your palm tree by removing dead leaves as needed.",
        "As your palm tree grows over time, some of the leaves may struggle to get enough sun and water.",
        "Use shears to trim these leaves off to keep the rest of your plant happy and healthy.",
        "It may be 1-2 years before you need to do this.Some palms that develop a lot of leaves will require a lot of pruning.",
        "Other species will require almost no pruning at all.",
        "You cannot prune the trunk of the tree.",
        "Do not cut or trim this portion of the plant.",
        "Repot your tree if the roots grow too large for your container.",
        "If the roots grow too big for their pot, transfer the tree\u2019s contents in the spring or early summer.",
        "Dig out the soil and carefully pull the roots out of the pot without cutting or breaking them.",
        "Set them in a new pot that is at least 1 ft (0.30 m) deeper and wider than your previous pot before adding the soil.The roots will begin sticking out of the soil when they\u2019re growing too large.",
        "This typically won\u2019t happen until 2-3 years of continuous growth have occurred.",
        "Be extremely careful when doing this.",
        "If you break a lot of the roots, your palm tree may struggle to reestablish itself in its new pot.",
        "Palm trees tend to grow to fit the container they\u2019re in.",
        "If you use a massive pot for a small tree, it\u2019s more likely to grow taller quickly.",
        "Watch out for mites and mealybugs and treat your plant as needed.",
        "When it comes to palm trees, mites and mealybugs are the 2 most common pests.",
        "If your leaves begin to wilt, turn yellow, and you see web-like residue on your trunk, you may have mites.",
        "Mealybugs will leave a white moldy material behind on the trunk and bit the base of your tree\u2019s leaves.",
        "Quarantine affected plants in an isolated area outside and spray the tree with horticultural oil or neem oil every 7-14 days to kill the bugs.",
        "Palm trees are typically pretty safe inside.",
        "Mealybugs and mites are extremely unlikely to wander indoors, but they may attack your plant if you take it outdoors for the summer.",
        "Horticultural and neem oil are natural insecticides that won\u2019t harm your plant.",
        "They cover the surface of the plant and suffocate any pests."
