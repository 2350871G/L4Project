A full explanation of these functions is beyond the scope of this article, but some brief reminders can be given here:A larger aperture (smaller number) means less depth of field (i.e. less of your scene in focus), and more light being let onto the film. A smaller aperture will let less light onto the film, and give more depth of field. To demonstrate, turn the distance ring to 8 feet (2.4 m) and look at the red markers. At an aperture of f/5.6, the portion of your scene from about 6.5 to 11 feet (2.0 to 3.4 m) will be in focus. At an aperture of f/16, the portion from about 4.5 to 60 feet (1.4 to 18.3 m) will be in focus. A faster shutter speed (a larger number on the shutter speed ring; the \"100\", for example means 1/100th of a second) will let less light onto the film. A slower one will do the opposite. If you have a cable release and a tripod, you can use the \"B\" setting, which will hold the shutter open for as long as you need it to. Therefore, you can compensate for a smaller aperture by using a faster shutter speed, or a larger aperture by using a slower shutter speed. Compensating for lack of light with a slower shutter speed can result in motion blur (or blur from unsteady hands); compensating for it with the aperture will result in less depth of field. Which you will do, will depend from scene to scene."
