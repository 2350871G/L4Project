Anime hair is drawn using thick, distinct sections instead of individual strands, so draw a few thick sections coming down off of the hairline. They can be straight and angular for a spiky hair look, or you can curve them to one side so the hair looks flowy and natural. For example, you could draw several spiky sections of hair extending down across the length of the hairline. To draw sections of hair that frame the sides of the face, draw 2 outward-curving sections of hair, one on each side of the face, that start at the middle of the hairline and end about halfway down the head. If you don\u2019t want the hairstyle you\u2019re drawing to have bangs or loose sections of hair hanging down, you can skip this step."

For a spiky hairstyle, which is popular in anime, draw thick distinct spikes extending away from the head as you draw this line. For a flatter, sleeker hairstyle, just follow along with the curvature of the head. If you want the hair to cover the ears, start lower on the side of the face and draw up and around where the ears would go.
