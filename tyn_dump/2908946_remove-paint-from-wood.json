        "Switch to a fine grain sandpaper, if desired, once the majority of the paint has been sanded off and only a few small specks remain.",
        "Removing Paint with Chemical Paint Strippers Choose the right type of paint stripper.",
        "Look for a paint stripper labeled for use with the type of paint you want to remove.",
        "Also choose between a liquid or paste paint stripper.",
        "Liquid chemicals are often applied in spray form and are usually used to clean coatings or a couple of layers.",
        "Paste chemicals are brushed on and are used to strip many layers of paint.",
        "If you need to remove 10 layers or more, choose a paste.",
        "Read the instructions thoroughly before use.",
        "While the application procedure is the same for most chemical paint strippers, the exact details may vary.",
        "Always follow the instructions that come with the paint stripper.",
        "Pour a small amount of paint stripper in a wide-mouth metal can.",
        "Pouring a small amount in a small can makes it easier to use the paint remover.",
        "If possible, use a can with a plastic resealable lid.",
        "Brush the paint stripper on with a paint brush.",
        "Use a broad flat paintbrush to apply the chemical thickly and evenly over the surface of the painted wood.",
        "Brush the paint stripper on in one direction.",
        "Do not brush over areas that have already been covered by paint stripper.",
        "Alternatively, spray the paint stripper on.",
        "If using an aerosol paint stripper, point the nozzle of the bottle roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the surface of the painted wood and apply the chemical in an even, thick layer.",
        "The chemical will create a foaming, clinging layer.",
        "Let sit for as long as directed.",
        "Usually, the paint remover should be left on the surface for 20 to 30 minutes, but exact times may vary.",
        "Keep the windows and doors of the room open to prevent potentially harmful fumes from building up as the chemical sits.",
        "Test the paint.",
        "Rub the blade of a paint scraper over the surface in a circular motion.",
        "If the scraper cuts into the paint, the chemical has worked correctly.",
        "Make sure that the scraper you use is chemical-resistant.",
        "Scrape the paint off with a metal scraper.",
        "Glide the paint scraper beneath the softened paint to peel it away.",
        "Remove as much as possible with the first few passes.",
        "Work in one direction.",
        "Touch up the surface with soaked steel wool.",
        "If some paint still remains, soak medium-grade steel wool in a small amount of paint remover and scrub those spots until they lift up.",
        "Old rags or abrasive scouring pads will also work."
