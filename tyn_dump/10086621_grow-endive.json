Remove weeds by gently tugging them out of the ground when the soil is moist. For stubborn weeds, use a garden trowel to dig out the root systems. Wear gardening gloves to protect your hands while weeding. If the weeds in your garden are too out of control to get rid of by hand, use a herbicide as a last resort to kill their root systems. Use herbicide in moderation to prevent harm to your other plants. Use an herbicide meant for use on food gardens."
