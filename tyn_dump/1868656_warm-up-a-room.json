In general, you'll want to allow as much warm sunlight into your room as possible during the day and to prevent that warmth from leaving at night. For best results, you'll also need to know which windows in your room the sun shines through \u2014 generally, these are south-facing windows in the Northern Hemisphere and north-facing windows in the Southern Hemisphere. Here's simple sample schedule you may want to use:\n\nMorning: Before you leave for work or school, close all of your room's windows. Open the blinds all the way. Afternoon: Leave your blinds open until sun stops shining into your room. As soon as it starts to get dark and cold, close the blinds. Night: Keep the blinds and windows closed throughout the night to preserve heat."

        "Windows are one of the most frequent sources of heat loss for rooms.",
        "To counteract this, try hanging thick, heavy curtains around your window and closing them as soon as it starts to get cold in the evening.",
        "The heavy material of the curtains will help slow the heat loss through the glass, keeping the room warmer, longer.",
        "If curtains aren't in your budget, you can get a similar effect by hanging old blankets in front of windows.",
        "Cover bare floors (and walls.)",
        "Smooth, hard surfaces like wood, tile, and marble tend to retain much less heat than carpet.",
        "In fact, un-insulated floors can account for 10% of a room's total heat loss.",
        "If you're tired of freezing your toes off when you get up in the morning, consider laying down a rug or even having carpeting installed.",
        "This will also help keep your room warm once you've heated it \u2014 a carpeted room will stay warm longer after you turn off the heater than a room with a bare tile floor.",
        "You can even sometimes get away with covering some of your walls with carpet-like materials to increase this effect.",
        "Things like tapestries and decorative rugs can look great when they're hung from the wall and can keep your room slightly warmer at the same time.",
        "Invest in better insulation.",
        "Though it's a major investment, getting new insulation in your home can be a project that pays for itself in the long run, as this can dramatically reduce heating bills (especially for older, draftier houses).",
        "Another benefit, of course, is that you'll be warmer and more comfortable.",
        "Below are a just few types of insulation you may want to consider:\nWall insulation (fiberglass, etc.)",
        "Window insulation (double and triple-paned windows, protective films, etc.)",
        "Door insulation (draft guards, floor seals, etc.)",
        "Every house is different, so the amount of work required can vary wildly from house to house.",
        "Before you make any concrete decisions, talk to an experienced contractor (or several) and get an estimate for your project so you can determine what the best decision for you is"
