You may buy your duct tape at a hardware store or find a greater variety of colors and patterns at an arts and crafts store. You may also find unique designs online. Cut duct tape strips. Create fabric out of duct tape by cutting 16 strips of duct tape that measure 32 inches (81.3 cm) long and 2 inches wide. This will create 2 sheets of fabric, one for each panel of your tie as conventional ties are commonly constructed using two panels. Layer the strips. Place the strips on a flat surface with the sticky side up. Lay one horizontally and the next one beside it but overlap the edge slightly. Continue to do this until you have four strips wide. Top off the panel. Place strips of duct tape over the four adjoining strips so that the sticky portions face one another. Measure and lay down each strip with purpose as the tape will be difficult to adjust once two sticky faces are pushed together. Once you have 8 strips, 4 on each side, you finished a single panel of fabric. Repeat the layering process for the second panel of fabric. A traditional tie is composed of 2 panels that make up the top of the tie and the neck portion. Create a second panel of fabric for the second part of the tie by, again, overlapping 4 strips of duct tape and closing the panel with another 4 strips. Making a Pattern Lay down the top half of an old tie. Choose a tie that is a size you're looking for, don't choose a thick tie if you want a thin tie. Smooth the fabric so that it lays flat onto one of the panels. Trace the main portion of the tie. Use a pencil or sharpie to trace the tie but be careful not to stain your cloth tie. Make sure that you press hard enough to see the outline but not hard enough to puncture the duct tape. Felt works well but may easily be smudged if not careful. Lay down the skinny, neck portion on the second panel. Each panel should be use for a different part of you old tie. Use the second panel for the neck portion of your tie. Again, spread the fabric out flat onto the second duct tape panel. Trace out the skinny, neck portion. Using a pencil or marker, trace the skinny portion of your tie onto the second panel of duct tape fabric. If your tie is skinny the entire length, the neck portion is the part of your tie that will be closest to your chest and most likely covered by the other portion of fabric. Assembling the Tie Cut out both pieces. Use scissors to cut out both pieces of your tie from the duct tape fabric. Cut carefully as you do not want to damage the main pieces. If you used a marker, you can choose to include the outline to give a bold silhouette. Put the tie together. Tape the ends of the tie that will be closest to your face.

Creating a Bow Tie Cut a 9 inch piece of duct tape. Measure your duct tape and your neck before cutting. In case you're trying to make an comically large or small bow tie, adjust the measurements once you've perfected the technique. Fold both ends as if you were folding a paper into thirds. The ends should slightly overlap as they come together at the center and the duct tape should now measure about 4 inches (10 cm) in length.
