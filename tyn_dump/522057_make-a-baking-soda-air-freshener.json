Mix 5 to 6 drops of an essential oil into the baking soda with a spoon until they are well combined. You don't necessarily have to add an essential oil to the air freshener. The baking soda will absorb odors to help freshen the air on its own. However, adding the essential oil will allow the freshener to give off a pleasant scent too. Use your favorite essential oil to scent the air freshener. If you want to get creative, you can even mix two or more oils to create a custom scent. Lavender, chamomile, peppermint, lemon, eucalyptus, and rosemary essential oils are all good options."

You can use whatever herbs you like, but it helps to choose those that correspond with the essential oil.
