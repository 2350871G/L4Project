If necessary, add more water to the saucepan after placing the eggs inside. The eggs should be covered by about 2.5 cm (1 inch) of water. Attach an instant-read thermometer to the side of the pan. Make sure that the tip of the thermometer rests underneath the water so that it can read the temperature of the water throughout the process. You will need to monitor the temperature very closely.

Ideally, you should not allow the temperature of the water to rise above 61 degrees Celsius (142 degrees Fahrenheit) during any point of the process. At higher temperatures, the consistency and properties of the egg could be altered. You may end up cooking the eggs slightly without even realizing it. In a pinch, however, you might be able to allow the temperature to rise as high as 65 degrees Celsius (150 degrees Fahrenheit) without seeing significant changes in the quality of the raw egg. In particular, if you are not using a thermometer, you will need to watch the water and wait for bubbles to form on the bottom of the pan. When that happens, the temperature of the water will be about 65 degrees Celsius (150 degrees Fahrenheit). While this temperature is a little higher than the ideal, it can still work well enough."

Adjust the temperature settings on your stove as needed to accomplish this task. If you allowed the temperature of the water to rise to 65 degrees Celsius (150 degrees Fahrenheit) or if you are pasteurizing your eggs without the use of a thermometer, you should remove the pan from the heat source before allowing the eggs to sit in the hot water for three to five minutes."

Alternatively, you could place the eggs in a bowl of ice water instead of rinsing them under cool, running water. Running water is preferable since sitting water is more likely to develop bacteria, but either option will technically work.
