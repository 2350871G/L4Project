Pour your desired amount of milk into a microwave-safe glass or mug and heat in the microwave for 45 seconds. Pour heated milk into a coffee press. Use a coffee press, also called a French press, that has a glass container and a plunger. Pour the milk you heated into the glass container. Pump the milk in the press.
