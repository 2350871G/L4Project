Holding the handle of the fork in one hand, run the ginger root over the tines to shred it. Angle and turn your ginger root in different directions to get as much usable ginger as possible. Mince your ginger by cutting it into coins, then chopping finely. Use a chef\u2019s knife to cut your ginger into small, thin disks, then chop the disks lengthwise into matchsticks.
