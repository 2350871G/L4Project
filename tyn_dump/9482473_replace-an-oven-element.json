Head to your home's main circuit breaker and find the switch corresponding to the oven. Flip it to the \u201cOff\u201d position to disable the power. You may find 2 individual breakers, 1 for each of the 120-volt fuses that powers the oven. If this is the case, be sure to shut off both breakers. If there's not a separate breaker for the oven itself, you may have to flip the breaker for the whole kitchen. Unplug the oven from the wall as well, just to be on the safe side."

If the element in your oven is fastened with bolts instead of standard screws, you can strip them using a \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) nut driver tool.

Use a pair of needle-nosed pliers to gently pull the 2 colored wires away from the terminals on the backside of the element. Pay attention to how the wires are configured so you'll be able to easily reconnect them once you've installed the new element. Be careful not let the wires slip through the holes in the back of the oven, or you'll have no choice but to pull the entire unit out to thread them back through. It may help to tape them to the interior wall. Heating element wires are sometimes secured with small male-female spade connectors, or a thin, interlocking metal slot and insert. These can usually be separated with a quick pinch of your pliers."

You'll need to refer to this information when shopping for a new part to make sure you get 1 that's a match. Jot down any identifying info on the element before disposing of it.
