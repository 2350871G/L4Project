You can use a slightly smaller or larger baking dish if you prefer. This will determine how thick the rocky road fudge is going to be and how long it will take to set. Using a smaller dish will make thicker rocky road fudge. However, this will take longer to set. Similarly, a larger dish will make thinner fudge which sets faster. Avoid using a baking dish that is smaller than 7 in \u00d7 7 in (18 cm \u00d7 18 cm) or larger than 11 in \u00d7 11 in (28 cm \u00d7 28 cm), as this may significantly change the consistency of the fudge and how it sets."
