Take the cake and transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to gently rub and break the cake until it crumbles into smaller pieces. Rub each piece gently until it crumbles into small chunks that are smaller than 0.5 in (1.3 cm). This process will work with almost any kind of flour-based cake. Birthday cake, red velvet, angel food, and carrot cake will all work well. Do not squeeze the cake or compress it. The goal is to break it down without compressing it. If your cake has frosting, you can either scrape it off crumble it up along with your cake. Many people enjoy bits of frosting in their cake bites, but you can take it off if you\u2019d like. If you have any pieces larger than 1 in (2.5 cm), the cake bites won\u2019t cool properly and may fall apart when you bite into it."

Continue turning each handful around and squeezing it until you have a ball that is roughly 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. Repeat this process until you\u2019ve finished turning your cake crumbs into balls. You can use an ice cream scooper to make your balls uniform if you\u2019d like. These balls will be a little bigger, though. Don\u2019t worry if the balls aren\u2019t all equal in size. A little variation is totally fine."

Fill a bowl with liquid candy coating and stick a skewer into each ball before submerging them in the coating and putting them back on the baking sheet. If you want to make standard cake bites, place your balls on a spoon and dip them into the coating before putting them back on the baking sheet.Tip: If the coating pools up around the base of each ball when you put it back on the baking sheet, use a toothpick to draw a line around the base of each piece of cake. This way the coating won\u2019t harden the ball to the wax paper as it dries. You can also stick the skewers in a block of Styrofoam to avoid drips and make your pops look more appealing. Candy coating typically comes in a liquid form. The most popular flavors are chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. Make sure that you buy a coating that hardens. For a leftover cake that is roughly 9 by 13 in (23 by 33 cm), you\u2019ll probably need around 16\u201332 ounces (0.45\u20130.91 kg) of candy coating. Spoon extra coating on top of each ball after you put them on the baking sheet if you really want to sweeten them up. For a less sweet version, skip this step entirely.

For muffin recipes, don\u2019t replace more than 25% of the flour with cake crumbs to avoid overpowering the flavor. This will work with plain cakes the best, but you can certainly change the overall flavor of your cookies or muffins by using a fruit-flavored or vanilla cake as well. Chocolate cake will work nicely with chocolate chip muffins or cookies. You cannot do this with flourless cake.

Use a spoon to scoop it up and let it settle on top of the apple and cake.Variation: You can substitute the custard with yogurt if you want a healthier option that won\u2019t be as sweet. The yogurt version makes a great breakfast treat. Vanilla or plain custard is the most common choice for trifle, but you can use another fruit flavor if you\u2019d like. If you\u2019re using multiple layers, add a layer of custard before adding another layer of cake. Add the rest of your apples and berries. Top your final layer with more custard. Fill the remainder of each glass with whipped cream if you\u2019d like. Fill the remainder of each glass with whipped cream if you want to sweeten the dish further. Alternatively, you can add a small squirt of whipped cream to sweeten it a little bit. It\u2019s entirely up to you how much whipped cream you add. This step is completely optional. If you don\u2019t want to sweeten the already-flavorful dish, feel free to skip the whipped cream. You can use any type of whipped cream for this. Garnish each glass with chopped walnuts. To add a little crunch to the dish, sprinkle chopped walnuts on top of each glass to taste. If you really enjoy nuts, cover the top of each glass entirely. Otherwise, sprinkle a small amount on top. It\u2019s completely up to you. You can use chopped almonds or some other variety of nut if you prefer. You can also skip the nuts entirely if you aren\u2019t into them. A dash of cinnamon or nutmeg can make a great addition as well if you enjoy these flavors. Refrigerate for 1-2 hours and enjoy your treat. Put your glasses in the refrigerator to let the ingredients cool and stiffen a little. Leave the glasses in the fridge for 1-2 hours before taking them out to eat. Cover any glasses you aren\u2019t going to eat immediately with plastic wrap and store them for up to 36 hours. Add a maraschino cherry or slice of strawberry to the top of the whipped cream if you want a little extra fruit. Using Cake for Other Treats Use the cake crumbs as a topping for ice cream. Turning your leftover cake into a topping for ice cream is the easiest way to get rid of your leftovers. Simply crumble the cake in a mixing bowl until you reach a texture that seems appealing to you. You can make the chunks as big or small as you\u2019d like. Sprinkle the cake crumbs over a few scoops of ice cream to give it a unique flavor and texture. For a crunchier version, crumble the cake on a baking sheet and bake it for 20 minutes at 250 \u00b0F (121 \u00b0C). Replace some of the flour in your muffins or cookies with cake. This is a particularly good option if you have a lot of crumbs leftover but don\u2019t want to make a specific recipe. Crumble the leftover cake into a fine powder and mix it in with your flour. Replace up to 50% of the flour in your cookie recipe with cake. For muffin recipes, don\u2019t replace more than 25% of the flour with cake crumbs to avoid overpowering the flavor. This will work with plain cakes the best, but you can certainly change the overall flavor of your cookies or muffins by using a fruit-flavored or vanilla cake as well. Chocolate cake will work nicely with chocolate chip muffins or cookies. You cannot do this with flourless cake. So long as the cake recipe used flour though, this is a great way to use excess leftover cake. You can also use this process to replace 50% of the flour in a pie crust recipe. Make some French toast using your leftover cake slices. Freeze your cake for 20-60 minutes. Then, whisk 1 egg in a bowl with 1  fl oz (30 mL) of milk and 2  fl oz (59 mL) of Baileys, Rumchata, or cream. Dredge your frozen cake in the mixture and heat the slices in a buttered frying pan over medium heat for 2-3 minutes on each side. Top with syrup or sugar to enjoy your slices of cake as French toast! Ideally, your cake should be in rectangular slices that are 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) thick. Cut your cake as needed to turn preexisting slices into rectangles. This will only really work with standard birthday cake.",
