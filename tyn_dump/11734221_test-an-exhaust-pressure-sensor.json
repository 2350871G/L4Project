Look around for a small, black rectangular box that has 2 rubber hoses coming out from the bottom and an electrical connector plugged into one side.

        "Typically, the ground port is the leftmost or rightmost prong but it may vary depending on the sensor you have.",
        "Press the positive lead from the meter on the sensor\u2019s signal post.",
        "Locate the signal prong post in the port next to the other prongs.",
        "Check the prong labels to find the one labeled \u201cSignal\u201d or using a positive sign (+).",
        "Keep the red probe against the prong in order to take a resistance reading.",
        "Get a new pressure sensor if you get an open line reading on the meter.",
        "Look at the display on the multimeter to see if it says \u201cOL,\u201d which means open line.",
        "If it does, that means the sensor doesn\u2019t have any electrical resistance and won\u2019t work properly.",
        "Buy a new sensor that\u2019s the same shape and design as the one you have so it fits in your vehicle properly.",
        "If you notice the numbers changing on the multimeter display, then the sensor has electrical resistance, meaning a current can pass through it and it will still work in your vehicle."
