This will prevent primer, wood dust, or paint from getting on your counters or kitchen floor. A toe kick refers to the wood or plastic barrier at the bottom of your cabinets. It is designed to prevent structural damage to the wood from accidental kicks or spills. Stripping and Sanding the Cabinets Put on a dust mask or respirator and a thick pair of gloves. The fumes in most stripping agents, lacquer thinners, and primers are lung irritants. Prevent damage to your lungs by wearing a thick dust mask or respirator. Wear a pair of thick gloves to avoid getting stripping agent on your skin. Open a window if you haven\u2019t already. The ventilation will prevent fumes from building up in your kitchen.

Select a stripper that is designed for cabinets or wood furniture. For each cabinet door or drawer, do each step with your removable pieces set on top of a set of sawhorses or a stable work surface. Set a bucket or pan underneath the area that you\u2019re going to scrape. When you scrape the stripper away, the agent that you applied will pool up in the direction that you scrape. To catch it as it drips off, keep a bucket or pan underneath each section that you\u2019re scraping. Move the bucket or pan with you as you work from area to area.

After you\u2019ve removed the majority of the lacquer, let your cabinets air dry for 6-12 hours. Sand your cabinets using a 220-grit sandpaper or extra-fine sponge. Use 220-grit sandpaper sheets or an extra-fine sanding sponge to remove the top layer of wood. This will allow the primer to soak into the grain of your wood. Sand each section of your cabinets lightly by using back-and-forth strokes in the direction of the grain. You can sand with a coarser sandpaper if you don\u2019t see any wood dust coming off of your sanding sponge or sheet. Vacuum the debris and wipe your cabinets with a dry cloth. Use a vacuum with a hose attachment to remove wood dust from each section of your cabinets by running the hose 0.5\u20132 inches (1.3\u20135.1 cm) away from the wood. After vacuuming, wipe your cabinets down with a dry cloth to remove any remaining splinters, dust, or debris. Priming Your Cabinets Tape any edges that you want to keep dry using painter\u2019s tape. Use painter\u2019s tape to cover any areas that you want to keep dry, such as the walls next to your cabinet or the backsplash above your counters.

The fumes can be a lung irritant. Apply your primer to each cabinet and door with a roller and brush. Use a nylon-polyester brush to paint edges and trim around each door. Work in the direction of the wood grain, and use back-and-forth strokes to cover each section. For flatter panels or surfaces, use a 6 in (15 cm) foam roller to apply your primer. You can choose whether or not you\u2019re going to paint the inside of your cabinet doors. If you do, wait for each side to dry before flipping them over to paint the other side. Prime your cabinet frames and wait for them to dry. Use the same roller and brush to cover your cabinet frames. Start with the trim and paint around the top and bottom of your cabinets. Use a foam roller to cover the flat sections of your cabinets. Wait 12-24 hours after applying your primer to ensure that it dries properly. You don\u2019t need to use the brush to paint the thin panels in between doors. You can roll the face of each panel to make things easy. Painting the Cabinets Sand your cabinets again with 220 grit sandpaper. Use a fine-grain sponge or sandpaper to sand your primed surfaces. This will ensure that any thick layers of primer will be removed while making it easier for the paint to soak into your wood grain. Wipe your cabinets clean and vacuum them again to prepare your cabinets for painting. If you used a putty to prime your cabinets, you may need to use a sandpaper with a grit between 100-150. Choose a latex or oil-based gloss paint for your topcoat. Select a color that you want and choose a latex paint if you want a uniform finish. If you like the look of brushstrokes and want some texture, use an oil-based paint. Opt for a gloss or semi-gloss paint to prevent oil or grease from sticking to your cabinets.Warning: If you\u2019re painting the insides of your cabinets, choose an eggshell finish in the same color as your exterior paint. Gloss and semi-gloss paint will stick to your dishware. If you don\u2019t paint the insides, line them with drawer liners to keep the wood safe. Pour \u20444 gallon (2.8 L) of your paint into a clean paint tray. Use a flathead screwdriver to pry the top off of your can of paint. Mix the paint with a mixing stick until the color is even and uniform. Slowly pour it into a fresh paint tray by holding the handle and tilting the can. Use your brush or a clean rag to wipe any drips off of your paint can. If you\u2019re using a latex paint, you don\u2019t have to wear a dust mask. The fumes can be kind of strong if you\u2019re working in a poorly-ventilated area though. Apply paint to the drawers and doors using a brush and roller. Use an angled sash brush to paint the edges and trim of each drawer and door. Use a clean, 6 in (15 cm) foam roller to cover larger, flatter surfaces. Paint in the direction of the wood grain. Wait 6-12 hours before painting the other side of each piece if you want to paint both sides. Get a high-quality brush and roller. You don\u2019t want to leave streaks or gaps in the grain because you opted for a cheaper brush. Paint the cabinet frames with the same brush and roller. Use the same brush and roller to ensure that your paint\u2019s texture is the same on your drawers, doors, and frame. Apply paint to the trim around the walls and edges first, and use your foam roller to apply paint to the flat panels in your cabinet frame. Keep your brush strokes consistent and work in the direction of the grain to keep your topcoat uniform. Wait 24-36 hours to let the paint dry and remove your tape. Let your paint air dry for at least 24 hours before handling anything. If your paint isn\u2019t consistent or you want a deeper color, apply a second layer of paint and wait an additional 24 hours. After your paint has dried, remove your painter\u2019s tape by carefully and slowly peeling it off. You\u2019re going to be handling your cabinets pretty heavily when you install your doors and drawers. It is best if you can manage to wait longer before reinstalling the doors and drawers. Reinstall your doors and drawers and clean up. Use a flathead or Phillips-head screwdriver to reinstall each cabinet with the proper bracket. Use your labels or corresponding diagrams to match each drawer and door in the proper location. Once everything is back where it belongs, lift up your drop cloths and shake them outside or over a trash bin to remove the debris. Sweep your floors with a broom and put everything back to enjoy your new cabinets!",
