        "Keep the burner on medium and stir the mixture in the saucepan.",
        "Keep stirring until the liquids thicken and form a smooth pudding.",
        "It's important to stir so the pudding doesn't stick to the bottom of the saucepan and burn.",
        "Stir in the butter and vanilla.",
        "Turn off the burner and stir in 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter along with 1 \u20442 teaspoons (7.4 ml) of vanilla extract.",
        "Keep stirring until the butter melts.",
        "Then set the pudding aside to cool a little while you prepare the pan and meringue.",
        "Spread the vanilla wafers and banana slices in the bottom of the dish.",
        "Open an 11-ounce (311 g) box of vanilla wafers and place them in the bottom of the 9 in \u00d7 13 in (23 cm \u00d7 33 cm) baking dish.",
        "Then arrange the banana slices evenly over the wafers.",
        "Substitute your favorite cookies for the vanilla wafers.",
        "For example, line the bottom of the dish with graham crackers or shortbread.",
        "Pour the pudding over the wafers and banana slices.",
        "Then use the back of a spoon to spread the pudding evenly across so it's level in the pan.",
        "Some of the pudding should fall down between the wafers and bananas.",
        "Whip the egg whites with tartar and sugar until stiff peaks form.",
        "Add 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cream of tartar to the mixing bowl with the egg whites.",
        "Turn the mixer on to high speed and beat the whites until they're softly whipped.",
        "Keep the mixer running and slowly pour in 1 1/3 cup (263 g) of granulated sugar.",
        "Beat until the egg whites form stiff peaks.",
        "It should take 2 to 3 minutes for the egg whites to form stiff peaks.",
        "To test the whites, turn off the mixer and lift a beater out of the bowl.",
        "This should leave an egg white peak that holds its shape.",
        "Spoon the meringue over the pudding.",
        "Use a large spoon to push the meringue all the way to the edges of the baking dish so all of the pudding is completely covered.",
        "The meringue will seal the pudding in so it doesn't bubble out as the meringue bakes.",
        "Bake the banana pudding for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Put the baking dish in the preheated oven and cook it until the meringue is lightly brown on top.",
        "Then remove the banana pudding and let it cool for 10 minutes before you serve it.",
        "Cool the leftover banana pudding and cover it with plastic wrap.",
        "Store the leftover banana pudding in the refrigerator for up to 1 day.",
        "The meringue will weep and the bananas may darken the longer the pudding is stored."
