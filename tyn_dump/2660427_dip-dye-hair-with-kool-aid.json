Red, blue, and purple are popular options that show up nicely on all hair colors. You can also mix your own custom colors! For example, try mixing together 2 packages of grape Kool-Aid and 1 package of cherry to get a high-intensity burgundy color. If you have dark hair, avoid using yellow or orange. You can try green, but you\u2019ll probably get better results with a more saturated hue, like purple or blue."
