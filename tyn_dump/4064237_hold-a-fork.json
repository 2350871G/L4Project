In the American style, eaters switch the fork over to their right hand to eat the pieces that they have cut. Traditionally, this is the main difference between the European and American forking styles. The European style is often considered more efficient because you don't have to remove the fork from you hand until you are done eating. If you're setting the table for \"European-style\" eating: make sure to arrange the fork on the left-hand side of the plate, and the knife on the right-hand side."
