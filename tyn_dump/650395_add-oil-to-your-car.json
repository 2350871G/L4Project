Most auto manufacturers require you check the oil after the car has been warmed by starting it in place for 3-5 minutes. Check your owner's manual if there is any doubt.

The dipstick is a long piece of metal that extends down a tube to the oil pan, telling you, based on how high the oil line is, how much oil is in the engine.

For example, if you are driving an older car 5000 miles a month, your car might burn a quart of oil a month. If the oil looks milky or white you could have a coolant leak and must get the car towed to a mechanic immediately. If the oil has metallic particles or bits in it, get it to a mechanic immediately. If the oil seems dirty or sludge-like, it's time to change your oil. You should not be filling up the oil every few weeks or month -- this could be the sign of a leak."

This tells you how well it flows in cold weather when it the oil is thicker. The second number is how well the oil maintains its thickness in heat. The first number should be at least 5W or lower if you live in very cold areas (see your owner's manual), as oil can get too thick for the car to start if the winter viscosity is too high. Your owner's manual will have a recommended viscosity rating for your car. If there is only one number, as found in some older cars, your car uses a \"single-weight\" oil."
