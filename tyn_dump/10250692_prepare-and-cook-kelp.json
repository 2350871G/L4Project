Leave the kelp to soak for at least 5 minutes to get crunchy kelp or 10 minutes to get soft kelp. Whisk the vinegar, oil, soy sauce, sugar, salt, and ginger juice together.

You can find ginger juice in the juice aisle at most grocery stores. If you're having trouble finding it, check Asian markets or substitute freshly grated ginger. Drain the seaweed and squeeze out the extra water. Set a fine mesh strainer over the sink and pour the rehydrated kelp into it. Then gather the kelp between your hands and squeeze it firmly so the excess water drains into the sink. Toss the kelp into a bowl along with the dressing. Put the kelp into a serving bowl and pour the dressing over it. Mix the kelp with the dressing until the kelp is completely coated. Avoid mixing the kelp with the dressing ahead of time or the salad may become too soggy. Garnish the kelp salad with sesame seeds and scallions. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon (8 g) of toasted sesame seeds and 1 finely chopped scallion over the kelp salad. Serve the salad immediately. Avoid storing the kelp salad because it will become soggy the longer it's stored. Cooking Korean Kelp Soup Rehydrate the dried kelp in 5 cups (1.2 l) of water for 30 to 40 minutes. Put 1 ounce (28 g) of dried kelp into a large bowl and pour in 5 cups (1.2 l) of cold water. Set the kelp aside to soak for 30 to 40 minutes.

Pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of sesame oil into a large pot and turn the burner to medium-high. Once the oil shimmers, stir in the drained kelp and stir it frequently as it cooks. The kelp will absorb the flavor of the sesame oil as it cooks. Add the remaining 7 cups (1.7 l) of water, salt, and Korean soy sauce. Pour the water and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of Korean soy sauce into the pot. Stir in 1 teaspoon (5.5 g) of salt and combine the ingredients. If you can't find Korean soy sauce, you can substitute readily available soy sauce. Bring the soup to a boil and simmer the soup for 20 to 30 minutes. Once the soup begins to bubble vigorously, turn the burner down to medium heat. Let the uncovered soup bubble gently for 20 to 30 minutes. The kelp will soften as it simmers. Taste and serve the Korean kelp soup. The soup will become saltier the longer it simmers. Turn off the burner and taste the soup. Stir in more salt if you prefer it to be saltier. Serve the soup while it's hot. Store the leftover kelp soup in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Keep in mind that the kelp will continue to soften as it's stored. Making Stir-Fried Kelp Noodles Rinse and drain a 12-ounce (340 g) package of kelp noodles. Open the package and put the kelp noodles into a fine mesh strainer.
