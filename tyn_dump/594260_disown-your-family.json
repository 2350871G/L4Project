The most important first step is to get to a place of safety. Once you're removed from your family's household, CPS will help you determine how to proceed in order to make sure your family won't be able to harm you. If you're unsure about calling CPS, talk to a trusted adult like a teacher, school counselor or your friends' parents about your options. Understand that when you turn 18, your parents will no longer have the legal right to make decisions for you. Maybe you don't get along with your parents, but are they putting you in actual danger? If not, your best bet might be to wait it out. When you turn 18, you'll be able to live your life the way you want."
