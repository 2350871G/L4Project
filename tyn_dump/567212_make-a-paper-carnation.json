    "text": " Accordion-Fold Method Layer several sheets of tissue paper. Use at least 5 sheets, but more can be used to create fuller flowers. Sheets can be all the same color or a variety of colors depending on how you want your flowers to look. Align the edges of the tissue paper. You will be working with a square or rectangular shape. Fold the tissue paper like an accordion or a fan. Each fold should be about an inch to an inch and a half wide (2.5 to 3.8 cm). Crease paper firmly by pushing down on the top of the folded paper. If needed, place a thin towel over the folded tissue paper and firmly press with a hot iron to help set the folds. Fold the creased paper in half around a pipe cleaner. Twist the pipe cleaner underneath the crease to connect the layers. It can also serve as the stem of the flower. Trim the edge of the paper accordion to shape the petals. Use scissors to cut a point or rounded edge onto the folded paper. Spread out each side of the folded paper. Separate sheets by gently pulling each individual sheet of paper toward the center of the flower. Repeat until all sheets are pulled to the center. Finished. Gently pull individual sheets of paper upwards and towards the center of the flower. This will make it 3-dimensional. Circular-Cut Method Layer up to 12 sheets of tissue paper. Sheets can be folded until layers are 48 pieces thick to save time. Draw 3-inch (7.5 cm) circles onto the paper. For smaller flowers, you can make smaller circles, and likewise larger circles for larger circles. Cut out the circles through all the sheets. You will be left with stacks of 48 paper circles. (Note: Less paper can be used to make fewer flowers). Stack 12 paper circles. Secure the pieces with a paper clip and puncture two holes in the center with a sharp point, such as a large sewing needle. Thread a pipe cleaner through the holes. After pushing it through one hole, curve it and push it back out the other hole to form a loop that secures the paper. The pipe cleaner will also serve as the stem. Separate the sheets of tissue paper. Gently pull each sheet toward the center of the flower and firmly crinkle the base of each piece to hold the flower shape. Toilet Paper Method Pull a length of toilet paper 15 to 25 pieces long. Detach from the roll but do not detach the individual squares. Fold the toilet paper like an accordion or a fan. Make each fold about an inch wide (2.5 cm). Secure the middle of the folded toilet paper with a string or thread.  Fan the folded edges. Holding the center, gently twist each side toward the center of the flower to fluff the edges. Fold a piece on green crepe paper into a bow tie shape. Glue it to the back of the flower to make leaves. Finished. ",
