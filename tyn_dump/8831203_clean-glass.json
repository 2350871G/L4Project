    "text": " Cleaning Glass Windows Lay towels on the windowsills. You don\u2019t want the windowsills to get wet with the cleaning solution, especially if they are made of wood. Protect the windowsills by laying towels down over them. Make sure none of the windowsill is left exposed. Mix vinegar and water to make a cleaning solution. Use four parts water and one-part white vinegar. Pour the water and vinegar in a bowl. You can pour the solution in a spray bottle if you wish to spray it onto the glass surface. Dip the cloth into the cleaning solution. You can use a cotton cloth, microfiber towel, or even a newspaper to wipe down the glass. Dip the cloth into the mixture. Or, you can spray the cleaning solution onto the cloth. Wring out the excess fluid. Spray the cleaning solution directly onto the glass if you are cleaning a large area. Wipe off the glass. Begin by wiping the glass in circular motions. Then, wipe the glass with vertical strokes. After that, use horizontal strokes to clean the glass. Clean the corners with a cotton swab. You can use a cotton swab, or an old, soft toothbrush to clean the corners of the glass window. Dip the cotton swab or toothbrush into the cleaning solution. Scrub the corners of the glass where dirt or dust may have gathered. Buff the glass. You can use an old T-shirt, newspaper, or even cloth diapers to buff the glass.
