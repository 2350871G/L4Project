For example, Windows uses a Live File System and a Mastered format (better for compatibility in other devices) for copying files to CDs or DVDs. Insert a writable CD or DVD into your computer's CD or DVD recorder for the Live File System. When the dialog box appears, click \"Burn files to data disc.\" Name the disk, then click \"Next.\" Wait for an empty folder for the disc to appear. This means the disc is formatted and ready to copy files. Open the folder with the documents you want to archive and drag the files into the empty disc folder. For the Mastered format, insert a writable CD or DVD into a computer's CD or DVD recorder. When the dialog box appears, click \"Burn files to data disc.\" Name the disc and click \"Show formatting options.\" Choose \"Mastered\" and click \"Next.\" Wait for an empty folder for the disc to appear.
