To cut, use the end of the scissors to stab into the side of the jug before cutting. Once the scissors have a hold, cut around the jug. Cut to remove the top completely. Although you could cut straight around you could also create a wave pattern or even an up and down pattern around the top of the jug. Make sure you are closer to the top of the jug opening so you leave enough room to hold the soil. It might help to mark the are you wish to cut around the jug, to have an easy-to-follow line."
