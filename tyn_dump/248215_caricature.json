For example, a person's eyes might droop down noticeably or their lips might be incredibly plump. Once you know the features to exaggerate, make them a little more extreme so they really stand out.

For example, for your Barack Obama sketch, start by drawing a large forehead. Then, instead of making the eyes higher and larger near the forehead, keep them small and lower on the face. This will make the forehead stand out even more. Go back and sketch glasses or accessories after you've finished drawing the features."

Try exaggerating different features on the other sketches or draw your subject from different angles or sizes. This can help you see what really works for your specific subject. Sketch your subject showing different moods to see which captures the likeness you're going for. For example, you might sketch comedian Jim Carrey looking serious or thoughtful, but a sketch of Carrey with a wacky expression will be more recognizable."
