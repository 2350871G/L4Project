Make sure it's okay with the head teacher, or whoever it is in charge of that kind of thing. Putting the notices on a music department notice board is good, since people interested in music are going to be looking at it. Consider putting \"band practice\" or \"band auditions\" in large, bold font to attract the reader's attention. It's all advertising, right?

It's better to start writing straight away, because then you can only get better and better. It's good to cover some songs too though, especially if you've got writers block. It happens to all of us, even huge songwriters can get stuck. To write a song, think of a \"story line\". Maybe something that's happened to you that made you angry, upset, or happy. It's a good idea to not make the song scream this out, but making the song based around the event makes the listener intrigued (that's why they go on the Internet and find out what the meanings are of their favorite songs). It's also a lot easier if you and the band sit together and brainstorm ideas, then you can all share experiences and therefore making songwriting a little easier because you might have a great experience but it could be painfully difficult to write about."

The basic \"two lines rhyme, then the next two rhyme with a different ending\" is good.

Or guitar riff? Is the lead guitarist going to do a solo? Should there be a part where there is no background music and then there is a line sung A Capella? How is the drum beat going to go? More importantly- how is the bassline going to go? What guitar tune should we put in the back? All huge questions, all difficult to answer, but it only comes with time. Sit down with the band and discuss the songs on by one. Ask your fellow bandmates to write down anything that they come up with, whether it be in Chemistry class, while practicing completed songs, or while playing a video game. Never leave it- always write down your ideas, because there's nothing worse than having an amazing idea, only to lose it in your mind. Meanwhile, focus on writing more songs and get some venues."

You have fans! When you get pretty good, see if you can get a gig locally. Don't expect to be performing at the Warped Tour! Hire a venue if you can. Maybe a city hall or anything available of a similar description. This might be a little costly, but make sure the people who come and watch you leave with some awesome music ringing in their ears. You want them to like you as soon as they look at you. So smile, have a stage presence and a sense of humor. Poke fun at yourself, saying things like you've never performed properly before and so excuse you if you're pretty bad. Put on a good show, and it will be worth the money you paid for the venue, because the people coming to watch you will have fun, but more importantly you'll have an insanely awesome time that you'll want to relive over and over again. If you're enjoying yourself, let the audience know it! Smile, dance crazily and look like you're having so much fun it's almost criminal."

Being in a band makes you develop a superglue bond with your bandmates. You'll go through hell and high water with them. Remember when Bob Bryar left My Chemical Romance? Everyone was very sad, but look how far My Chemical Romance has come since then. Remember when Brownsound left Sum 41? It was awful! But Sum 41 carried on and made great music. What I'm saying is that even if one of the band leaves, it's not the end of the world (however it is a very good idea to have two guitarists so if one leaves, you have a backup), just struggle through it until you can find a replacement. The best bands have had some sort of struggle. My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way's drug problem- he got over it and he now feels squeaky clean. Josh and Zac Farro leaving Paramore - they got over it. Just remember to love your music and have a good time."
