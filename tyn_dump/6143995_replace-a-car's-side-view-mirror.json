        "You don\u2019t want to damage any of the electrical components.",
        "Use pliers to remove any electrical connectors.",
        "Attach your pliers to the edge of the mirror component, focusing on the areas where the electrical connectors are hooked into the mirror.",

        "Squeeze your pliers and grip the electrical connectors again, placing them in the same place on the new mirror.",

        "Press the mirror into place until you hear a click.",
        "Use both hands to apply pressure along the sides of your new glass.",

        "Push in 4 clips along the edges of the casing.",
