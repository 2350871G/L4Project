In some cases, a social media policy is just a list of best practices, and does not block employees from using it. In the company's social media policy, look at how they define social media and any occasions that it can be used. Also, find out if you are allowed to identify yourself as an employee of your company on your personal Twitter account, and what disciplinary actions are given if you use Twitter in a way that is deemed inappropriate. Do not ask about a specific social media site and try not to go directly to your manager. These could be red flags to your boss that you are not getting your work done. In some cases, you may already have access to the employee rule book that states the social media policy, in which case, you should use it before speaking to HR. Some companies have a policy of allowing unrestricted use of the Internet as long as you complete your work. If this is the policy, and especially if you work in a small, close knit office, then you should feel free to use Twitter during work, as long as it does not affect your work performance."
