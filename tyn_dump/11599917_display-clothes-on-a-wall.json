        "Find a stud with a stud finder and mark its location with a pencil.",
        "Then, locate the adjacent stud and mark it with a pencil as well.",
        "You can also locate studs by knocking lightly on the wall and listening for a higher, more solid sound that would indicate that a stud is behind the wall.",
        "If you have a plaster wall, use a stud finder to locate studs behind the thick surface.",
        "Hold a mounting bracket against the wall and mark the location.",
        "Mounting brackets are L-shaped metal pieces used to support shelves.",

        "If your wall is made of plaster or drywall, choose a location above a wall stud.Tip: If you plan to mount multiple levels of shelves, place the bracket against the wall at each of the levels you want to place them.",
        "Then, measure the space between each of the brackets so you can install them evenly.",
        "Draw a straight line to the second stud and mark the location.",
        "Use a ruler, level, or straight edge to draw a straight line from the mark you made for the first bracket to the location you plan to install the second mounting bracket.",
        "The line must be even in order for the shelves to be installed evenly.",
        "If you\u2019re mounting the shelves to wall studs, make sure the second location is over a stud.",

        "Drive the screws all the way into the wall.",
        "If your mounting brackets came with screws, use them to install the brackets.",
        "If you\u2019re drilling into tile or concrete, drill pilot holes into the wall, then drive the screws into place.",
        "Place the shelf on the mounting brackets and screw it into place.",
        "Rest the shelf on the mounting brackets and make sure it sits evenly.",
        "Use a drill to drive screws into the shelf so it\u2019s anchored to the brackets.",
