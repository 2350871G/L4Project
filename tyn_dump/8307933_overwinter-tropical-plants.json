                    "description": "The weather can sometimes change quickly and unpredictably. Because a sudden drop in temperature or unexpected frost can kill your tropical plants, you should keep a careful eye on the weather during the transition from summer to winter. A good rule of thumb is to begin preparing to bring plants indoors when the temperature reaches around 50 to 60\u00b0F (10 to 15.6\u00b0C). To prevent unexpected plant death, you may want to research the tropical plants you wish to save. This way you'll be certain of the lower range of their temperature resistance."

A bright, sunny, well heated room or a garden window can be an ideal place for this purpose. Putting your plant in this kind of location will trick it into thinking it's still in its growing season. This will keep the plant alive and active during the winter months. The ideal light and humidity for many tropical plants may be more than your home can provide. In many cases, decreased growth indoors is common. Many tropical plants grow to quite large sizes. In this situation, you may not have room in your home to store your plants.

        "Add water sparingly as necessary.",
        "If you have tight space constraints, you may want to lightly prune away large limbs or growths.",
        "In most cases, though, heavy pruning should be saved for spring.",
        "Retain heat with mulch or ground cover.",
        "Many tropical plants will be too sensitive to survive winter weather, but some more resilient plants may be able to survive mild winters with a little help.",
        "Ground cover, like a thick layer of mulch that completely hides the plant, helps keep roots warm and alive.",
        "You might also:\nUse a frost cover, which are available at most home and garden stores.",
        "This is essentially a piece of fabric used to completely cover and protect plants from cold damage.",
        "Even an old blanket, carefully wrapped around a plant, can work as a frost cover.",
        "Be careful your cover doesn't crush the plant.",
        "Build or purchase a cold frame or hoophouse for your plants.",
        "These are simple structures that permit good light while keeping frost at bay.",
        "Remove mulch and allow your plants to regrow.",
        "When the weather returns to suitable conditions for your covered, hibernating plants, use a shovel, rake, or hand spade to remove the mulch.",
        "Be especially careful not to damage the roots.",
        "To give your plants the best chance of growing back, you may want to use fertilizer.",
        "Be sure you water the plants adequately, so they have enough nutrients for the spring re-growth phase.",
        "When waiting for your plants to come out of hibernation and regrow, try to be patient.",
        "Some plants may take up to two months to start regrowing.",
        "Using Bulbs, Tubers, and Corms to Regrow Plants Identify plants that can be replanted.",
        "Many kinds of tropical plant produce special structures, called bulbs, tubers, and corms, from which the plant can be regrown.",
        "These are generally found in the ground or at the base of the stem.",
        "Common tropicals that produce these kind of structures include:\nElephant ear\nCannas\nCaladium Wait until the first light frost.",
        "This is the ideal time to harvest regrowing material.",
        "After the first light frost, the leaves of your plants should be slightly brown.",
        "This shows that the plant has entered its dormant phase.",
        "At this point, you should:\nUse garden shears or a spade to cut stems to approximately 6\" (15.2 cm) long.",
        "Then, carefully dig up the plant.",
        "Gather all tubers, bulbs, and corms.",
        "These are generally bulbous growths at the base of the stem.",
        "Overwinter your regrowing material.",
        "There are many techniques you might use for storing bulbs, tubers, and corms.",
        "In most cases, you should wash excess soil from the regrowing material with warm water and allow it to air dry.",
        "Then:\nSpread out regrowing material in containers with good ventilation, like milk or bread crates.",
        "Keep material separate and pack it with peat moss, wood chips, or sawdust.",
        "Store your packed crates in a cool, dark place with a temperature that is consistently 40 to 50\u00b0F (4.4 to 10\u00b0C).",
        "Every month, check your regrowing material.",
        "Remove and throw away rotten plant matter, and rejuvenate shriveled matter with a light mist of water.",
        "Plant your tropical plants when summer arrives.",
        "The ideal planting condition will depend on the kind of tropical plant you are growing.",
        "Generally, regrowing material should be planted in holes as wide as the plant matter and 2 to 3\" (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep.",
        "After planting, you'll have to care for your plant according to its needs.",
        "This may involve things like regular pruning, watering, and fertilizing.",
        "Some of your regrowing material may not sprout.",
        "It's not uncommon for a few plants to fail."
