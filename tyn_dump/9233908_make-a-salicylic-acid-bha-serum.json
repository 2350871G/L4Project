Jojoba, grapeseed, and argan oil are good for oily or acne-prone skin. Avocado, rosehip seed, and sweet almond oil are good for dry or sensitive skin. Apricot and sunflower oil are good carrier oils for normal skin types. You can use two carrier oils if you want to (i.e. if you want the acne-fighting power of grapeseed oil and the moisturizing properties of avocado oil). Just use half of each in your recipe, rather than the full amount of one."

If you do decide to use them, you can stick with just one, or add a few drops of three or four different kinds. Regardless of how many you use, pick essential oils that will be good for your skin type. Choose patchouli, rosemary, or tea tree oil for oily or acne-prone skin. Frankincense, jasmine, and sandalwood oil are good for dry or sensitive skin. Geranium and lavender essential oils are good for all skin types. Test a small amount of each oil on a different part of your skin. If your skin starts to burn, sting, or turn red, you may not not want to use that oil. If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor before using essential oils."
