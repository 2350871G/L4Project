If you want to clean the driftwood up, remove any weakened pieces of the driftwood. Either put on gloves and remove the pieces by hand, or use a chisel or scraping tool to break off the sections you want to remove. You may want to do this if you\u2019re preserving a single piece of natural driftwood or don\u2019t want any weak chunks of wood snapping off when you\u2019re sculpting it."

Fill the bin with enough of your bleach solution to completely submerge the driftwood.Tip: You have to do this if you want to preserve the driftwood. The bleach kills off any bacteria or pests that are hiding inside of the wood. Bugs and bacteria tend to build up inside driftwood, which will cause it to rot over time. Bleaching and cleaning the wood removes all of that junk. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water if you get any bleach on your skin."

        "If you\u2019re using your driftwood for an art project or sculpture, go ahead and do your work now.",
        "Sealing the wood in an epoxy resin will preserve anything underneath it, so you need to complete that fun woodworking or art project before first before doing this.",
        "You don\u2019t need to do anything to the wood if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "Many people enjoy using raw pieces of driftwood as a centerpiece on a table or as an accent piece on a bare wall.",

        "Regardless of the finish that you choose, it\u2019s best to keep your hands clean while you work.",
        "This is particularly important if you\u2019re using an epoxy resin to finish the driftwood, since it\u2019s usually spread out by hand.These finishes aren\u2019t toxic, but you can put a dust mask on if you tend to be bothered by the smell of chemicals.",
        "Use a 2-part epoxy resin if you want a thicker, stronger finish.",
        "Mix the 2 epoxies together in a plastic bowl or cup.",

        "Move the bowl or cup toward the other end of the wood to spread a thick bead over the surface.",
        "Either spread the epoxy out by hand or use a brush to move it over the wood until you\u2019ve applied a thin layer of resin.Let the resin dry for at least 72 hours to fully cure to the wood.",
        "The thicker the epoxy layer is, the more plastic and reflective your wood will look.",
        "Some people really like this look, while others prefer to keep the wood looking as natural as possible.",
        "The driftwood should last for decades.",
        "Epoxy resin is actually what builders use to repair antique wood in historic homes, so there\u2019s plenty of evidence that your wood will hold up just fine over time.",
        "Opt for a wood varnish or stain to change the color of the wood.",
        "Any varnish or stain that you can use on other types of wood can be applied to driftwood.",
        "Varnish tends to leave a slicker finish behind while stains will actively change the color of the wood.",
        "Get a varnish or stain and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to apply it to your wood.",
        "Typically, this is done by applying 2-3 layers of the liquid with a paint brush.Wait 48 hours for the wood to completely dry after applying a varnish or stain.",
        "Driftwood is extremely porous\u2014even more so than other varieties of wood.",
        "It may take multiple layers of a thinner varnish or stain to actually see the layer on the surface of the wood.",
        "Using a varnish or stain will protect the driftwood from surface scratches and minor wear and tear.",
        "Choose a furniture oil or liquid wood wax to preserve the natural appearance.",

        "Follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the label to apply a wax or oil.",
        "Typically, you use a brush to apply thin layers and build them up on the surface as needed.",
