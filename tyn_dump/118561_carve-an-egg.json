Once you're comfortable with chicken or goose eggs, try more difficult eggs like small robin's eggs or thick ostrich eggs."

    "text": " Blowing out the Yolk Choose an egg to carve. Expect to break a few eggs when you're just starting out, and factor that into what type of eggs you buy. Chicken eggs will likely be your least expensive option, but goose eggs provide a larger shell to work with. Also consider what you want your final result to look like; do you want an egg that's brown, white, or speckled? Once you're comfortable with chicken or goose eggs, try more difficult eggs like small robin's eggs or thick ostrich eggs. Tape both ends of the egg. Cut off two small pieces of clear tape and adhere one on the top, or \u201cpointy\u201d end of the egg. Place the other piece on the bottom, or \u201cflat\u201d end of the egg. The tape will help to prevent cracks when you make your holes. Poke two holes with a needle or pin. Pierce the shell through the top piece of tape and wiggle the needle or pin around to make the hole slightly larger. Flip the egg upside down over a bowl to catch anything that drips out. Then make another hole in the egg through the bottom piece of tape. Break the yolk with a toothpick. You\u2019ll need to scramble the egg\u2019s contents to get them to drip out the hole. Stick a toothpick through one of the holes (you may have to widen it a little more with the needle) and poke the toothpick in as far as you can.

Set it straight up and down on a towel and allow any remaining water inside to drip out as the egg dries. Carving the Egg Draw your design with a pencil. Sketch a design lightly on the outside of the egg, using polka dots, hearts, teardrop shapes, or anything you like. Plan to leave attachments as you would in a stencil or the entire egg will fall apart or cave in. You can also sketch a design on paper or print one off your computer and then use transfer paper to trace it onto the egg. Start with a simple pattern for your first egg and then work your way up to more complex designs. Put on a dust mask and safety goggles. Since you\u2019ll be using an engraving tool, you should wear a dust mask to make sure you don\u2019t inhale any particles from the shell. Wear safety glasses or goggles as well to protect your eyes from any flying pieces. Fit a fine bit onto an engraving tool. Engravers and tips can be purchased at craft stores and some hobby stores.
