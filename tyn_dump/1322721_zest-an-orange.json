Once you reach the end of the board, lift up the orange and place it at the top of the zester again. Try to avoid pulling the orange from the bottom of the zester to the top, which can clog the holes or damage the skin of the orange. If you\u2019re having trouble holding the orange while you zest it, cut the orange in half and squeeze the juice into a cup to make it smaller and easier to hold in your hand. Without the juice in the orange, the rind will be more pliable, and you can mold it into a shape that\u2019s comfortable for you to hold."

If you are using a box grater, simply place the grater on top of the cutting board. This will stabilize the grater for easier zesting, and it will allow you to see how much zest you\u2019ve made as you\u2019re working. Scrape the orange along the grater from top to bottom.

Rest the tip of the microplane against your cutting board, and hold the handle in your non-dominant hand. This will help to stabilize the microplane while you use it, and it will gather the zest in one place while you work. Avoid trying to zest directly into a measuring cup, since the microplane will gather the zest in the long groove under the plane until it falls onto the board. Slide the orange along the microplane with light pressure. Lightly press the orange against the microplane and scrape it from the handle toward the cutting board.

Using a Vegetable Peeler or Knife Hold the peeler or knife against the skin and slide it across the rind. Press down hard enough so that you remove the top layer of the rind, using the same motion that you would to peel a potato. Make sure that the peeler or knife is just slightly under the skin, but not touching the pith. After your first peel, check the zest to make sure there\u2019s no white pith.

When you\u2019re using a peeler, you can get very long pieces of zest. These are perfect for cocktail recipes, or using as a garnish on a plate. Chop the peel into smaller pieces for use in a recipe.
