Once the kitten's eyes open, you can start to touch and interact with it. This usually happens when the kitten is around 2 weeks old. If the mother cat trusts you, you should be able to touch the kittens starting when they're 3 days old. However, if the mother cat growls, hisses, or seems uneasy about the interaction, it's best to leave the kittens alone."

If you prefer, place a little of the wet food on the end of your clean finger and hold it out to the kitten. The kitten will begin develop positive associations between the wet food and you.
