You don\u2019t want anything sticking to the wet paint and ruining your paint job. Make sure you will be painting in a well-ventilated area. Put drop clothes or cardboard on the floor to protect it from spilled paint. Remove the door from the wall. Have someone help you with this task by holding the door as you remove the hinge pins with a flat screwdriver by pressing up lightly. Then unscrew the hinges with a screwdriver or drill. Place the door on sawhorses or on the floor. Leave the door on its hinges if it is a flat door. You can also leave a paneled door on its hinges, though it might result in more paint runs than laying the door flat. Leaving on its hinges makes it possible to paint both sides of the door at once, instead of waiting for it to dry and then flipping it. Clean the door with a liquid deglosser and a rag. If the door is dusty, dirty, or greasy, the paint won\u2019t stick as well. Focus especially on cleaning around the door knob. After you\u2019ve wiped down the door, wipe it dry with a clean rag. Wear rubber gloves when handling deglossers, primers, and paint. One cleaner you could use is TSP (trisodium phosphate), which is a powder you dissolve in warm water. Protect the door hinges and knobs. You can either remove them, or cover them with rubber cement or tape. Make sure you keep the screws with the fixtures you have removed in a safe place, so that you'll be able to put them on again when you are done. Sanding and Priming Determine if the door is painted with oil-based or latex paint. Rub a little rubbing alcohol onto the door, and if the paint comes off, it is latex. If it\u2019s latex you can skip the following sanding and priming steps, though you\u2019ll have to sand and prime if the paint is oil-based.

Let the primer dry before painting. Your primer should be a similar shade to the final paint color. Make sure to use interior primer for your interior door.

Wipe off the door with a damp cloth to remove any sawdust and let the door dry again before painting. Painting the Door Stir your paint and pour it into a roller tray. Paint cans are usually pretty clearly marked if they are for exterior or interior use, so make sure you have interior paint before beginning. Stir the paint well using a stirring stick until it\u2019s not separated and doesn't have lumps. Use a 9-inch roller to paint the whole door if it doesn\u2019t have panels. Mix the paint with a stirring stick and pour it into a roller tray. Roll with long, even strokes. Be sure to paint in the same direction as the wood grain. Paint the edges of the door last.
