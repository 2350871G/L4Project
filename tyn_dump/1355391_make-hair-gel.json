Allow the seeds to soak for at least 6 to 8 hours, preferably overnight. You don't have to do this if you are in a hurry, but it will help the seeds release more gel. Flax seeds produce a gel that works wonderfully on curly, coarse or frizzy hair. It adds shine and tames flyaways. Flax seeds are available at most grocery stores and health food stores. Make sure you get raw, unflavored flax seeds that have not been toasted or flavored with spices."
