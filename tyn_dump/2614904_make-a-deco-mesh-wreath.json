Twist them enough so that they are securely held in place, but make sure to leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of free pipe cleaner on each end. Use a color that roughly matches the color of your deco mesh ribbon so that the pipe cleaners blend in better. The exact number of pipe cleaners you use will depend on the size frame you use.

Add more pipe cleaners, placing them in any empty spaces created by the first layer. Try to position the pipe cleaners evenly apart. Fix the second layer to the frame with the same method used to fix the first layer on. Pinch even lengths of the ribbon and twist the new pipe cleaners around these pinched-off portions. Attach additional decorations. Depending on the occasion, you can attach small ornaments, feathers, fabric flowers, small flags, or a variety of other crafting decorations to the wreath. Use clear-drying craft glue to attach light decorations, like feathers. These decorations can be glued to the frame or to the ribbon.

A large red bow can be glued to the bottom center. You can make a Halloween wreath by attaching black ornaments, plastic spiders, and fake webbing to the wreath. Using Multiple Colors Attach your first color. Wrap the end of the deco mesh ribbon around the frame, holding it in place by wrapping floral wire or a thin piece of metal wire around the end. Fold the end of the ribbon under itself to mask the raw edges. Use wire that roughly matches the color of your metal frame or one of the ribbon colors. For standard size wreaths with multiple colors, 6-inch (15-cm) deco mesh ribbon should be a good size. Wrap the first ribbon around the frame. Wrap the ribbon around the frame.

Space the second ribbon in sections that are even with the sections used for the first ribbon. Attach the second ribbon to the frame by using the same thin wire used to attach the first ribbon. Weave in other colors. Use additional deco mesh ribbon to fill in any remaining gaps on your wreath. Three or four colors will usually look best, but you can use fewer or more depending on the look you want. You could also fill in the gaps using a color already used on your wreath.

Unroll a length of deco mesh ribbon, curling it as you go so that it forms a tube. The diameter of the tube should be 9 to 10 inches (23 to 25 cm) wide. Cut the deco mesh to separate the curl from the rest of the spool. You will need roughly 72 individual curls of deco mesh ribbon to create a full wreath.

You can use more than this if you want more colors. Form bunches of deco mesh curls. Hold four curls of deco mesh ribbon together at the center. Fix them together with a pipe cleaner that matches one of the colors. For a smaller, less full wreath, create bunches with two or three curls of deco mesh. Twist the pipe cleaner around the deco mesh curls enough to hold them together securely. Leave enough excess pipe cleaner at the ends to fix the ribbons onto the wreath. Attach the first bunch. Tie the center of the bunch to the inner ring of the frame by twisting the pipe cleaner ends around the wire. Twist the pipe cleaners enough to hold the deco mesh in place. Fluff up the curls once the bunch is attached. Gently bend and position the curls so that half face inward diagonally and half face outward diagonally. For this project, a 24-inch (61-cm) metal wreath frame works best. Attach the remaining bunches. Place the bunches around the frame, spacing them apart evenly and twisting them in place using the remaining pipe cleaner ends. The bunches should be placed a little more than 1 inch (2.5-cm) apart from one another. It may help to leave a little bit of \"wiggle room\" between the pipe cleaner and the metal frame. Doing so will allow you to glide the bunches around and reposition them as needed. You can always make the twist tighter after the bunches are all arranged as you would like them to be.

        "Fix them together with a pipe cleaner that matches one of the colors.",
        "For a smaller, less full wreath, create bunches with two or three curls of deco mesh.",
        "Twist the pipe cleaner around the deco mesh curls enough to hold them together securely.",
        "Leave enough excess pipe cleaner at the ends to fix the ribbons onto the wreath.",
        "Attach the first bunch.",
        "Tie the center of the bunch to the inner ring of the frame by twisting the pipe cleaner ends around the wire.",
        "Twist the pipe cleaners enough to hold the deco mesh in place.",
        "Fluff up the curls once the bunch is attached.",
        "Gently bend and position the curls so that half face inward diagonally and half face outward diagonally.",
        "For this project, a 24-inch (61-cm) metal wreath frame works best.",
        "Attach the remaining bunches.",
        "Place the bunches around the frame, spacing them apart evenly and twisting them in place using the remaining pipe cleaner ends.",
        "The bunches should be placed a little more than 1 inch (2.5-cm) apart from one another.",
        "It may help to leave a little bit of \"wiggle room\" between the pipe cleaner and the metal frame.",
        "Doing so will allow you to glide the bunches around and reposition them as needed.",
        "You can always make the twist tighter after the bunches are all arranged as you would like them to be.",
        "Attach the bunches to both the inner and outer wires of the frame for a full wreath.",
        "Fluff the curls.",
        "Bend and reposition the curls so that some face diagonally inward and others face diagonally outward.",
        "The end result should be a full wreath with no empty space in the center and none of the wire frame visible."
