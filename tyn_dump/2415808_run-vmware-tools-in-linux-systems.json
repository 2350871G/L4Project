To begin, open the \"VM\" tab of the VMware application itself (not Linux) and select \"Install VMware tools.\" Find a volume on your desktop named \"VMware Tools\". Open this by double-clicking, and inside you should see 2 items. A \"manifest.txt\" and a .tar.gz file. Drag the .tar.gz file to your desktop for easy access. Your screen should now look like this. Open the Working Directory. Now, we will open the terminal (Applications > System Tools > Terminal). The following are commands to install VMware Tools and need to be typed accurately, so be careful. All commands will be put in quotations. Start with the command \"cd Desktop\" and press enter. This will make our working directory on the Desktop where we have the VMware tools volume. Unpack it. Now type the command \"tar -zxvf VM*\" and press enter. You will see a lot of output on your screen, and it will run for a few seconds. Do not try to interrupt it, it is simply unpacking the VMware Tools files we need to continue. Log in as Root User. Once your prompt returns (you see the $) type \"su root\" and press enter. This is logging us in as the root user, or superuser of the system. It will then ask you for the root password of the Linux system. The prompt won't display your the characters you type, so you may make a typo like seen in the visual. Enter your root password and press enter. You will then see your prompt return with a # instead of a $. Run the Installation. Now type \"./vm*/vm*\" and press enter. This runs the installation of VMware Tools.
