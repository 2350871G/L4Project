The accelerator cable is a metal braided cable that links the gas pedal to the engine. You can loosen it with a wrench. The PCV valve hose goes into the valve cover. You can usually loosen it by hand and then set it off to the side. Put the hardware in a magnetic bowl so you don\u2019t lose any important pieces. If the valve cover seems stuck after you\u2019ve taken out the bolts, use a hammer to gently tap it loose.Wear Your Protective Gear: Because you\u2019ll be sanding down aluminum, it\u2019s really important that you use a face shield or protective eyewear and a face mask to protect your eyes and lungs. You should also wear heavy work gloves and closed-toed shoes."

Start with 180-grit sandpaper for a coarser finish to begin smoothing out the surface of the valve cover. Run the sandpaper over the surface 2-3 times until you can visually notice a difference in the texture of the cover. To get a great shine on the valve cover, you\u2019ll use progressively finer and finer grits of sandpaper until the surface of the cover is shiny and smooth to the touch.Try an Alternative: If you don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t have the ability to sand the valve cover, you can use a piece of steel wool instead. It\u2019ll take a lot of elbow grease, but it can be done! Scrub the entire valve cover over and over again with the steel wool until it is smooth to the touch."

You can use a small bevel sander to smooth out those parts, or you could use a smaller piece of sandpaper or steel wool to do it by hand. This makes the cover look nice and unified, but it also prevents rust from forming around the hardware once the valve cover is back in your vehicle."

If you haven\u2019t used a buffing wheel and polishing compound before, the key is to apply a small quarter-sized amount of compound to the wheel and replace it often throughout the buffing process.
