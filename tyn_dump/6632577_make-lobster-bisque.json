If you're using frozen lobster tails, you'll need to thaw the tails completely before beginning. You'll likely need to cut through the top shell first, followed by the bottom shell. Cut through the lobster meat after splitting the shell, following the edge of the divided shell. The lobster meat should remain in the shell after you finish cutting the tails in half.
