How many details you include will depend on how many times that character appears in the story. If the guy behind the grocery store counter is only noticed once, don't detail him out too much. Give a description and maybe a name. But if he's your main character, include details right down to if they drink coffee and when! A good template to use is:\nName, Age, Height, Weight, Role in Story, Eye color, Hair color, Skin tone, Habits, Identifying feature, Past, Present, Future, and Theme Song."

The beginning should be an introduction to future events and the life of your character. The middle should be the problem your character must face and should include a high point where an important decision must be made (or a climax), and the end should be a cool down that wraps up loose ends and leaves readers hungry for your next great work! If you get stuck on finding a plot, read some of your favorite mystery novels to get ideas. Also, keep your eyes and ears open for new ideas and topics to write about. Use a system of ten scenes to map out your plot. Write each scene separately and connect them with pages in between. Scene one should be an opening scene. Two through four should be complications, and five should be point of no return complication. Six through ten should be solutions and wrap ups."

In a ghost story, they should be shocking, like the sudden disappearance of a person in the dark or a ghostly hand on one's shoulder.
