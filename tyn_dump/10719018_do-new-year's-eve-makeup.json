Underline your lower lid with shadow as well, applying a thin, blurred line just below your lower lashes. Blend the top and bottom eyeshadow just a bit with your fingers to give it a softer, more natural line. Blurring it just past the outer corner of your eye will start creating the smoky effect. Blend your eyeshadow with a darker shade, swirling it into the crease. Choose a slightly darker eyeshadow. Start at the outer corner and blend it into your lid going along the crease. Start to blend it into center of your eyelid, and move towards the outer edge so there is less eyeshadow on the inner corner than on the outer corner. Then, use a blending brush or your fingers to create a subtle, smoky effect. Continue to create a subtle wing out from the corner of your eye as well, using a large eyeshadow brush to blend the two shades.Tip: For an even more festive look, dab some shimmery gold eyeshadow on your top lid. Outline your lids with eyeliner. Run a black eye pencil or liquid eyeliner over the edge of your eyelid, just above the lash line. Rim your lower lash line as well to make your eyes really pop. You can create a subtle cat eye by winging your eyeliner out from the corner of your eye, which will help to play up the smoky look. Apply mascara to play up your lashes. To finish up your eye makeup, simply brush some mascara onto your top and bottom lashes. Go over the lashes a few times to get maximum volume and intensity. Mascara will help your eyes look brighter and larger, making them stand out in your smokey eye look. Apply rose lip liner and lipstick to finish the look. Line your lips with a dark pink lip pencil, then fill them in with a rose-colored lipstick. You can apply straight from the tube or use a thin makeup brush for better control. Simply dab the brush against the tube, then paint it onto your lips. The dusky color of the lipstick will match your eyeshadow and draw attention to both your eyes and mouth.",
