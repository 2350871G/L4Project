Let them help you up and say your in tons of pain. Show that your leg/arm/shoulder is hurting really bad, and that you make sure that your parents are taking you to the doctors in the morning or something along those lines.  Get a pair of crutches if you can. If they ask you why, then you just simply lie that you need them for a school project (example: you are reenacting a play in class). Arrive at school with the crutches and tell everyone how you got hurt.  What will also look good is if you have bruises, so that when people ask what happened you can tell them and show the bruises.  Hurt Ankle Method Get an ace bandage without your mom knowing. You don't have to spend up to $10 at Walmart, just buy a $2 one at the local pharmacy. Get a pair of flats or flip-flops to wear them on the day that you want to be \"hurt\". It would look really weird if you wore sneakers with an ace bandage around your leg. Wrap the bandage around your ankle a few times, then wrap it around the base of your foot (the part between the toes and your heel). Alternate until the bandage is too short to go any further. Tuck it in at the top, pin it in place, or step on it to hold it in place. Make up a good excuse and make sure it's realistic. like \"I was riding my bike and ran into a trash can\" not \"I was hit by a bus\". Hurt Arm Method Get an ace bandage, wrap it around your forearm and slowly move up to your wrist.  Go over your fingers and back down to your wrist.  Secure in place as stated above.  Hurt Shoulder Method Get an ace bandage and wrap it around your chest a couple times. Girls, you can wear a bra while you do this unless you're actually hurt. Go up to your upper arm and keep going until you go over your shoulder and to your neck.  Secure the bandage in place as stated above.  Hit Head Method Get an ice pack and put it in your locker beforehand.  In the class before the one you want to skip, pretend to fall and hit your head on a desk/floor/locker/wall and grimace in pain. Pretend to cry if you don't mind the indignity. When you go to your locker, get the ice pack and press it to your head.  When you get to the class you don't want to do, put on a realistic look of agony. If the teacher asks you what's wrong, tell him/her you fell and hit your head.
