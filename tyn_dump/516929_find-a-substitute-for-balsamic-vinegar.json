    "text": " Using What You Have Know that balsamic vinegar has a unique taste. There is no true substitute for it. You may be able to find or mix something together that tastes similar, but you won't be able to get the exact same taste. This section will give you a few items that have a similar taste. Choose the one that appeals the most to you. Combine 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and \u00bd teaspoon of sugar in a small cup. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves. You can also heat the mixture in a small pot to help the sugar dissolve. Allow the vinegar to cool completely before you use it in your recipe. Mix 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar with \u00bd teaspoon of sugar in a small cup. Keep mixing until the sugar dissolves. You can also heat the mixture in a small pot until the sugar melts. Let the vinegar cool before you use it. Use five parts vinegar to one part sugar. Any type of vinegar will do. Heat the two ingredients in a small pot to dissolve the sugar. Let the vinegar cool before using it in your recipe. Chinese black vinegar will work well. Fruity vinegar will also work. Try any of the following: apple cider, pomegranate, or raspberry. Try a balsamic vinaigrette instead. It may have additional ingredients, such as oils, herbs, and sugars, but it will have the same basic taste. If you are making a salad dressing using balsamic vinegar, you can use the vinaigrette instead of your recipe. Try using another type of vinegar. Another dark vinegar may give you a similar taste to balsamic. Consider any of the following vinegars:\nBrown rice vinegar\nChinese black vinegar\nRed wine vinegar\nSherry wine vinegar\nMalt vinegar Making a Substitute Mix equal parts of lemon juice and molasses in a small bowl. If you can't find any molasses, use brown rice syrup instead. Mix just enough for the recipe. For example, if your recipe calls for 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar, use 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of molasses. Add a dash of soy sauce. Stir everything together with a fork. Make any adjustments, if needed. Give your substitute a taste. If it tastes too sour, add some more molasses or brown rice syrup. If it is too sweet, add more lemon juice. Add the mixture to your recipe in place of the balsamic vinegar.  Making Elderberry Vinegar Grind 400 grams (4 cups) of ripe elderberries in a bowl. Use a fork, the end of a rolling pin, or even the back of a spoon to do this. You want to break the skin and expose the flesh and juice. Pour 500 milliliters (2 cups) of red wine vinegar over the elderberries. Make sure that the berries are completely covered. Cover the bowl and leave it alone for five days. Keep the bowl in a cool place where it will not be disturbed. If it is warm in the room, move it to the fridge. Pour the mixture through a sieve into a saucepan. Mash the berries against the sieve to get any excess juice and vinegar out. Once you are done, toss the berries. Stir in 700 grams (3 cups) of sugar and heat the mixture over medium heat. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves. Bring the mixture to a boil, then simmer it for 10 minutes. As soon as the vinegar starts to boil, reduce the heat to a simmer. Stir the mixture often with a spoon. If you don't, the sugar may scorch or caramelize. Pour the mixture into a dark colored bottle. Use a funnel to help guide the mixture into the bottle.
