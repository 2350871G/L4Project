Locate the Tech Deck logo on the grip tape and start dotting away at it with the permanent marker.  Do NOT colour, just dot it, it looks a lot better and doesn't wreck your permanent marker.  Do this until you can't see the Tech Deck logo anymore.

Cut a line in the grip tape (easy way) Grab scissors or a sharp knife and  Locate the two pairs of bolts on any end of the board (They are on the two ends of the grip tape)  Look about half an inch closer to the middle of the board.  Do slow, but sure vertical cuts on this area. The cut should be about a third of the width of your fingernail - approx. 5 mm in width. Make sure you cut the whole area vertically, as in no grip tape left in that 5 mm width of area. This looks pretty awesome and, if you wish, you can then colour the line with different coloured permanent markers, and then even go on to the rim of the deck! Cut a line in the grip tape (hard way) Take the grip tape off the deck but without ripping it. An easy way to do this is to soak the board in hot water for about 5 min. This burns out some of the glue holding the grip tape to the board. Try to get your fingernail under the board and just very, very carefully, pull away.
