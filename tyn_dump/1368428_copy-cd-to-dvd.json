            "description": "You can do this by putting your CD in your disc drive, opening up \"My Computer,\" selecting your disc drive and dragging everything from your CD into a folder on your desktop (or another preferred location). Repeat this with all of your CDs that you want to replace with DVDs. Make sure that you organize your files well by perhaps making a different folder for each CD. This will make it easier to avoid burning repeated material to your DVD. If you want to backup a game install disc or audio files, you may need to rip the CD to your hard drive. Often it's not enough to simply copy the files (because the disc may be copy protected). To do this, download a CD ripping program (like CloneDVD or any number of free ones). If you have an audio CD any media program can rip the files to your computer. To backup a game you need to rip an image to your computer, usually in the form of an .iso file. An .iso file is simply an image of the CD and can be mounted on a virtual CD drive or copied to another disc to make an exact clone of the original."
