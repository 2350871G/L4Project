                    "description": "A mother rabbit can be very secretive; she leaves the nest during the day to keep predators away. She has not abandoned her babies. If you find a nest of bunnies leave them alone. If it is obvious that they need help (the mother is dead on the road, for instance), you will need to take them to a vet or wildlife rehabilitator. A wild cottontail (US) rabbit may have a white spot on its forehead. Some babies are born without any spot. Some rabbits will retain the star or blaze throughout life and others will lose it as they age. The presence or absence of a blaze does not indicate the bunny's age or need for care. In the case of a baby rabbit which is being removed from a dangerous situation (such as a predator), consider this a temporary measure. Keep the baby in a safe, quiet place until the danger has passed, then simply return it to the area where it was found. A mother rabbit will not reject a baby if it has human scent on it. This is the rabbit's best chance for survival. However, if the baby has been attacked by a cat, any wound contaminated by a claw or tooth will KILL the baby within a few days. It needs to be taken to a wildlife rehabilitator or a veterinarian and given a rabbit-safe antibiotic."

The mixture should be thick as mother rabbit's milk is thicker than most other small mammals. This usually means approximately 3 parts solids (by volume) to 4 parts distilled water. Do not warm the formula directly, but warm water in a container and float the formula container in that. Use an eye dropper or better yet a syringe with a mini Miracle nipple attached.

Use careful sanitation procedures after handling the wild rabbit, or its waste, especially if you have other rabbits. Keep the bunnies in this box until they don't need the heat any more.  Planning to Feed the Rabbits Feed formula to Cottontail rabbits with closed eyes. If a rabbit is hopping about, it may need only constant access to fresh greens, hay and water. You can offer formula in a shallow dish even to older bunnies. Once it is eating the greens (no pesticides or herbicides) well and hopping and running about, it is ready to be released in an area preferably with lots of cover for this little prey animal.

General guidelines for feeding amounts:\nNewborn to one week old: 2-2.5 cc/ml each feeding, twice per day\n1-2 weeks old: 5-7 cc/ml each feeding, twice per day (less if the rabbit is very small)\n2-3 weeks: 7-10 cc/ml each feeding, twice per day (less if the rabbit is very small)\nAt 2-3 weeks, also start introducing them to 'timothy hay', oat hay, pellets and water (add fresh greens for wild rabbits)\n3-6 weeks: 10 cc/ml each feeding twice per day - other foodstuffs should now be making up most of the diet Stop feeding formula at the appropriate time.

Wild Jackrabbits wean after 9 weeks, so after 9 weeks slowly replace formula with a dish of cut up tiny bananas and apple pieces. Feeding a Newborn Bunny Bunny Formula using Cream-Bunny milk is very thick and very high in protein and fat.  1.5 tablespoons KMR (powdered kitten milk replacer)  2 tablespoons water  1 teaspoon cream  Mix together thoroughly and store in refrigerator. Heat only what you are going to feed at one time (or a little more if you are going to offer it in a shallow dish in bunny's box). Do NOT put any leftovers back in the original batch. This stuff is good for only 24 hours. Then discard and make fresh. You do not have to feed this by syringe or medicine dropper. You can furnish it in shallow dishes for them to drink on their own. Many bunnies prefer it this way once their eyes are open. Be very gentle and slow. Allow the bunnies to feed at their own pace, and be very gentle while handling them. If you try to get the baby to drink too fast, it could choke and die. Protect newborns who have eyes closed.  Place the nipple of the syringe in the bunny\u2019s mouth. Tilt the bunny slightly backwards to get nipple in side of mouth and then swing around to front. Gently depress plunger of syringe to allow a small amount of formula to come out. The bunny should swallow and then start sucking. If it doesn't, continue to feed a drop or two at a time. Stimulate newborn rabbits\u2019 bowels. Newborn cottontails need to be stimulated to urinate following the feeding.

When the rabbits are somewhat self-sufficient, wean them off of formula and allow them to feed themselves grass and other vegetation. Be sure the bunnies are an appropriate weaning age (3-5 weeks for cottontails and 9+ weeks for wild Jackrabbits). Stop handling the bunnies. The bunnies need to prepare for being released into the wild, so you should stop touching them if at all possible. They will become less dependent on you and more self-sufficient. Move the bunnies outdoors full time. Place them in a wire cage with a roof outside of your home. This cage must be sturdy as wild predators will try to get at the little rabbits. A double cage is ideal. The little rabbits MUST have a place to hide within the cage to make them feel safe. A just-big-enough box will work..  Be sure that the bottom of the cage is wire, so they can graze, and check that all the holes are small enough that they cannot slip through. Move the cage to different spots in your yard so that the bunnies have a regular supply of new vegetation. Continue to supply extra vegetation in addition to the grass. Move the bunnies to a larger hutch as they grow. Upgrade them into a larger hutch outside on the grass and continue to feed them all the extra veggies twice a day. Release the bunnies into the wild. When the bunnies are about eight or nine inches long in a sitting position, they are big enough to be released into the wild in a safe place. If they are not self-sufficient, keep them a little longer, but do not let them grow to maturity in captivity. Call your local wildlife conservation office for help. If a rabbit that is big enough to release still cannot provide for itself, call an expert. They will know what to do for your particular situation.",
