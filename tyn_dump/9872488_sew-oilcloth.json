If you use weaker needles, they may bend or snap. You can also check the fabric store for needles designed for sewing denim. These should be strong enough to work with oilcloth."

You can choose a thread color that matches the fabric so it blends in, or pick a color that stands out. For example, bright green or red thread really pops against black oilcloth. If you're not concerned about having waterproof qualities, you could also use standard cotton thread."

                    "description": "Since it's easiest to use oilcloth with basic shapes such as squares or rectangles, use a straight stitch. To avoid punching too many holes in the oilcloth, use a longer stitch than you usually would. For example, adjust the machine for a 3.0 to 3.5 mm stitch. If you do plan on stitching curves, consider decreasing the length of the stitch between 2.5 and 3 mm."

You can buy a plastic teflon presser foot at most fabric supply stores. If you can't find them, stick a little masking tape on the bottom of the presser foot so it slides over the oilcloth. If you're still struggling to get the presser foot to glide, turn the fabric over so you're stitching the back of the oilcloth. This will make it easier to feed the fabric through the machine."

If you'd like a decorative look, finish the edges by cutting them with pinking shears or decorative scissors. You can also hem the edges for a classic finished look. For example, cut just the edges with zigzag edge scissors to make a fun look."
