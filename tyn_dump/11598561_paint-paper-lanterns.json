Once you have the wire frame completely in the lantern, push it underneath the metal hooks along the edge of the lantern\u2019s top hole to secure it in place. Don\u2019t leave the lantern closed when you paint it since you won\u2019t be able to get even coverage. Be careful not to poke the sides of the lantern with the wire or you will make a hole in it.

Choose the colors that you want to use for your lantern and squeeze a coin-sized amount onto your palette. Leave about 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) of space between each of the colors so you have room to mix additional colors if you need to. You can buy acrylic and watercolor paints from art stores or craft shops. Mix colors with black paint if you want darker tones, or use white paint to make lighter tints of colors.Tip: Acrylic paints may have an opaque appearance, which means they won\u2019t let as much light through the lantern as watercolor paints."

Carefully paint directly onto the lantern to add your design to it. Whenever you switch colors, rinse off your brush in the glass of water and pat it dry on the paper towel. The size of the brush you use depends on how thick you want the strokes. Get a brush set that has multiple sizes so you can try them out. Work from the lightest color to the darkest color so it\u2019s easier to apply. Paper lanterns usually have horizontal lines running across them where they were folded. Try painting horizontal stripes on your lantern using the lines as guides.Warning: Be careful not to press into the side of the lantern too hard or else you\u2019ll poke a hole through the paper."

Hold the bottle about 6 inches (15 cm) away from the lantern and pull the trigger to spray it. Rotate the lantern as you spray to get even coverage. Combine colors together to make your spray a different shade. For example, you can mix a solution of red and blue paint to get a purple spray. Be careful not to spray the mixture on anything else, or it will leave a stain. Spray clean water through the spray bottle when you\u2019re finished painting with it.

Test the color of the dye on a paper towel or scrap piece of paper to see if you\u2019re happy with the color. This works best for making pink blush paper lanterns, which have a paler tone than others. You can also just dip sections of the lantern in the dye if you want it to have polka dots or unique shapes in the design.

If you choose to spray paint, work in a well-ventilated area or outside since it can create harmful fumes. Spray paint also works great for sky lanterns.
