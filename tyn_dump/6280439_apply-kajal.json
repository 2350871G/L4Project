These formulas are ideal for people who exercise often or for people who have allergies or sensitive eyes. Waterproof versions may be more difficult to wash off, however. You can find waterproof versions of all types of kajal, even traditional powders. Using a Kajal Pencil Clean the area around your eyes. Clean skin will prevent the kajal from smudging. You can wash your face or use makeup remover to clean off any old makeup or kajal from around your eyes. Draw a line from the inner corner of your upper eyelid. With a sharpened kajal pencil, make a straight line along the lash line from your inner eye to the outer edge. Try to do this in one motion if possible. Pull down your lower lid to line under the eye. Using your ring finger, gently pull down on your lower eyelid while looking up. Start at the inner corner of your eye. Draw the pencil along either the lash line or the water line of your eye. The lash line is the area where your lashes grow. The water line is the rim of the eye between your lashes and the eye. Smudge with your finger or a brush if desired. Many kajal styles require that you smudge the kajal after applying. Using your ring finger or an eye brush, gently blend the kajal upwards towards your brow with small, repeated strokes. Putting on Kajal with a Wand or Brush Remove excess product. Whether you are working with a powder, liquid, or gel, make sure that there is no extra kajal on the wand or brush. For a powder, tap the wand gently against the bottle. For a liquid or gel, gently wipe the brush against the lid. Hold the wand or brush horizontally. When you apply the kajal, you should always hold the wand or brush sideways so that it is horizontal. The wand should line up against the lash line of your eye. Do not hold the wand vertically. Draw a line from the inner corner along the upper lash line. Start at the inner eye, and draw out the wand along the lash line towards the outer edge of your eye. Use as few strokes as possible; try to do it in one move if possible. Create a straight line along the lower lash line. Pull down the skin under your eye, and press the wand or brush to your inner eye. Gently sweep the brush along the lower lash line (if you are using gel or liquid) or water line (if you are using a powder). Thicken the kajal if desired. For a more dramatic look, you can build upon the base. Use short strokes back and forth along the original base to thicken the line of kajal. Continue until you are satisfied with your look. Styling Kajal Edge the water line of your eye for a traditional look. Using the ring finger of your non-dominant hand, gently pull down the skin beneath your lower eyelid until you see the white of your eye. With a pencil or powder, draw a line along the water line of your lower eyelid from the inner corner to the outer edge. Soften sharp lines with an eye smudger. If your kajal look is too sharp or thin, you can carefully smudge both lines by running the tip of an eye smudger brush over them. Start at the inner corner of your eye, and follow the kajal out to the edge of your eye. Create a winged cat-eye. Starting at the inner corner, draw a line along your lash line. Once you reach the outer corner of the upper lash line, draw a short line that tilts upward at a 45-degree angle. For a bolder look, go back over the entire line of kajal, and thicken it using short strokes of the pencil or wand. Smudge the kajal for a smoky eye. Close your eye, and apply a thick line to the upper lid. Take a fluffy eye shadow brush and smudge the kajal upward, working it through the crease and toward the brow bone.
