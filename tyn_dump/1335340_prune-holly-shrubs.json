There are different techniques of shaping and specific places on the shrub where you should make the cuts, so don't just start chopping. Before you get started, take a minute to review the fundamental terms and concepts pertaining to pruning. Shearing is the act of maintenance where you simply trim the outermost twigs to control length. Thinning is where you cut and remove branches throughout the shrub. Thinning is generally preferred over shearing, as exclusively shearing will encourage dense growth on the outer edges of the plant and keep sunlight from getting to inner branches. This can create a transparent or hollow look which is considered less desirable than a full, even growth. A terminal bud grows at the tip of a branch, and it sends hormones back down the rest of the shoot which inhibit the growth of other buds. This is why you want to prune: you want to clip off terminal buds in order to stem the flow of growth-inhibiting hormones and encourage growth of other, non-terminal buds. A lateral bud sprout along the side of the shoot. When cutting, you want to cut back to a lateral bud node, which is the place on the stem where the lateral bud attaches to the shoot."

You'll need to identify what kind of plant you have before you pick up the shears. If your holly plant loses its foliage every winter, it's a deciduous holly. These holly plants require radical pruning every year. If your holly plant never loses its foliage, it's an evergreen. These types of holly require more attention in the first few years of life but not as much thinning or shaping as time goes on."

This is because the size and circumference of the branches determine which kind of cutting implement you should use. Pruning shears work well on twigs and branches measuring 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) in diameter or less. A quality pair of lopping shears can cut branches measuring up to 2 inches (5 cm). Make sure to use ratchet-style pruners and avoid anvil-style. Larger limbs and branches may require the use of a pruning saw."

It's a fairly sturdy and resilient plant, though, so don't worry too much if you have to prune in a sub-optimal season. The best time to prune a deciduous holly is in spring as it produces optimal berry growth.
