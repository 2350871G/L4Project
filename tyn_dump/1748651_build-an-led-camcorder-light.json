Measure the circumference of the camcorder lens or whatever mounting point the light will attach to. Then measure the same for the elasticized fabric. Cut the elastic to the measurement. Be sure to add a couple centimeters or inches to your measurement to compensate for overlap. Using the glue gun, put a dollop of glue on the edge of the elastic strip. Overlap the two edges while forming a circle. Hold this in place till glue hardens, approximately 20 seconds.  Follow this wiring diagram for the next steps.
