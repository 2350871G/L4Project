For new businesses, this may be as simple as business cards or a business plan. A new business should complete all or most of a business plan before trying to chart their marketing needs. The managers and marketers should have intimate familiarity with the market before trying to define a marketing plan. You should have an established marketing budget, if possible."

Also, ask them what is missing in their experience, so that you can improve their experience and attract repeat customers. You can also evaluate new industry standards and innovations. Develop a detailed report that everyone involved in marketing would read."

Occasionally you may want to try to tempt a new demographic to your business. Remember that each demographic responds to marketing in a different way. One of your main needs may be to establish different campaigns for different kinds of customers. A 20 year old person would be better served by an email, but an 80 year old might require a piece of mail to alert them about a sale."
