Because the use of a speed square will vary depending on the project, create a plan specific to your needs and decide exactly where lines must be drawn. Use the square to locate and mark studs, position floor joists, lay out stair stringers, determine roof pitches, any other project that is dependent on straight lines.

When drawing lines, keep the lipped fence firmly pressed against the wood for best results. Use either side of the speed square, as both sides will have a lipped fence. The lipped fence allows you to brace the speed square flush with the wood, creating a straight or angled line that is proportionate to the wood's edge."
