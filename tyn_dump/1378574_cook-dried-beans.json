Go through your desired amount of beans before you wash them. Pay special attention to any small rocks or pebbles that may have inadvertently made their way into the packaging. Place the dried beans in a colander and wash them quickly. Run cool water over the beans for about half a minute. Soaking the Beans Use the slow soak method if you've got a night to soak your beans. The slow soak method is a preferred method of preparing beans if you've set aside enough time to soak overnight. Slow soaking ensures that the final product is fully cooked, not crunchy or underdone. If you choose the slow soak method, put the beans in a 5 qt. (4.7 l) saucepan and cover them with about 8 cups (about 2 l) of water.

If you leave your beans in cool water overnight, expect them to at least double in size. Make sure your cooking vessel is large enough to accommodate this transformation. Rinse the beans thoroughly in a colander after soaking. Your beans are now ready to be cooked. Cooking the Beans Put the beans in a large cooking pot and add enough water to completely cover them.  Add a tablespoon of vegetable or olive oil to the pot to cut down on excessive foam and boil-over while the beans are cooking. Because the beans expand while cooking, periodically adding small amounts of water to the pot will keep them adequately covered, ensuring even cooking. Simmer the dried beans on low to medium heat. Properly soaked beans usually require between 30 minutes and 2 hours of cooking. Consult the proper cooking time of the types of beans you're using.
