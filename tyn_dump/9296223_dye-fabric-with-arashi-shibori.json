    "text": " Prepping the Fabric Choose a fabric made of all natural fibers. You can dye things like blankets, sheets, pillowcases, shirts, and dresses. Cotton, wool, silk, and polyester are all natural fibers you can use. Start with a smaller item, like a shirt, bandana, or scarf, if it\u2019s your first time dyeing with the arashi shibori technique. Presoak the fabric in a baking soda bath for 15 minutes. Mix \u00bc gallon (.95 liters) of water and 1 tablespoon (14.8 mL) of baking soda in a large bowl or plastic container. Submerge the fabric in the baking soda bath. The baking soda bath will help the fabric absorb more color when you dye it. If you're dyeing a large piece of fabric, double the amount of water and baking soda you use. Fold the fabric into a rectangle. Folding your fabric in a rectangular shape will make it easier to tie onto the pole for dyeing. If the fabric you\u2019re dyeing is already square or rectangular, you can leave it as is or fold it in half once if it\u2019s big. For example, if you\u2019re dyeing a t-shirt, you would want to fold the sleeves in and then fold the shirt in half lengthwise. Attach a corner of the fabric to a cylindrical object using a rubber band. Traditional arashi shibori is done using a long wooden pole, but you can use any object that is cylindrical in shape. A PVC pipe, large mason jar, or card stock tube will work. Place a corner of the fabric flat on the cylinder so it's touching one of the ends of the object. Wrap a rubber band around the end of the cylinder and over the corner of the fabric so it\u2019s held in place. Tying Down the Fabric Attach the end of a piece of twine to the rubber band. If you don\u2019t have twine, use yarn or a thick thread instead. Loop the end of the twine through the rubber band on the cylinder. Tie a knot so the twine is secure. Wrap the twine around the cylinder and fabric. You want the twine to press the fabric flat against the surface of the cylinder. Keep wrapping the twine around, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between each loop you make. Add another rubber band after making four loops around the fabric. The second rubber band will help hold the fabric and twine in place. Slide the rubber band over the cylinder and fabric and position it right next to the last loop of twine you made. Scrunch up the fabric to make more room on the cylinder. Push the fabric up toward the end of the cylinder you started at.

Use scissors to cut the twine from the rest of the ball. Loop the loose end of the twine through one of the rubber bands on the cylinder. Adding the Dye Fill a large plastic container with near-boiling water. Use a container large enough to hold the cylinder you\u2019re dyeing the fabric on. Fill it with enough water that the entire cylinder can be submerged. Add fabric dye to the water. You can find fabric dye in a color of your choice at your local craft store. Shake the bottle of dye before you open it. Read the instructions on the back of the dye to see how much dye you should use. The more dye you use, the more saturated the color will be.

For a more precise design, use an eyedropper to apply the new dye. Spray the fabric with a fixative to preserve the dye. Do this before you take the fabric off the cylinder. You can find a dye fixative at your local craft store. Finishing Up Rinse the cylinder and fabric under cold water. Rotate the cylinder in your hands so all the fabric is getting rinsed. Continue rinsing until the water coming off the fabric runs clear. Unwrap the twine around the fabric. Pull off the rubber bands as well. Once the fabric is completely off the cylinder, set the cylinder aside. Unfold the fabric and rinse it thoroughly under cold water.
