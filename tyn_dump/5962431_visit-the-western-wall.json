In addition, keep in mind that the Wall will be more crowded than usual on Monday and Thursday mornings for Bar Mitzvah reading celebrations which are frequent, as well as Friday nights and Saturdays which is the Jewish Sabbath. You will also find the Wall virtually deserted during periods of inclement weather, such as heavy rain or snow. While it may be uncomfortable being outside at these times, it can also be a blessing for the undeterred tourist as there will be few people about, and you will have greater privacy if desired."
