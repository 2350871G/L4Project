Tape the edges of your metal sheet to the piece of paper with your template design. Place a piece of tape on all sides to ensure the page does not slip. This will ensure that your lines are true to the design. Using the stylus, trace over the lines of your template design. Use as little pressure as possible, so that you are not committed to a high relief. This cannot easily be undone, so follow the lines as close to exact as possible."
