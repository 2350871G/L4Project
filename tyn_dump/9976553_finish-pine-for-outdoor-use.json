Polyurethane finishes, on average, last between 2-3 years. If your pine's finish seems dull or you notice signs of weather damage, freshen the object up with a new finish. Painting Outdoor Pine Set up a tarp in a spot with good air circulation. Painting the pine over a tarp will catch drips and prevent you from staining anything other than your object. Look for a well-ventilated area to paint the object, preferably near a window, open door, or outside. Choose a latex or oil-based paint. Outdoor pine furniture needs added protection from UV light to prevent sun damage. Latex or oil-based paints are ideal for deflecting UV rays and staying vibrant over time. If your pine has been pressure treated, choose latex paint. Sand the surface down with fine-grit sandpaper. Before painting, rub the entire surface in circular motions with a fine-grit sandpaper. Pay special attention to any blemishes or uneven areas you notice, then wipe the surface down with a wet cloth afterward to get rid of shavings or sandpaper dust.

Let the primer dry for 30-60 minutes before painting the pine object. Apply 2-3 coats of paint. Coat the object's surface in layers using a paintbrush or with the same technique that you applied the paint primer, depending on whether you're using spray paint.

Apply a layer of paint sealant over the coats to protect the new coats and prevent weather damage. How often you'll need new paint coats depends on how sunny and hot your climate is. If you decide to paint it a new color, use a paint stripper to remove all of the previous coats first. Sealing Pine with Epoxy Apply epoxy in a well-ventilated room with a tarp underneath. Epoxy has a strong scent, so find a spot outdoors or near an open door to apply the finish. As with applying paint and polyurethane finishes, layout a tarp underneath your workspace to catch drips and avoid staining the floor. If you're sensitive to chemical smells, wear a respirator while working. Apply a coat of epoxy with a putty knife. Dip your putty knife in an epoxy container and spread it along the pine's surface. Use the putty knife to flatten out any bumps, bubbles, or thick areas as you even the first coat. Use a spoon to fill in holes any holes or uneven areas as you go, smoothing it over with the putty knife. Wait for the epoxy to dry and check for uneven areas. Let your first coat dry, then inspect its surface. Cutaway bumps, rough patches, or bubbles with a razor blade, then smooth it out by rubbing fine-grit sandpaper in even motions over its surface. Epoxy takes approximately 24 hours to dry enough for additional coats. Apply at least 3 coats of epoxy finish. Adding 3 coats is recommended to protect the wood and give it a glossy shine. Wait 24 hours between coats, smoothing away any uneven areas as needed before applying the next one. Set the epoxy aside to cure for 4-5 days. When you've finished applying coats, find a spot where the object can sit without being disturbed. Let the epoxy cure for 4-5 days, depending on the package's instructions, so the epoxy has time to harden. Avoid touching the object or placing it outside until the epoxy cures, if possible. Apply a top coat of wood varnish over the epoxy. After the epoxy has cured, add a thin coat of varnish using a paintbrush. Apply the varnish in long, even strokes to give the object a smooth, sturdy finish. Add up to 8 coats of varnish, depending on how much of a glossy, protective sheen you want the object to have.",
