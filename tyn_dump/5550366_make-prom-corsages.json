You could also go with a contrasting color, like using snow white roses to go with a deep red prom dress or cummerbund. Classic neutrals, like white and cream, are an easy option that tend to match almost anything. For example, if the girl\u2019s dress is peach colored, the corsage color scheme could be cream, peach, and green. You could also use the school colors for the corsage or go with colors that match the theme of prom night, if you prefer."
