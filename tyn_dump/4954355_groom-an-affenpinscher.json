To do so, start brushing under your dog\u2019s chest, working upwards to its chin. Next, brush under its belly and down the inside of each leg. Then move up to its spine, brushing vertically down each side and continuing down the outside of each leg. Finally, brush the hair on your dog\u2019s head, including its cheeks, whiskers, beard, and the hair on top of its head. Brush your dog\u2019s coat in layers, starting with the hair on the outermost layer and working your way in, toward the skin. When you\u2019re brushing the hair on your dog\u2019s cheeks, whiskers, and beard, brush forward, moving toward the mouth. Brush the hair on its head forward as well, moving your brush from the back of its head toward the nose. Affenpinschers\u2019 coats don\u2019t need too much maintenance, so brushing it once a week is usually enough."

In general, you\u2019ll want your Affenpinscher\u2019s coat to stay about one inch in length on the shoulders and body. Its coat should be longest between its shoulders and shortest around its rear end. Brushing and combing your dog\u2019s coat will take care of most of the long, unruly hairs, but you\u2019ll need to pluck any remaining ones that did not come out. To do so, separate any long hairs by lifting them up with a comb so that you can grab them with your index finger and thumb. With the other hand, pull the skin around the hair you\u2019re working with taut. Then, with a quick motion, pull the long hair towards you, removing it. If you have trouble grasping the long hairs, try wearing a pair of latex gloves. This will allow you to get a better grip on the hairs. The long hairs you\u2019re pulling out are dead, so plucking them won\u2019t hurt your dog."

Blend its coat as you go, keeping the hair around its shoulders and rib cage longer and the hair around its rear shorter. Use the stripping knife in a raking motion, moving your arm from the shoulder without flexing your wrist. Position the knife at a 45 degree angle to your dog\u2019s coat with the teeth facing in the direction you are raking. Depending how you want your dog\u2019s coat to look, you may only need to do this every six months or so."

Affenpinschers\u2019 coats don\u2019t need too much maintenance, so brushing it once a week is usually enough. Comb through its fur with a \u2018greyhound\u2019 comb. Once you\u2019re finished brushing, go over your Affenpinscher\u2019s coat with a \u2018greyhound\u2019 comb. A greyhound comb has both fine and medium teeth to allow you to groom both the body and face. Comb your dog in the same order you brushed it, starting with its chest and chin, moving next to its belly and the inside of its legs, and then its back and the outside of its legs. Finish by combing the hair on its face. Break apart mats. If you run into any mats while combing your Affenpinscher, stop and break them apart before continuing. To get rid of the mat, break it apart with your fingers as best as you can, gently pulling small pieces of fur out of it, starting from the outsides of the mat. Then use the teeth on your greyhound comb to go through the mat, combing it out piece by piece. Trimming Your Affenpinscher\u2019s Coat Pluck any long, unruly hairs. Most Affenpinscher\u2019s coats need trimmed only every couple months. In general, you\u2019ll want your Affenpinscher\u2019s coat to stay about one inch in length on the shoulders and body. Its coat should be longest between its shoulders and shortest around its rear end.

A stripping knife is a grooming tool that helps to remove any loose hairs and trim your dog\u2019s coat without making any blunt lines. Once you\u2019ve plucked any long hairs from your dog, take your stripping knife and work through its coat, starting at the base of its neck and working your way back to the base of its tail.

Depending how you want your dog\u2019s coat to look, you may only need to do this every six months or so. Trim around its tail. Affenpinschers can have either docked or undocked tails. If your dog has a docked tail, take small trimming shears and trim the hair closely around the tail, moving along with its natural curve. If your dog has an undocked tail, hold the tip of its tail between your fingers and gently pull it over its back, toward its head. Using your scissors, trim the hair on the underside of its tail in the shape of a crescent moon. Trim the hair around its legs. Next, brush the hair on the inside of your dog\u2019s legs toward the middle of its body. Use trimming shears to trim the hair in this area, making it an even length around the entire leg. Your dog\u2019s legs should look rectangular in shape, like small columns. Trim the hair around the anus. Using blunt-nosed scissors, trim the hair around your dog\u2019s anus. Make sure you get any areas that are soiled or starting to mat. Trimming the Hair Around Your Dog\u2019s Face Trim around its eyes. To trim the hair around your dog\u2019s eyes, brush the hair on top of its head forward, toward the nose and over its eyes. Using small trimming shears, make an upside down \u201cU\u201d shape, starting at the outside corner of one eye and moving to the outside corner of the opposite eye. Hold your dog\u2019s head still while you\u2019re trimming by firmly grasping underneath its mouth with your other hand.

Then, using a small pair of scissors, trim the hair so that it is short enough to stay out of your dog\u2019s eyes. Cut the hair on top of its nose. The hair on top of an Affenpinscher\u2019s nose often grows quite long, which can block its eyes. To keep its eyes exposed, cut the hair on top of its nose when you groom your dog.

Most dogs don\u2019t like getting their nails trimmed, so you\u2019ll need to take extra precautions to ensure your dog stays still during the process. To do so, swaddle it in a blanket or towel so it cannot wriggle around while you are trimming its nails. To swaddle your dog, first lay it on its back on top of the blanket. Wrap each side of the blanket up and over your dog\u2019s belly, tucking it securely underneath your dog on the opposite side of its body. Leave only one leg exposed at a time. If your dog is really uncomfortable with you touching its nails, spend time getting it used to having its nails handled before you try to trim them. You can do this by stroking your dog's paws when it's relaxed and giving it lots of treats. Cut the nail in small snips. Using a small nail grinder or nail trimmer, take small snips out of your dog\u2019s nail until you have cut them back to just before the quick, or the small white or pink vein that runs between your dog\u2019s toes. Repeat this on each nail until you\u2019ve trimmed them all. Accidentally cutting the quick can cause quite a bit of bleeding. If you do cut it, apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding.

Using small scissors, cut the hair on the bottom of its feet so that it is even with the pad. Then, trim the hair around the outside of its foot so that your dog\u2019s foot looks round. Bathing Your Affenpinscher Place your dog in a basin or tub. In general, dogs only need bathed once every few months. When you do bathe your dog, place it in a basin, laundry tub, or the bath tub. Make sure whatever you decide to use has a slip-resistant bottom so your dog is not sliding around. If it does not already, you can get a slip-resistant mat to put down. Wet your dog\u2019s coat. Use a hose attachment to wet your dog\u2019s entire coat with warm water. You can also use a bucket to pour water over it if you do not have a hose attachment. Make sure that its entire coat, including the layers closest to the skin are saturated with water. When wetting your dog\u2019s face, place the sprayer close to the skin so you are spraying just the areas you need to wet, not in its eyes, nose, or ears. Apply shampoo. Once your dog\u2019s coat is saturated, apply an all-purpose dog shampoo all over its body. Use your hands to work the shampoo into a lather, making sure to get the underlying layers of the coat. When shampooing its head, be careful you don\u2019t get shampoo in its eyes, ears, or nose. It is a good idea to use a tearless shampoo on your dog\u2019s face, just in case. Rinse your dog. Finally, rinse your dog\u2019s coat using the hose attachment or buckets of water. Work your hands through its coat to help work the shampoo out. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. When rinsing around your dog\u2019s face, hold the sprayer or bucket close to its skin so you can better control where the water is going. Dry your dog\u2019s coat. Once all the shampoo is rinsed out, use a towel to squeeze as much excess moisture from the coat as possible. Then use a hair dryer to finish drying your dog\u2019s coat. Put the hair dryer on a medium heat setting and hold it at least six inches away from the dog at all times. Brush your dog\u2019s hair in the direction it naturally lays while you blow dry it.",
