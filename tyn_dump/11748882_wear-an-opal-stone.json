                    "description": "Opals are known for their vibrant hues and come in all colors of the rainbow, which means an opal can be added to any outfit to either match or compliment whatever colors you want to wear! You can either wear an opal that matches the colors already in your outfit to go for a more streamlined, monochromatic look, or you can wear a contrasting-colored opal to draw attention to the beautiful gemstone. Black opals, which are the most popular type, have a dark body and are usually spotted with fiery reds, cool blues, and greens. White opals have a white or gray body and can look milky in color. They typically have blue, purple, and green undertones. Fire opals, as the name suggests, have a translucent red body and bits of orange and yellow throughout. Blue opals, also known as Peruvian opals, are a creamy blue and can show lighter purples, soft greens, and turquoise when light shines through the body."

If you want to coordinate with your outfit, pick a color from your clothes and match the earrings, or add in some fun contrast by mixing-and-matching colors and patterns. For example, if you\u2019re wearing an emerald green top, bright red opal earrings would provide a great pop of color. Or, you could streamline your look with green-based opals. If you have milky white opals, they can be paired with almost any outfit."

Longer pendants look fantastic with higher necklines as they tend to elongate your body. Try pairing a shorter pendant with a lower neckline to show off your jewelry.Did You Know? Some people believe opals increase creativity and passion and wear them to channel this type of positive energy.
