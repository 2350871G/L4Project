    "text": " Preparing Classic Coconut Cheesecake Bars Preheat the oven and prepare a pan. To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the bars, set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius degrees) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line an 8-inch (20-cm) baking dish with parchment paper and set it aside. You can substitute foil for parchment paper if you prefer. Combine the melted butter and sugar. Add \u00bc cup (57 g) of melted, unsalted butter and \u00bc cup (50 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Whisk the two together until they\u2019re fully combined. Make sure that the butter has cooled before you mix it with the sugar. Mix in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Once the melted butter and sugar are combined, add \u00be cup (96 g) of all-purpose flour, \u00bc teaspoon (2 g) of baking soda, \u00bc teaspoon (1 g) of baking powder, and \u00bc teaspoon of salt. Mix well until a thick dough forms. If you prefer, you can substitute whole wheat flour or a gluten-free flour blend for the all-purpose flour. Press the crust into the bottom of the pan. After you\u2019ve mixed the dough, use clean fingers to press it into the bottom of the lined baking dish. Make sure that the dough is in as even a layer as possible. Whisk the cream cheese and sugar together. To make the filling, add an 8-ounce (226 g) package of cream cheese and \u00bd cup (100 g) of sugar to a large bowl. Whisk the two together until they are fully combined. If you prefer, you can use a stand mixer or handheld mixer to blend the cheesecake filling. Add the flour, egg, and vanilla. Once the cream cheese and sugar are blended together, add 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour, a large egg, and \u00bd teaspoon (2 \u00bd ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Mix well so the ingredients are fully incorporated. For a stronger coconut flavor, you can substitute coconut extract for the vanilla. Fold in the coconut. When the filling base is fully mixed, add 1 \u00bd cups (90 g) of sweetened, shredded coconut to the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the coconut in until it\u2019s fully incorporated. Spread the batter over the crust and bake the bars until the top is golden. After you\u2019ve mixed in the coconut, pour the cheesecake batter over the prepared crust. Spread it evenly, and then bake it in the preheated oven for 33 to 36 minutes, or until the top is golden and the center is set. If you like, you can sprinkle more shredded coconut over the top of the cheesecake bars before you place them in the oven. Cool the pan before slicing into bars. When the cheesecake bars are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Allow the bars to cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting them into slices with a sharp knife. Store any leftover cheesecake bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should keep for 5 to 6 days. Baking Skinny Coconut Cheesecake Bars Preheat the oven and line a pan. To get the oven hot enough to bake the bars, set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Fahrenheit) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, line a 8-inch (20-cm) baking dish with foil and set it aside. When you line the baking dish, make sure that some of the foil overhangs the sides so you can easily lift the bars out when they\u2019re ready. Mix the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. Add \u00be cup (65 g) of crushed graham crackers and 3 tablespoons (42 g) of melted, unsalted butter in a small bowl. Blend the two together until they\u2019re fully combined. Press the graham cracker mixture into the pan and bake it until firm. After you\u2019ve mixed the graham crackers and butter together, use clean fingers to press it into the bottom of the lined baking dish. Next, place the crust in the oven and allow it to bake for 8 to 9 minutes, or until it is set. Leave the oven on when you take the crust out so it will still be preheated when it\u2019s time to bake the filling. Beat the cream cheese. Add 8 ounces (226 g) of reduced fat cream cheese that\u2019s been softened to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric mixer to beat the cream cheese on medium for 1 minute, or until it\u2019s light and fluffy. You can also use a stand mixer to beat the cream cheese. You can beat the cream cheese by hand with a whisk, but it may take a little longer. Add in the yogurt, sugar, egg whites, and flour. After you\u2019ve beaten the cream cheese, add \u00be cup (190 g) of 0% plain Greek yogurt, 2 large egg whites, \u2153 cup (67 g) of sugar, and 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour to the bowl. Beat the mixture on medium until it is fully incorporated. To separate the egg whites from the yolks, break the eggs against a flat surface and separate them into two halves over a bowl. Allow the yolks to fall into the lower half, and move them back and forth between the two halves so the whites drip into the ball below. Continue moving the yolks back and forth until all of the whites are removed. Stir in vanilla and coconut extracts. When the cheesecake filling base is fully mixed, add \u00bd teaspoon (2 \u00bd ml) of vanilla extract and 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of coconut extract to the bowl. Mix the batter on low until the extracts are fully incorporated. You can adjust the amount of coconut extract that you add based on how strong you want the coconut flavor to be in the cheesecake. Pour the filling over the crust and bake the mixture for 20 minutes. Once the cheesecake filling is mixed, spread it over the prepared crust in the baking dish. Place the dish in the preheated oven, and let the bars bake for 20 minutes. Cover the pan with foil and bake for several more minutes. When the bars have baked for 20 minutes, remove the baking dish from the oven and cover it with foil. Place it back in the oven, and let it bake for 5 more minutes. The center should no longer be jiggly when you remove it from the oven. Toast the almonds and coconut in a pan. While the bars are baking, add \u2153 cup (35 g) of sliced almonds and \u2153 cup (20 g) of shredded or flaked unsweetened coconut to a small skillet. Allow the mixture to toast on medium-low heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it is lightly golden. Make sure to stir the almonds and coconut regularly as you\u2019re toasting them. Remove the bars from the oven and let cool briefly. When the bars are finished baking, take them out of the oven. Set the baking dish aside to cool for 5 minutes. Sprinkle the almonds and coconut over the bars and chill before cutting. When the bars have cooled slightly, sprinkled the toasted almond and coconut mixture over the top. Place them in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours. After they\u2019ve chilled for several hours, cut the bars into slices and serve. Make sure that the bars have cooled completely before placing them in the refrigerator to chill. Keep any leftover bars in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for up to a week. Whipping Up Chocolate Coconut Cheesecake Bars Preheat the oven and line a baking dish.

Add 25 chocolate wafer cookies that have been finely crushed, 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar, and \u00bc cup (57 g) of melted butter to a small bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they are fully combined. If you prefer, you can substitute another type of cookie for the chocolate wafers. Graham crackers, chocolate cream sandwich cookies, and vanilla wafers are good options. Press the cookie mixture into the dish.

When the sugar and cream cheese are blended, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract and \u00bd cup (118 ml) of coconut milk to the bowl. Mix the ingredients in on medium-low until they are fully incorporated. Add the eggs one at a time. After the vanilla and coconut milk are blended in, mix 4 eggs into the bowl, one at a time. Blend the eggs in on low speed until they are fully incorporated. If you prefer, you can use egg substitute in place of the eggs. Pour the filling over the cookie crust and bake the bars until the center is set. Once the filling is completely mixed, spread it over the cookie crust. Place the bars in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake for 45 minutes, or until the center is almost set. Cool the bars completely and refrigerate them. When the bars are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Allow them to cool for about 30 minutes, and then chill in the refrigerator for 4 hours until fully set. Cover the baking dish with plastic wrap before placing it in the refrigerator. Heat the chocolate and whipped topping in the microwave. To prepare the bars\u2019 topping, add 2 ounces (57 g) of semi-sweet chocolate that\u2019s been broken into pieces and 1 cup (60 g) of whipped topping to a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the mixture on high for 1 minute or until the chocolate is mostly melted. If you prefer, you can substitute milk or bittersweet chocolate for the semi-sweet. Whisk the mixture and pour it over the bars. After you\u2019ve heated the chocolate and whipped topping, use a whisk to blend the two together completely. Next, pour it over the cheesecake bars in an even layer. Top the bars with the coconut and nuts and cut into pieces. When the topping is on the cheesecake bars, sprinkle 1 cup (60 g) sweetened, flaked coconut and \u00bc cup (26 g) of toasted, sliced almonds over the top. Use a sharp knife to cut the cheesecake into bars and serve. Store any leftover cheesecake bars in the refrigerator. They should keep for 5 to 7 days.",
