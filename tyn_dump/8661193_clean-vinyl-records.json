If you do this, make sure to move the tonearm aside, to prevent any accidental scratches.

Place the brush gently down on top of the record. Start to spin the record slowly, guiding the brush fibers into the grooves. You can also make gentle sweeping motions from the inner to outer rings of the record. It is a good idea to brush your record first, even if you plan to proceed to a wet cleaning method.

Follow the directions of the packaging and aim the gun directly at the record without touching. The gun will then neutralize the static electricity, making your record less likely to attract dust. If your record ever makes a crinkling, crackling, or light crunching noise when being placed in, or pulled out, of its sleeve then it likely needs cleaning by an anti-static device."
