If your backing paper is printed with a grid, you can use it to measure the width of your border, and to guide you in drawing straight lines. Though it\u2019s more difficult than using grid-backed contact paper, you can use a ruler to measure out the width of your border if your backing is blank. Trace along the edge of the ruler as you draw your rectangle to ensure that your lines are straight, and take care to make sure the edges of your rectangle are parallel to the edges of your book."

It should be substantially more than twice the book\u2019s width, and significantly longer than the book. Open your book and place it on the contact paper. The pages should be face-up, as if you were about to read it. Make sure the bottom edge of the book is parallel to the bottom edge of the contact paper. The backing \u2013 or the material that is pulled off to reveal the sticky side \u2013 should be face-up. Draw a border around the open book. Using pencil, outline a large rectangle around the book. Each side of the rectangle should be exactly 4 centimetres (1.6 in) away from each edge of the cover. When you\u2019re done, the rectangle will form a border of contact paper 4 centimetres (1.6 in) wide surrounding the open book. If your backing paper is printed with a grid, you can use it to measure the width of your border, and to guide you in drawing straight lines. Though it\u2019s more difficult than using grid-backed contact paper, you can use a ruler to measure out the width of your border if your backing is blank. Trace along the edge of the ruler as you draw your rectangle to ensure that your lines are straight, and take care to make sure the edges of your rectangle are parallel to the edges of your book. Cut around the measured border. Using scissors or a paper-cutter, cut along the pencil lines you\u2019ve drawn. When you\u2019re finished, you should have a rectangle of contact paper that is 8 centimetres (3.1 in) longer and 8 centimetres (3.1 in) taller than your open book. Fold the contact paper in half. Your fold should be vertical and in the center of the rectangle, exactly where the spine of your book was while you were measuring the paper. Crease the paper firmly. Cut the contact paper so it will fold smoothly over the cover of your book. Open up the folded sheet, then cut a one-inch square out of each corner of the rectangle. Then, cut 1 inch (2.5 cm) long slits at the top and bottom of the vertical fold.

Peel the backing paper off the far right edge of the contact paper. On the side of the fold where you did not place the book, begin to slowly and carefully peel the backing away from the contact paper. Peel straight up and down and to your left, creating a tall, skinny rectangular flap of backing paper separate from the exposed contact paper, approximately 5 centimetres (2.0 in) wide. Fold the flap of backing to the left. This should leave a 5 centimetres (2.0 in) wide strip of exposed contact paper on the far right edge of your rectangle. Take care not to touch it or allow it to accidentally stick it to the backing. Flip your book over to the right, keeping the spine aligned with the fold. The back cover should extend slightly over the crease where the backing paper is peeled away from the contact paper. It should be in contact with the sticky part of the contact paper.
