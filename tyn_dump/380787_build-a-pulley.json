Make sure your cut is directly in the middle of the hanger so you can easily put your spool on. Leave the top of the hanger intact so you can hang it when you use your pulley. If you don\u2019t have a wire hanger, you can make the axle for your pulley by propping a broomstick between 2 tables or counters instead.

Making a Simple Compound Pulley Place 2 cardboard boxes across from one another on a raised surface. Use 2 boxes that are the same size and thickness, such as cereal or packing boxes. Set the boxes on a flat surface, like a table, so they\u2019re about 5\u20136 in (13\u201315 cm) apart. Make sure the edges of the boxes are parallel with one another. Thicker boxes will be able to support more weight while thinner boxes are more likely to rip while you use your pulley. Slide a thread spool onto the middle of a pencil. Use an old wooden spool or one that you bought from a craft store. Slide a pencil through the center of the spool to create an axle that it can rotate freely around. You can also buy pulley wheels from your local hardware store if you don\u2019t have any spools. Poke 2 sets of holes in the boxes so they\u2019re 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) apart. Sharpen a different pencil and slowly poke the point through one of the boxes. Make another hole in the second box that lines up with the first hole you made. Make another set of holes 2\u20133 in (5.1\u20137.6 cm) from the first set. Put both pencils in the holes so they\u2019re perpendicular to the sides of the box. Feed the eraser end of one of the pencils through the hole in one box and the pointed end in the hole across from it. Then put the pencil with the spool in the other set of holes. Make sure the boxes are spaced about 5\u20136 inches (13\u201315 cm) apart and the spool is in the center of the pencil. Make sure the pencils fit tightly in the sides of the boxes. If it doesn\u2019t, use modeling clay inside the boxes to hold it in place. Tie one end of a string to the pencil without the spool. Cut your string so it\u2019s twice as long as the height of your boxes from the floor. Loop the string around your pencil and tie a knot to secure it in place. Drape the loose end of the string over the spool on the other pencil. You can also tie the string around the pencil before you put it in the box. Slide a paperclip onto the string so it\u2019s between the 2 pencils. Feed the other end of your string through the center loop of the paperclip. Keep sliding the paper clip down the string until it\u2019s between the 2 pencils. Let the paper clip rest on the table surface for now. If you don\u2019t want the paperclip to move around, you can tie a knot in the string to secure it in place. Hang a small load on the paper clip. Bend open the paperclip to form a small hook and slide a few small weights on it, such as washers or metal beads. Make sure the weight rests on the table surface and isn\u2019t suspended in the air.
