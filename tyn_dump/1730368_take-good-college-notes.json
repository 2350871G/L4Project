To do this style of note taking, take your notebook paper and draw a line horizontally at the top of your paper, and then draw a line vertically along the margin of the paper or a little wider if you write big. Start by tilting your notes with the title of the lecture. Then write main points on the left side of the vertical line and elaborate more on the right side.
