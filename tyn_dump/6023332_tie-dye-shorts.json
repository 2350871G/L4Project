Check second hand stores and discount clothing stores for a low-cost pair of shorts. If you cannot find white shorts, get the lightest color denim shorts you can find, such as powder blue, cream, or light pink. You can also bleach a pair or dark denim shorts to tie dye. Just pour enough bleach over the shorts to saturate them. Do this while they are in a sink or bathtub, and then rinse the bleach out after they have lightened to the desired color.

Just lay the shorts out on a flat surface and decide where and how you want to tie dye them. For example, you could dye the 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) area around the waistband 1 color, then dye the next 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) section a different color, and so on to the bottom of the shorts."
