Pull the knife from the vent along the belly toward the head, and stop just between the gills. Make sure you're using a sharp knife to make the cut. You should not have to make a sawing motion; the cut should be clean. Take care not to actually cut deep into the vent or belly, since the organs inside may contain bacteria that could contaminate the fish. If your initial cut is too shallow, you can go back and make a deeper cut. If you do cut into the organs, rise the liquid off immediately. Make sure it flows out of the fish, rather than deeper inside."
