Set your mosaic on a piece of plastic or an old shower curtain to catch any wet grout that may fall as you\u2019re spreading it, a trick that will be useful if you would like to reuse any dropped grout as you apply it to the project. Well-spaced tiles, with gaps under a quarter of an inch, then the entire mosaic (estimated to be 18\u201dx 18\u201d) can be covered with 2 pounds of grout. For gaps between mosaic tiles that are greater than an eighth of an inch, you might have to consider grouting it with a grout that contains sand. Sand helps to reinforce the grout and assist it in being resistant to cracking."

        "Use a cotton swab to work the colorant into the tile lines evenly.",
        "If any excess gets on the tile itself, clean it up quickly with a paper towel.",
        "Apply a second coat after applying the first coat.",
        "Adding grout to the entire surface area will be a long job so be prepared to take a while completing it.",
        "After the first layer has been applied, applying a second layer might be necessary (especially when transitioning darker grout to a lighter grout).",
        "Allow two hours for each coat of grout to dry.",
        "Selecting Grout Colour Determine the right colour grout you\u2019d like to use.",
        "Keep in mind that although colour can be provided by grout, it is best to allow the tile to provide the colour in mosaic designs.",
        "Most designers advise you to use grout that acts like a thin gray line in order to make tiles appear distinct without venturing on too boldly.",
        "White grout can appear very harsh as it will draw the eye to the gaps rather than the coloured tiles.",
        "However, it can be a complement to lighter tones so it is very good for showing off pale mosaics.",
        "And when used with strong bright colours, it will produce a Mediterranean feel.",
        "Grey grout enhances most coloured tesserae and has the most unifying effect of all the coloured grouts.",
        "Dark grout unifies darker coloured tesserae and segregates lighter ones.",
        "Opt for a grout colour that blends with the mosaic tile.",
        "It\u2019s impossible to match a grout colour to the exact colour of a tile due to the variations of shading most tiles possess.",
        "Opt for a grout colour that is in the same colour family or blends with the tile.",
        "This is a common selection for people who wish for the focus to be on the entire floor versus the individual tile.",
        "Select a grout colour that contrasts the mosaic tile colours.",
        "Choosing a grout colour that contrasts your tile focuses your eye to see the tile as an individual instead of an entire picture, as you would with blending grout colours.",
        "This is great for people who want a black and white pattern or checkerboard effect on their floors.",
        "For example, gray grout should not be used with a gray tile.",
        "Use a red-brown terra cotta grout for gray tile instead.",
        "Avoid matching colours and gravitate towards contrasting colours.",
        "Pick a grout colour that acts as an accent to the tile.",
        "Accent colours are used by people who want to compliment an accent colour they might be using in their overall design scheme.",
        "If you go with this option, understand that if you ever are to change your design theme later down on the road, you might have to change the grout colour you used initially as well.",
        "Choosing the Right Grout Decide between cement or epoxy based grout.",
        "Cement-based grout is the most commonly used form of grout, and is also the most cost-effective of grouts available for use.",
        "Epoxy is more expensive, more difficult to install, and harder to find, so it might not be worth the effort when making your decision.",
        "But to counter its cons, it has pros of being more durable and having greater resistance to chemical and water damage.",
        "Add sand to your grout.",
        "Adding sand isn\u2019t a crucial component to grout picks, but it is advised for tiles that have spaces in between them greater than 1/8 inch.",
        "It makes grout more resistant to shrinking and cracking which is a must for bigger tile space areas.",
        "Include a sealing grout.",
        "For lighter coloured grout on floors, pick a grout colourant that includes a sealant.",
        "Sealing grout combats the high traffic and moisture kitchen and bathroom areas might receive and protect the grout for much longer.",
        "Stay away from \u201cmembrane-forming\u201d sealers and invest in breathable \u201cpenetrating\u201d sealers instead.",
        "Choose between light shades and dark shades.",
        "Darker grouts can hide stains and dirt more easily than lighter shades, but are more likely to show staining and fading from harsh cleansers.",
        "Lighter grouts tend to show more dirt.",
        "Lean towards shades that are not super light but are not super dark either."
