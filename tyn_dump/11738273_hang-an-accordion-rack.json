Visit a hardware or craft store and get 2 hangers that match the size of your rack. You\u2019ll probably need the smallest size available, but double check to confirm. Make sure the nails with the hangers aren't long enough to poke through the rack. There may be packs that sell multiple hangers. This is useful if you might have to hang more things in your home. 2 hangers should support the weight of most accordion racks. If you plan on hanging anything heavier than bags or coats on yours, then add a third hanger in the middle of the rack for extra support."
