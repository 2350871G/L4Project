        "Put the dried corn into an airtight container if you don\u2019t plan to grind it immediately.",
        "If you plan to make the cornmeal immediately, simply transfer the dehydrated corn to a medium mixing bowl and set it aside.",
        "Otherwise, place the corn into an airtight plastic bag or container.",
        "Resealable plastic bags work well enough if you plan to make cornmeal within a week or two, but for longer storage, use a canning jar or an airtight plastic container.",
        "You can store the dry corn at in dry, dark, room temperature conditions if you plan to use it within a month.",
        "For longer storage, consider keeping it in your refrigerator or freezer.",
        "Grinding the Corn into Cornmeal Grind the dried corn on the coarsest setting.",
        "Adjust the mill plates/stones to the machine\u2019s coarsest setting.",
        "Grind batches of about 2 cups (170 g) of dehydrated corn.",
        "(When making larger quantities of cornmeal, you\u2019ll need to grind multiple batches.)",
        "Place the dried corn into the hopper, then crank the handle to grind it through the machine.",
        "Make sure that you have a bowl or other container beneath the grain mill to collect the processed corn.",
        "The exact method for adjusting the mill plates will vary by machine, so you\u2019ll need to consult the instructions for your grain mill to determine the proper procedure.",
        "Usually, though, you can adjust the coarseness using a knob on the side of the machine.",
        "If you\u2019re grinding the corn with a mortar and pestle, fill the mortar halfway with corn.",
        "Use the pestle to grind the corn into small pieces by crushing the corn kernels on the sides and bottom of the mortar.",
        "When using an electric grain mill or a high-powered electric blender, you\u2019ll need to switch on the power instead of turning a handle.",
        "With blenders, you can adjust the coarseness of the grind by selecting from different grind options on the base.",
        "Sift the coarsely-ground cornmeal.",
        "Dump the coarsely-ground cornmeal into a fine mesh strainer.",
        "Gently agitate the strainer from side to side to separate the finely ground pieces from the coarser chunks.",
        "Ideally, you should use a mesh strainer with gaps measuring between \u204416\u2013\u204432 inch (1.59\u20130.79 mm).",
        "Larger mesh strainers may pass pieces that are too coarse to be classified as meal.",
        "Collect the small pieces that pass through in a separate bowl placed beneath the strainer.",
        "Return the larger pieces caught in the strainer to the hopper of the grain mill.",
        "Grind the corn using a finer setting.",
        "Adjust the mill plates again, setting them to a medium-grade coarseness.",
        "Grind the large pieces of cracked corn through the mill as before.",
        "Once they\u2019ve been ground at this setting, individual corn pieces should be about \u20448 inch (3.2 mm) in size.",
        "It\u2019s important to change the coarseness to a finer setting during this step.",
        "Otherwise, the larger pieces won\u2019t be ground down any further.",
        "Sift the product through the fine strainer a second time.",
        "Transfer the newly ground corn pieces back to the fine mesh strainer.",
        "Rock the strainer from side to side, allowing the finest pieces to pass through into the previous collection bowl for your cornmeal.",
        "You\u2019ll likely collect more cornmeal during this sifting than you collected during the first, but in most cases, you\u2019ll still be left with a notable amount of coarse grain caught in strainer.",
        "Grind the corn a final time on an even finer setting.",
        "Adjust the grain mill once more, setting the machine to medium-fine consistency.",
        "Return the pieces of ground corn that are still in the strainer to the hopper, then grind them through the machine a third time.",
        "As with previous rounds through the grinder, catch all of the \nWhile the machine needs to be set to a finer degree of coarseness, you\u2019ll probably need to avoid using the finest setting.",
        "Even at cornmeal consistency, ground corn can be too coarse to pass through most mills\u2019 finest setting.",
        "Separate the remaining meal from the grits.",
        "Sift the ground corn through the mesh strainer one more time, collecting the fine meal in your original bowl and retaining the coarser grits in the strainer itself.",
        "The grits will be the remnants of dehydrated corn that are too coarse to pass through the fine sifter.",
        "At this point, you should have more cornmeal than leftover grits, and the amount of cornmeal should roughly match the original amount of dried corn you began with.",
        "If you\u2019re still not satisfied with the amount of cornmeal produced, you can pass the coarse grits through your grain mill one more time.",
        "Afterward, sift them again using the mesh strainer.",
        "The amount of cornmeal produced by a fourth pass will likely be less than the amount produced by the previous two passes.",
        "Beyond a fourth pass, additional passes through the grain mill may become even less beneficial.",
        "Using and Storing the Cornmeal Cook with the cornmeal immediately after making it if desired.",
        "Using the cornmeal the same day or the next day will allow you to retain the maximum amount of nutrients and flavor.",
        "Use the cornmeal or the grits that you saved to make grits, cornbread, or Johnny cakes.",
        "You can also use homemade cornmeal in any recipe calling for cornmeal, including cornmeal mush and cornmeal-based fish batter.",
        "Seal the cornmeal in plastic bags if you\u2019ll use it within several months.",
        "This should prevent it from turning rancid.",
        "Place the cornmeal in a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag.",
        "Press out as much air as possible, then seal the bag, leaving only 1 inch (2.5 cm) of open space along the seal.",
        "Suck out the remaining air through a straw inserted into the opening.",
        "Do this step carefully to avoid accidentally inhaling bits of cornmeal.",
        "When finished, quickly remove the straw and seal the remainder of the opening.",
        "Sealed bags of cornmeal can be stored in dark, dry, slightly cool conditions for up to 12 months.",
        "Freeze leftover cornmeal if you\u2019re not going to cook with it for a year.",
        "Cornmeal you don\u2019t plan to use immediately can be transferred into freezer-safe containers and stored in your freezer.",
        "Pack the cornmeal into an appropriate jar or other container, leaving about \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) of empty headspace.",
        "Close the jar and place it into your freezer, storing it there for as long as 24 months.",
        "You can use the cornmeal directly from the freezer without thawing it.",
        "If you\u2019re making a temperature-sensitive recipe, thaw the cornmeal at room temperature for 30-60 minutes before use."
