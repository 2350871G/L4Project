        "Run cold water into the bowl, then add a couple handfuls of ice cubes.",
        "Place the bowl on the countertop next to your stove.",
        "You\u2019ll be using it as an ice bath to quickly cool the boiled beets.",
        "A spacious serving or mixing bowl will work well for this purpose, but you could also fill up the sink itself if you're working with a large quantity of beets or don't have a suitable container handy.",

        "Plunging your freshly-boiled beets into ice water will instantly kill their residual heat and stop them from cooking them any further.",
