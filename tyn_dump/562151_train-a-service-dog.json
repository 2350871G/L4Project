If your dog has been trained in medical alert tasks, be prepared to submit a video of your dog performing them. Ask the organization if they record the test. If not, have the test recorded and keep it available at all times. You might need proof in the future that you and your dog passed. Take the Public Access Test. During the test, you and your dog will be assessed as a team. Use the following checklist to prepare. Make sure your dog can\nPerform the mandatory tasks. Obey basic and advanced commands. Avoid begging for food or eating food that falls on the floor. Avoid being aggressive toward people and other animals. Avoid barking or becoming agitated among loud noises or in crowded spaces. You will be tested on\nUnloading your dog into your vehicle. Entering public spaces. Keeping control of your dog no matter the situation. Retrieving a dropped leash. Calmly handling incidents of possible discrimination. Loading your dog back into your vehicle. Beware of scams! Because the ADA doesn\u2019t require certification, scam artists might try to take advantage of you. If you need guidance, call the ADA information line at 800-514-0301 (voice) or 800-514-0383 (TTY) between 9:30 AM and 5:30 PM (Mon.-Wed., Fri.) or between 12:30 PM and 5:30 PM on Thursday. All times are Eastern Time.There are many registries and websites across the internet that claim to provide unfettered access via ID cards or papers. This is generally frowned upon by trainers and service dog handlers because certifying a service dog and providing papers for them encourages businesses to ask for them. This is not only illegal, but can also provide an easy way for someone to pass off an untrained pet as a trained service animal. Registering a dog as an emotional support animal (ESA) does not grant any public access for the dog, as comfort is not a legally permissible task under the ADA. Registration is not required for ESAs and has no legal standing. All that is required for an ESA is a letter from a healthcare provider that the animal eases symptoms of a disability through comfort.",
