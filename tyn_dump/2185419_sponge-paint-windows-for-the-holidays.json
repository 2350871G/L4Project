Opt for white and blue to create generic winter scenes. Use festive metallic hues like silver and gold to create a sense of festivity commonly associated with the holidays. Consider using tempera paint. Tempera paint dries with a matte finish and the end result is usually translucent. Moreover, it is the easiest paint to remove. Consider using acrylic paint. Acrylic craft paints are among the most commonly used paints for temporary window illustrations. They can be scraped off windows fairly easily but are a little more durable than tempera paints. Add dish soap to your paint before use. This step is especially important if using acrylic paints since dish soap reacts with the paint and makes it easier to wash off later. Add 1 teaspoon of dish soap to every 1/4 cup bowl of paint and mix thoroughly. Avoid permanent window paints. Permanent paints specifically meant for windows will be nearly impossible to clean off once the holidays pass. Painting Basic Holiday Shapes Purchase several soft, non-scratch sponges. Avoid sponges that have a \"scrubber\" side and stick with a soft dish or paint sponges. Cut the sponges into holiday shapes. Trees and stars are fairly simple options, but you can go even simpler by cutting out basic geometric shapes, including circles and triangles, and using the shapes to create more elaborate pictures like ornaments and snowmen. Pour a little of your paint into a small bowl.  Add dish soap, if needed, and stir.  Briefly dip one side of the sponge into the paint. Do not allow the sponge to sit in the paint for a prolonged period, since it may soak up too much and ruin the \"sponge\" texture of the final product. Hold the sponge above the bowl and allow excess paint to drip off. It is important to keep the paint on one side of the sponge to prevent dripping. Press the painted side of the sponge against the window. Apply gentle pressure to prevent the sponge from \"squeezing out\" the paint and causing it to drip down. Continue pressing the painted side of the sponge against the window as often as necessary to create the scene you want to create. When the sponge no longer leaves a painted image, dip it back into the paint and repeat the same process. Painting with Stencils Purchase holiday stencils. You should be able to find stencils online and at craft stores, general stores, and toy stores. Tape the stencil flat against the window using masking tape or painter's tape. The stencil should be held firmly in place. Avoid taping over any previously-painted areas, since the tape may peel away some of the dried paint. Pour a little of your paint into a small bowl.

Dab the sponge over the stencil until the entire design is filled in, but not solid. Do not use the sponge to rub the paint over the stencil, as doing so will ruin the texture of the finished image. Use smaller sponges when filling in pictures that require multiple colors. Carefully dab the paint over the portion of the stencil that requires that color, but do not allow the color to transfer into other portions of the stencil. Use a separate sponge for each paint color instead of trying to rinse the colors off in between uses. Allow the paint to dry before removing your tape and stencils.
