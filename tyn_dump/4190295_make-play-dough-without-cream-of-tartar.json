Your play dough will also turn out the same color as the conditioner, so choose wisely. If you want to make your own color, choose white conditioner. You can use any brand of conditioner.

You can adjust the amount of food coloring or Kool-Aid you use to alter the shade. Be sure to use unsweetened Kool-Aid, otherwise the play dough will turn out too sticky. Mix the flour and salt together in a separate bowl. Pour 1 cup (120 g) of all-purpose flour into a mixing bowl. Add \u00bc cup (75 g) of table salt. Stir them together with a spoon. Use white, all-purpose flour, not whole wheat. Use table salt, not rock salt or sea salt. Add the flour mixture gradually to the hot liquid mixture in the pot.
