Wet a paper towel with warm water and set it on the bottom of a glass jar with a lid. Pour in 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of antiseptic like Lysol into the bottom to prevent mold from forming. Set the butterfly in the jar and seal it for 2-7 days. Smaller butterflies that are only 1\u20133 inches (2.5\u20137.6 cm) long will only take about 2 days to relax, while larger butterflies will take up to 1 week.

Use a spade-tip forceps to slightly spread the butterfly\u2019s wings apart if they aren\u2019t already open. Push the pin through so one-third of its length sticks out from the bottom of your butterfly. Insect mounting pins can be purchased online or in specialty science and lab equipment stores. Insect pins come in many different sizes, but you only need #2 or #3 pins with a diameter of about \u204450 in (0.51 mm)."
