The fish should have a fresh saltwater smell that isn't too \"fishy.\" If the smell makes you wrinkle your nose, the fish aren't fresh. Make sure the fish you buy are boneless.

If you wish to serve filets instead, skip to the next step. Batter the Fish Make the spice mixture. Mix the salt, pepper and sugar in a small bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to combine the ingredients thoroughly.For extra flavoring, consider adding red chili powder, garlic powder or other spices you like. Sprinkle the fish with half of the spice mixture. Spread the fish pieces evenly across the cutting board. Use your fingers to sprinkle them with half of the salt, sugar and pepper mixture. Turn the fish over and sprinkle some on the other side to make sure each piece is evenly coated. Toss the fish pieces in flour. Place the fish pieces in a large bowl and sprinkle the flour over them. Use tongs to toss the fish to make sure they each get a thin coating of flour. Fry the Fish Heat the oil. Pour the oil into a shallow frying pan or cast iron skillet.

Use your fingers to sprinkle them evenly with the remaining half of the spice mix. Garnish the dish. Place the fresh scallion, jalapenos, and any other garnishes you prepared around the fish pieces in the serving bowl.
