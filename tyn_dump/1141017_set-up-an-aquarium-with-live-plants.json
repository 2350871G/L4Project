The sand will filter water, provide nutrients to plants, and create a place for bottom feeding animals to dig and bury themselves. Avoid using gravel, as it contains no nutrients needed for live plants. Gravel is a common choice for aquariums that don't have live plants as it is easy to clean and easy to handle. However, for live plants, gravel provides no nutrition and colored gravel can actually make the water more acidic. If you must use gravel, opt for fine gravel over chunks of gravel, as you can mix it with sand or another substrate to provide some level of nutrition. This is not advised if you plan on having more than a few plants in the aquarium."

Different types of plants require different depths to be planted in the substrate \u2014 some common methods for different plant types include:\nMosses and Grasses: Turn off the filter, and place the moss directly on top of the substrate in areas you want it to grow. Place a heavy coin, such as a half dollar or pound coin, on top of the moss to keep it down while the roots grow into the substrate over the next week. Potted plants: Remove the plant from the plot and be careful to not damage the roots poking out of the bottom of the dirt or cotton. Dig a hole in the substrate as wide as the plant, place it inside, and then blend in the sides of the plant with substrate. Ferns: Attach the fern to a rock or piece of driftwood with a fishing wire or cotton thread to keep it upright. Ferns do not need to be placed in the substrate layer, most just need something solid to hold onto for stability. Cotton thread will dissolve with time, whereas fishing wire should be cut away and removed once the fern takes hold. Plants with a stem: Push the base of the stem about 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) into the substrate and it should stay upright. If not, use a fishing wire or cotton thread to keep it up until it can support itself.

The tank needs time to build up nutrients and beneficial bacteria in the substrate. This beneficial bacteria helps to stabilize the tank and prevents ammonia and nitrate build up. Especially with bottom feeding and burrowing aquatic animals, it is important to let your plants get to the point that they can support themselves before you introduce new creatures. Some aquatic pets will dig at the base of plants, or eat leaves and stems, so you give your plant the best chance of survival if you allow it to take root."

Look up what conditions are optimal for your fish or aquatic animal, and buy a heater that will keep it maintained at that temperature. Laying Substrate in the Tank Clean and lay sand 3 cm (1.2 in) thick on the tank's bottom. Run the sand under water in a pillowcase or ultra-fine mesh container until the water comes out clean.

        "Look for plants that fit inside the aquarium without coming out of the water.",
        "Depending on the size of your aquarium, you will have either a lot of options to choose from or a limited selection.",
        "Tall plants are not suitable for short aquariums because the part of the plant outside the water will not survive, whereas tiny plants may become lost in the scenery in a large aquarium.",
        "Moss and grasses are great in almost any aquarium, so be sure to include these in your tank.",
        "If your cage is longer than it is wide, consider planting some frilly and wide ferns as opposed to stemmed plants that continually grow.",
        "Vary the size and location of plants to improve the scenery's aesthetic.",
        "Some plants are better to put in specific areas in the tank for the aesthetic and scenic purposes.",
        "For example, short plants should be located at the front, while tall plants should be at the back so as not to disrupt the view.",
        "Common groupings of aquatic plants include carpeting plants, foreground plants, mid-ground plants, and background plants.",
        "Carpeting plants: Carpeting plants will spread across the substrate layer and create a lush \"carpet\" of vegetation.",
        "Java moss, hair grass, and other mosses and grasses are easy to plant and take care of.",
        "Foreground plants: Foreground plants are placed in the front of the aquarium, and add a sense of depth and scenery to the tank.",
        "Water Wisteria, Pygmy Swords, and other short but frilly plants are great options.",
        "Mid-ground plants: Mid-ground plants are thick, tall, and fill out the natural scenery in the tank.",
        "Mid-ground plants include African Water Ferns, Java Ferns, and other plants that take up lots of space and spread out.",
        "Background plants: Background plants are placed at the back of the cage and are often the tallest and most obstructive vegetation.",
        "Amazon Swords, Anubias, and other towering and flowering plants are popular choices.",
        "Planting and Taking Care of Live Plants Remove your plant from its container and set it in the substrate layer.",
        "Take care not to damage the plant as you remove it from its packaging, and carefully plant it in the substrate according to the planting instructions.",
        "Different types of plants require different depths to be planted in the substrate \u2014 some common methods for different plant types include:\nMosses and Grasses: Turn off the filter, and place the moss directly on top of the substrate in areas you want it to grow.",
        "Place a heavy coin, such as a half dollar or pound coin, on top of the moss to keep it down while the roots grow into the substrate over the next week.",
        "Potted plants: Remove the plant from the plot and be careful to not damage the roots poking out of the bottom of the dirt or cotton.",
        "Dig a hole in the substrate as wide as the plant, place it inside, and then blend in the sides of the plant with substrate.",
        "Ferns: Attach the fern to a rock or piece of driftwood with a fishing wire or cotton thread to keep it upright.",
        "Ferns do not need to be placed in the substrate layer, most just need something solid to hold onto for stability.",
        "Cotton thread will dissolve with time, whereas fishing wire should be cut away and removed once the fern takes hold.",
        "Plants with a stem: Push the base of the stem about 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) into the substrate and it should stay upright.",
        "If not, use a fishing wire or cotton thread to keep it up until it can support itself.",
        "You can plant stemmy plants all in one area in a frilly bunch, or spread them around the back and middle areas.",
        "Trim your plants regularly to encourage their growth and survival.",
        "Plants of all kinds can quickly become too big and take up too many resources in the tank for their own good.",
        "Use a very sharp knife to cut away dead leaves, dead stems, and trim the grass or moss in the tank every time you clean the aquarium.",
        "Moss can be re-planted in other areas of the tank, if you wish, by simply placing it onto an empty patch of substrate and weighing it down with a heavy coin until the roots take hold.",
        "Take about 2 in (5.1 cm) off of the top of a stemmed plant to encourage its growth when it gets to reach the top of the water level.",
        "Let the tank cycle water for about 1 month before you introduce your fish.",
        "Substrate, plants, and everything else you've put into the aquarium can change the acidity, nutrient content, and overall healthiness of the tank.",
        "Allow the tank to cycle water normally through the filter, remove algae and buildup, and allow the plants to take root before you introduce fish and aquatic animals.",
        "The tank needs time to build up nutrients and beneficial bacteria in the substrate.",
        "This beneficial bacteria helps to stabilize the tank and prevents ammonia and nitrate build up.",
        "Especially with bottom feeding and burrowing aquatic animals, it is important to let your plants get to the point that they can support themselves before you introduce new creatures.",
        "Some aquatic pets will dig at the base of plants, or eat leaves and stems, so you give your plant the best chance of survival if you allow it to take root."
