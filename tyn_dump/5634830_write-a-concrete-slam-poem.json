Think of a topic you care about, and know well enough to write about; also think about a wide enough and deep enough topic that you have something meaningful to say about it. You can write a poem about baseball if you really want to, but try to come up with something relevant to say about the topic. The best poems, and the poems best-liked by audiences, are ones they can relation to, and that seem applicable to their lives."

If you find you tend to be influenced by lyrics you hear when writing, or if you just don't like writing while music is playing, listen to some beforehand. Or if you don't like music at all, try looking up artwork or cool photography online for something to inspire you."

Read your poem out loud to your self, trying to approximate the speed you will read it at the slam. Don't just read it in your head - you think a lot faster than you speak, and you'll be shocked when a page or two of writing only lasts you forty or fifty seconds."
