How long you leave the shorts in the sun or bleach solution depends on how dark the original color was, and how light you want them to become. This can take anywhere between a few hours to over 24 hours. Consider checking on the shorts every few hours. Bleach is caustic, and it can eat away at the fabric of your shorts. To prevent over-bleaching or ruining your shorts, plan on checking on them every four hours, if possible. The longer you leave your shorts in the bleach solution, the weaker the fibers will become."

Move the tub to a well-ventilated area. Bleach gives off a strong odor and could make you feel light-headed. The best place to work would be outside, but if this is not possible, make sure that you have at least a window open. Keeping a fan on in the room will give you even more ventilation. Put on the rubber gloves. Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you will still want to protect your skin. Bleach is caustic, and can irritate or burn your skin. Fill the tub with bleach and water. You will need one part liquid bleach and three to four parts water. How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts. You want the water-bleach solution to be deep enough so that the shorts end up completely submerged once you put them in the tub. Put the shorts in the bleach solution. Make sure that they are completely submerged. If they keep floating to the top, you can pin them down with a heavy object, such as a glass vase or a couple of rocks. Let the shorts bleach. You can do this by taking the shorts out of the bleach solution and leaving them out in the sun on a bleach resistant surface, or you can simply leave them in the solution for several hours. How long you leave the shorts in the sun or bleach solution depends on how dark the original color was, and how light you want them to become. This can take anywhere between a few hours to over 24 hours. Consider checking on the shorts every few hours. Bleach is caustic, and it can eat away at the fabric of your shorts. To prevent over-bleaching or ruining your shorts, plan on checking on them every four hours, if possible. The longer you leave your shorts in the bleach solution, the weaker the fibers will become. Pull the shorts out of the bleach solution. Once the shorts have achieved the lightness you desire, pull them out of the bleach solution and squeeze them to get rid of the extra moisture. If you have left them out in the sun, simply take them out of the sun. Wash the shorts with soap and cool water. Gently work some soap into the shorts, and rinse them with cool water until you cannot smell the bleach anymore. The soap will help prevent the bleach from yellowing the fabric. Dry the shorts. You can do this by setting them out in the sun, or tossing them into the dryer for a few minutes. Making Bleached Ombre and Dip-Dyed Shorts Gather your supplies. For this project, you will need a pair of shorts, rubber gloves, some water, bleach, and a bit of soap. You will also need a plastic bucket or tub that is large enough to comfortably fit the shorts. If you do not have any shorts, you can make your own by cutting the legs off of a pair of pants. For a more dramatic ombre effect, consider using darker denim. A pants hanger is not necessary, but it could help weigh the shorts down as you are dipping them into the bleach. Decide how high you want the ombre to go. Make a mark on the fabric using a washable fabric marking pen. Place the tub in a well-ventilated area. The best place to work would be outside, but if this is not possible, you can work indoors with a window open. Having a fan on in the room would also aid ventilation. Put on the rubber gloves. Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you still want to protect your hands. Bleach is caustic and can burn your skin if you are not careful. Fill the tub with bleach and water. You will need one part liquid bleach and one part water. How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts. Put the shorts into the bleach solution. Dip the shorts 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) below the mark you have made. The bleach will eventually creep up the shorts the rest of the way and reach the mark. Consider folding the shorts in half and clipping them onto a pants hanger. This will allow you to pull them out of the bleach solution more easily. The weight of the hanger will also prevent the shorts from falling into the bleach solution. Leave the shorts in the solution for ten minutes. You should start to see some fading during this time. If you are working with a darker-colored pair of shorts, then you may leave them in the bleach solution for a few more minutes. Take the shorts out of the bleach solution and rinse them. After about ten minutes, take the shorts out of the water and rinse them using fresh, cool water. This will make the fading smoother. If you wish to make dip-dyed shorts, do not take them out of the bleach solution. Simply leave them in the bleach solution until you have achieved the lightness you want. Dip-dyed shorts have a more defined line than ombre shorts. Return the shorts to the bleach solution. For a more dramatic ombre effect, put the shorts back into the bleach solution, but only partway. Do not dip them as deeply as you did the first time. This way, you are lightening the bottom portion of the shorts even more, thus creating the ombre effect. Pull the shorts out of the bleach solution and rinse them. Squeeze the shorts to get the extra moisture out, and rinse them using soap and cool water until you cannot smell the bleach anymore. The soap will help prevent the bleach from making yellow stains. Dry the shorts. You can do this by leaving them out in the sun, or by tossing them into the dryer. Making Reverse Tie Dye Shorts Gather your supplies. For this project, you will need a pair of shorts, rubber gloves, water, bleach, some soap, and rubber bands. You will also need a plastic bucket or tub large enough to comfortably fit the shorts. If you do not own a pair of denim shorts, you can make your own by cutting the legs off of a pair of jeans. Move the plastic tub to a well-ventilated area. Outside is the best location because there is plenty of fresh air and you are less likely to feel light-headed. If it is not possible to work outside, then make sure that you have a window open; turning a fan on in your work space will give you additional ventilation. Put on the rubber gloves. Although you will be working with diluted bleach, you still want to protect your skin. Bleach can irritate or burn your skin. Fill the tub with bleach and water. You will need one part liquid bleach and one part cool water. How much bleach and water you use will depend on the size of your tub and the shorts. You want the water-bleach solution to be deep enough so that the shorts end up completely submerged. Tie rubber bands around your shorts. Take a few rubber bands and start tying off small parts of your shorts. You can tie the bands randomly around your shorts in little nibs for a starburst effect. You can also scrunch the shorts into a rope, and wrap rubber bands around the \"rope\" in 3 to 4 inch (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) intervals. Put the shorts in the tub. Press down on them so that they are completely submerged in the bleach and water solution. If they keep floating to the top, you can weigh them down by putting a heavy object, such as a glass vase or a few rocks, on top of them. Leave the shorts in the tub until they have achieved the desired lightness. The longer you leave them in the bleach and water solution, the lighter they will become. In general, you will start seeing some results after about 20 minutes. Do not leave the shorts in the bleach solution for too long, however, or you will risk damaging the fabric. Take the shorts out of the tub. Once the shorts have reached the level of lightness you want, pull them out of the tub. Squeeze them to get the excess moisture out. Cut the rubber bands off. Using a pair of scissors, snip the rubber bands off. Be careful not to cut the fabric of the shorts. Rinse the shorts using soap and cool water. Gently work some soap into the shorts and rinse them using cool water until you can no longer smell the bleach. The soap will help prevent the bleach from staining the fabric yellow. Dry the shorts. You can either hang them to dry in the sun, or you can toss them into the dryer for a few minutes. Dyeing Bleached Shorts Start with a pair of bleached shorts. You can use completely bleached shorts, ombre bleached shorts, or even tie die bleached shorts. If you wish to learn how to bleach your shorts, refer to one of the sections in this article on bleaching your yours, ombre bleaching your shorts, or reverse tie dying your shorts. Fill a large, plastic bucket with hot water. You will be dyeing your shorts in this, so make sure that you do not mind if it gets stained. You need 3 gallons (11.35 liters) of very hot water. Add the fabric dye. You can use liquid fabric dye or powder fabric dye. If you are using liquid dye, shake the bottle, and pour \u00bd of the liquid dye into the hot water. If you are using powdered fabric dye, empty the packet into 2 cups (473.18 milliliters) of very hot water, then add the water to the bucket. Stir the dye with a long stick or spoon (that you will not be using for cooking purposes again) to mix everything. Add some salt. Measure out 1 cup (280 grams) of salt and add it to 2 cups (473.18 milliliters) of very hot water. Mix with a spoon until everything is combined, and then pour the salt water into the dye bath. Stir again until everything is mixed together. The salt will help the dye stick to the jean fabric better. Test the dye color. You can do this by dipping a piece of white, cotton fabric into the dye bath and then taking it out. If the color is too dark, add more hot water. If the color is too light, add more dye. Once you have achieved the color you want, you are ready to dye your shorts. Keep in mind that the dyed item will be a little darker when it is wet than when it is dry. Fabric dye is translucent, so the original color of the shorts will affect the new color. For example, if you choose to dye a pair of ombre shorts pink, the white part will end up pink, but the blue denim part will end up purple. Consider dyeing the shorts completely. Dip the shorts in warm water, then squeeze them to get the extra moisture out. Soak them in the dye bath for 10 to 30 minutes until you get the shade you want. Make sure to stir the shorts in the dye bath from time to time, or you may get splotches. Consider tie dyeing the shorts. Tie rubber bands around the shorts. You can tie the rubber bands in little nibs randomly for a starburst effect. You can also scrunch the shorts into a rope, and tie rubber bands around the \"rope\" at 3 to 4 inch (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) intervals. Once you are done tying the shorts, soak them in warm water, then squeeze them to get the extra moisture out. Dunk them into the dye bath for 10 to 30 minutes, or until you have achieved the color you want. Consider ombre dying your shorts. Dip the bottom part of your shorts into the dye bath and rest them against the wall of the bucket so that they don't slide down into the water. Leave them in the dye for 10 minutes. After about 10 minutes, dip the shorts further into the dye bath, and lean them against the side of the bucket. Leave the shorts in the dye for 5 minutes. Swish the shorts around to get an even coating of dye, then dip them the rest of the way into the dye bath (or as far as you want the ombre effect to go). Quickly pull the shorts out. Pull the shorts out of the dye bath. Once you have finished dyeing your shorts using your chosen method, pull them out of the dye bath and gently squeeze them to get the extra moisture out. If you have chosen to tie dye your shorts, snip the rubber bands off using a pair of scissors. Be careful so as not to cut the actual fabric of the shorts. Rinse the shorts using warm water. Keep rinsing your shorts until the water runs clear. If you have chosen to ombre dye your shorts, hold them by the lightest part and rinse them using cool water first; squeeze the extra moisture out and then rinse them out using warm water until the water runs clear. Dry your shorts. You can do this by leaving them out in the sun, or by tossing them into the dryer for a few minutes. Embellishing Your Bleached Shorts Consider embellishing your shorts further. You can leave them as they are, or you can use paint, bleaching pens, or studs to add a personal touch. Add some designs using fabric paint or fabric markers. After your shorts have dried, you can add some designs using fabric paint and stencils, or fabric markers. Place a sheet of cardboard inside your shorts, so that the paint or marker doesn't bleed through. After this, you can place some adhesive fabric stencils onto your shorts, and fill the spaces in using a paintbrush and fabric paint. You can also draw designs free-handedly using fabric markers. Wait until the paint has dried before taking the cardboard out. Draw designs using bleach. You can do this with a bleach pen, or by dipping a paintbrush into some undiluted bleach. Simply place a piece of cardboard inside your shorts, and draw some interesting designs onto your shorts. Wait until the designs become as light as you want them to be, then take the cardboard out. Rinse the shorts using soap and cool water, and hang them up to dry. You can also use this technique to draw designs on unbleached shorts instead. Add some studs. The best places to add studs is around the waistband and along the outer edges of the pockets. You can poke them directly into the fabric, and then flatten the prongs using a butter knife, or you can glue them onto the shorts using fabric glue. Fray the bottom of the shorts. You can do this by simply cutting the bottom hem off. You can leave the shorts as they are, or you can use a sewing machine and sew along the bottom hem so that they do not fray too much. If you choose to sew, sew \u00bd inch (1.27 centimeters) up the bottom of the cut hem. Distress the shorts. You can create a unique look by distressing your shorts. You can do this by creating a few slices in the lap part using a craft knife and then pulling out the short strands with a pair of tweezers. You can also buff the lap area using a piece of coarse-grained sandpaper or a cheese grinder.",
