        "Separating the cupcake into proportioned pieces is a favorite tactic of dieters since it allows you to eat a portion of a cupcake while saving the rest for later.",
        "Hold the cupcake steady with one hand.",
        "Carefully grasp the cake portion of the cupcake near the top, using your non-dominant hand.",
        "Hold it carefully to minimize the amount of frosting you get on your hand.",
        "Use a knife to cut the cupcake into pieces.",
        "Smoothly divide the cupcake in half, dividing it into to equal sides, using a plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife.",
        "If desired, you can divide the cupcake further into bite-size pieces.",
        "Note that you are cutting the cupcake vertically, not horizontally.",
        "The top and bottom should still be intact, unlike with other methods mentioned.",
        "Eat one piece at a time.",
        "If you cut the cupcake into bite-size pieces, pop each piece into your mouth one at a time.",
        "If you only cut the cupcake in half, pick up each half and take bites out of it.",
        "Taking One Bite at a Time (Standard Method) Hold the cupcake between your thumb and forefinger.",
        "Grasp the cupcake with your dominant hand, gripping the sides lightly but securely between your thumb and forefinger.",
        "This is the classic cupcake-eating method.",
        "It can be fairly messy, but it maintains the look of the cupcake for as long as possible and works with filled and non-filled cupcakes alike.",
        "Take bites directly out of the cupcake.",
        "Bring the cupcake up to your mouth and take bites out of it directly.",
        "Wipe away any frosting that gets on your nose, lips, or cheeks as you eat.",
        "Eating Mashed Place the cupcake in a small bowl.",
        "This is a messy method meant for messy cupcakes, so a bowl is preferable to a plate.",
        "This method is rarely used when eating a cupcake in good condition.",
        "Instead, this method works best for cupcakes that are otherwise inedible because they are too crumbly or because the frosting is too runny.",
        "Use a fork to mash the cupcake.",
        "Press down onto the cupcake using the tines (the pointy part) of the fork, smashing the cake down until it is completely broken apart.",
        "Mix the pieces together.",
        "Stir the crumbled cake pieces and the frosting until clumps of sticky cupcake goodness form.",
        "You will need a sufficient amount of frosting to make this work.",
        "If your cupcake is lacking in frosting and you cannot get it to clump up, consider adding more frosting or a dollop of jam or similarly sticky spread to the crumbled up cupcake.",
        "Eat with the fork.",
        "Pick up the clumps of cupcake with your fork and eat them that way.",
        "If the clumps fall apart when you stick your fork through them, switch to a spoon.",
        "Finished."
