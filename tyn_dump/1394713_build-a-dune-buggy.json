        "Take plenty of time inspecting the car, making sure the jacks are well-positioned and stable.",
        "Detach the battery and other electrical wires by hand.",
        "Start with the car\u2019s engine compartment, which is in the back on a classic Beetle.",
        "The battery is underneath the back seat and held down by a bracket you can turn counterclockwise with a socket wrench.",
        "Do the same thing with the nuts on the battery terminals to remove the red and black wires connected to them.",
        "Also, squeeze the plastic connectors on any additional wires you are able to reach nearby in order to detach them..\nEvery electrical component needs to be detached.",
        "That includes the brake lights, the oil pressure switch, and the motor.",
        "Some of them are hard to spot at first, but you will get another chance at them as you remove each component.",

        "Remove the bolts holding the body panels to the chassis.",
        "Crawl under the car with a box-end wrench in hand.",
        "A classic Beetle has about 22 bolts with 17 mm (0.67 in) and 13 mm (0.51 in) heads around its edges.",
        "Twist these counterclockwise with wrenches of the same size until you are able to pull them off.",
        "There are also bolts on the axles near the wheel, so make sure you get those as well if they are there.",
        "Sometimes bolts are missing in older cars.",
        "If someone removed them without replacing them, that makes your job a little easier.",
        "Be sure to get new bolts if you need them when you begin putting the dune buggy back together.",
        "Unscrew the fuel tank and any other bolts under the hood.",
        "Check back inside the car for any bolts holding the components in place.",
        "There are usually 4 of them around the fuel tank in the front end, but you may find other ones to take care of.",
        "Use your box-end wrench again to remove them.",
        "If you\u2019re able to move the fuel tank, you\u2019re on the right track.",
        "Moving the fuel tank will help you access some of the wires, including the steering column and brake lights.",
        "Detach the fuel and brake fluid lines with pliers.",
        "This part gets a little messy, so have some clean storage containers available.",
        "Find the fuel line first as it runs from the fuel tank to the chassis.",
        "Using a pair of locking pliers, pull the hose free and catch the draining fuel in a container.",

        "Set them all aside, since most of them can be reused in your buggy.",
        "Leave the frame in place for now.",
        "It\u2019s usually too heavy to move right away, although you could try taking off the doors and hoods by unscrewing them with a Phillips-head screwdriver.",
        "If you plan on reusing the wires and hoses still in the car, consider labeling them so you know what parts they attach to.",
        "Lift the top part of the frame off of the chassis.",
        "Once you have all the internal parts out, detach any remaining body panels.",
        "The frame is like the car\u2019s metal skeleton that all the parts attach to, while the chassis is the base part that rests over the wheels.",
        "The framework is too heavy for a single person to lift, so gather 4 of your strongest friends.",
        "Have everyone lift the frame up, and if you have an extra set of hands, have them push the chassis out from under it.",
        "Try to remove the body panels by using a socket wrench on the bolts connecting them to the frame.",
        "Many times, you can save both the frame and chassis to form the base structure of the buggy.",
        "If the panels won\u2019t come off, lift the frame off the chassis.",
        "If the chassis is intact, you can easily reinstall the engine and other components needed to cruise around in your new buggy.",
        "Sell the leftover parts if you\u2019re looking for a little extra spending money.",

        "Some parts may be stuck.",
        "Soak them in a penetrating oil like WD-40 to loosen them for removal.",

        "Freestyle customizing is possible if you know how to build cars.",
        "Place the engine on the back part of the frame behind the seats.",
        "The VW Beetle 4-cylinder, air-cooled engine works well in a dune buggy.",
        "It is relatively light, inexpensive, and easy to maintain.",
        "Secure it to the frame using a box-end wrench and some bolts, then begin twisting the air hoses onto the ventilation spouts with the wrench.",
        "Air-cooled engines are much easier to set up than water-cooled engines.",
        "You don\u2019t need to worry about cooling fluid or much of anything else that complicates things.",
        "The engine stays cool by taking in air as you drive.",
        "Install a new battery in the car.",
        "Find some space in the battery bracket near the engine.",
        "Generally, a dune buggy does well with a 12 or 24-volt battery.",
        "Use the old battery in the vehicle for comparison if you still have it.",
        "Once you have the new battery, cover it with the battery bracket and hold them together using 4 mm (0.16 in) hex bolts and Phillips screws as needed.",
        "The battery powers the buggy's starter along with any other electrical parts.",
        "Dune buggies don\u2019t require the strongest batteries, but if you have a choice, get a larger battery to ensure your vehicle has enough power.",
        "Install shocks so the buggy doesn\u2019t bounce as much on the road.",
        "A good suspension system gives you that smooth, relaxing ride even when you\u2019re driving over some bumpy hills.",
        "The old shocks are the coiled spring-like pieces underneath your buggy.",
        "Use a socket wrench set and penetrating oil to remove them.",
        "Replace them with similar shock absorbers to keep your buggy stable as it moves.",
        "A good suspension system keeps a buggy stable and off the pavement.",

        "Keep your car jacked up and start removing the lug nuts with an appropriately-sized socket wrench.",
        "Hang onto the lug nuts unless they\u2019re in bad condition.",
        "Then, get some VW Beetle tires as replacements.",
        "Look for tires that are the same size and use the same number of lug nuts as the old ones.",
        "If your tires are really worn out, you could remove the entire wheel and either clean it or replace it.",
        "Fit a new fiberglass body to fit over the buggy\u2019s frame.",
        "The easiest way to do this is by purchasing a pre-made fiberglass frame.",
        "The underside of the body attaches to the chassis through metal bolts.",
        "That allows you to snap the fiberglass panels together and then add any extra bolts needed to secure them.",
        "Pre-made frames and kits come with all the bolts you need.",
        "This is handy since the bolt size you need to use could vary depending on the manufacturer.",
        "Once you finish installing the body, you can give your buggy a fresh coat of paint before taking it out for a drive."
