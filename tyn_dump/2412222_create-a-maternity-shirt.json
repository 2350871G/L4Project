    "text": " Cutting the Shirt Go to a thrift store and buy a large cotton t-shirt. It can be a long sleeved or short sleeved shirt. Try to find an extra large to 2 extra large size, so that there is room for your belly. A very small woman may be able to use a large size rather than an extra large. However, most people will want an extra large or slightly bigger. Measure your bust line for an empire waist. Try on the shirt, pull it down and look in the mirror. Mark the line that goes comfortably under your bust with a pin. Remove the shirt carefully. Smooth the shirt and place it on a craft table, above a self-healing mat. Measure the bust line with a plastic ruler and mark your line 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) below the pin line to allow for hemming later in the process. Use a rotary cutter to cut a straight line across the width of the shirt under the line. Place the rotary cutter next to the hard plastic ruler to ensure you get a straight line. Fashioning the Sleeves Go into your closet and find a tank top that you like. This top should be fitted. You will use this as a template for the sleeves. Place the tank top over the top of the t-shirt top on your self-healing mat. Try to match up the necklines and the arm holes to the best of your ability. Although these shirts are in different sizes, you can see approximately how they will fit on your body. Mark the outline of the tank top sleeve holes on your large t-shirt. Use a fabric pen to draw the arcs. Remove the tank top from your mat. Cut along your pen lines with a rotary cutter or fabric scissors. A rotary cutter can make a more even arc with a practiced hand. Turn your cropped t-shirt inside out.  Fold in the edges of the arm holes slightly. You can either pin it or eye it and use an iron to fold the hem in slightly. Match your sewing machine thread to your t-shirt color. Sew the armhole hems with a 1/8 to 1/4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) seam allowance. Create darts to take out a gap in the top of the shirt. Try on the t-shirt when it is inside out. Look to see if there are any gaps between the bust and the armpit. Pinch the excess fabric. There will be more fabric nearer to the armpit than towards the bust. Pin this excess fabric to create your dart on 1 side. Repeat this process on the other side of the shirt. Pin the dart. Look into the mirror to ensure the darts look even. Take off the top of the shirt. Sew along the pinched line to create a dart. You will need to place your shirt on the sewing machine inside out and sew with a straight stitch along the inside edge of the pinched fabric. Repeat on the opposite side to create the second dart.  Sewing the Waist Fold up a 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) hem from the top portion of your shirt. Use an iron to ensure it stays while you gather the rest of your shirt. Take the bottom of the shirt that you cut off earlier. Turn it inside out to match the top of the shirt. Pinch the shirt to gather it. You will want to pinch it vertically and gather it every 1/2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm), depending upon how large your shirt is and how big you want the gathering to be. Pin your gathered fabric to the hem of the top of the shirt. Continue gathering and pinning all the way around the empire waist of the shirt. Turn the top portion of your shirt down into the bottom or the shirt. This will expose just the hem so that you can sew it more easily. Sew around the shirt, at the gathering and top hem, with a straight stitch.  Making a Sash Take some leftover fabric and make a sash. If you cut off long sleeves, you can sew them together at the unfinished ends to make your sash. Take a piece of material, matching or complimentary, and cut 2 pieces that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and 40 inches (102 cm) long.  Place the outside (right) sides facing each other. Sew around the edges, leaving a 2 inch (5 cm) space for turning on a side. Iron the sash and sew around the perimeter with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.  Try on your shirt right side out. Wrap the sash just under your bust, around your empire waist. Pinch the 2 sides of the sash together, instead of knotting the ends. Offset the point at which they meet to the right or left side of your belly, so that your sash will hang to the side of your stomach. Pin the sashes together. Then, mark the point where you want them to meet with a fabric pen. Take off the sash and the shirt. Sew through both layers of the sash, where it is pinned.  Loop the sash around the empire waist of the shirt. Pin the sash in place according to the line you marked. Sew the sash to the shirt. You can sew it at the top, where the top of your shirt starts and leave the bottom open, to ensure you have some flexibility as your belly grows larger.",
