        "You can use a tarp of any size to collect rainwater, but a larger the surface area, the more water you\u2019ll harvest.",

        "Cut a hole through the lowest corner of the collection tarp, just large enough to fit the opening of your pipe through, then seal it over with waterproof sealant.",
        "Run the pipe down the slope to your collection tank.",
        "Use corner pipe attachments if you need to lift the water into the tank; the pressure should be high enough to pump it upwards on its own.",

        "Use PVC drainpipe, which you can buy at a home improvement store.",
        "You can lay it flat on the ground, or dig a slight depression around it to keep it in place.",
        "Collect the water in a tarp-covered hole for a cheaper option.",
        "If you don\u2019t want to buy a large storage tank, simply dig a deep hole, at least 5\u20136 ft (150\u2013180 cm), into the ground and cover with with a tarp.",

        "Trying Alternative Collection Systems Build a rainwater garden to redirect water for landscaping.",
        "A rainwater garden uses runoff water from roofs and gutters to grow vegetation and flowers while filtering out harmful chemicals.",
        "You\u2019ll need to clear out an area of your yard to create a depression that\u2019s 3\u20134 ft (91\u2013122 cm) deep and as long and wide as you have room for!",
        "Then, use piping to extend your downspout directly into the depression to provide water for the garden.",
