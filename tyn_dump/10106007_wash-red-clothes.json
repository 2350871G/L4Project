Brand new red clothing is usually highly saturated in dye or pigment, and this can easily stain your other clothing items. To avoid bleeding or staining, clean your red garments with other red items for the first few washes. Test the color of your clothing to see if it will bleed in the wash.

Air-drying your clothes preserves their color. If you put your red clothing in the dryer, the color may fade over time. Using the Washing Machine Load your clothing into the machine and select your load size. If you fill the machine mostly full, select a full load size. If the machine is halfway full, indicate a medium load. If you are only washing a few garments, use the small load setting. Pour all-purpose detergent into the machine's detergent slot. Most machines have a detergent slot on the left-hand side. If you have a small load of laundry, fill up the cap about halfway full. If washing a large load, use a full cap of detergent. Use the lowest temperature setting to preserve the color. Turn your wash temperature to the \u201ccold\u201d setting before you start the load.

When the wash cycle is complete, remove your clothing right away.This way, they smell clean and fresh rather than soggy and mildewy. Washing Your Clothes by Hand Fill up a bathtub or sink with water to hand wash your clothes. Do this if you have delicate or fragile clothing. Once your tub or sink is about halfway full, you can turn off the water and place your garments inside. You can easily wash your garments by hand, though it may take a bit more effort than using the machine. Dump all-purpose detergent into the bathtub or sink. Fill up the cap of your detergent, and dump it into the water. Then, use your hands or a large spoon to mix it up. Use half a cap of detergent if you have a small load. Use a full cap of detergent if washing a large load. Soak and swish your clothing for 10-15 minutes. As your clothing soaks, move around each item in the soapy water to clean off dirt and debris.
