Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the links into 1-inch (2.5 cm) slices and put them into a Dutch oven or large soup pot. Chop two medium onions and add them to the pot. Cook the sausage and onions over medium heat until the sausage is cooked. Stir the sausage and onions frequently to prevent them from sticking. The sausage should no longer be pink in the center once it's finished cooking."
