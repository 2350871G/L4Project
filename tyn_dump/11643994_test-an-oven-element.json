If you were just using the oven, turn the oven off and wait 30-60 minutes for the oven to cool. Then, pull it out from the wall and unplug it. You may seriously injure yourself if you test an oven element while the oven is on. If your oven is fixed into the wall, flip the appropriate fuse on your fuse box to turn the breakers for the room off. While oven elements look different, they are almost always a single loop of metal.

        "Put the black wire\u2019s probe against the other terminal.",
        "Hold the wires still and wait 3-5 seconds for your multimeter to pick up a reading.",
        "It doesn\u2019t matter which terminal you put the red and black wires against, so long as they aren\u2019t touching one another.",
        "Interpret the results on the screen to see if the continuity is 0-50 ohms.",
        "Once your multimeter beeps or the number stops moving up and down, read the number on your screen.",
        "If it 0 or less than 1.0, your element has perfect continuity.",
        "However, some signal is often lost from one end to the other, and this is nothing to worry about so long as the loss is less than 50 ohms.",
        "If the number is higher than 50 ohms, or you see a single 1 with no decimal on the left side of your screen, your element is broken and needs to be replaced.",
        "Standard continuity readings come in the form of a double-digit number with a decimal point.",
        "A reading of 1 with no decimal point on the left side of your screen means that there is no signal whatsoever.",
        "On some multimeters, it means that the reading is so high, it can\u2019t be displayed on your screen.",
        "If the continuity is under 50 ohms and your oven still isn\u2019t heating properly, the problem is not the heating element itself.",
        "Performing Basic Checks Look at the top and bottom of the oven to find your elements.",
        "Turn your oven off and let it cool if necessary.",
        "Open the oven door and remove the metal racks.",
        "Then, look at the bottom of the oven\u2019s interior for a 0.5\u20131 in (1.3\u20132.5 cm) thick metal coil.",
        "This is your main element.",
        "Then, look at the roof of the oven to find your broiler element.",
        "The broiler element is often identical to the main element and is a metal coil wrapping around the top of the oven.",
        "Oven elements are pretty big.",
        "It is pretty easy to identify them.",
        "Turn the oven on and see if the heating elements glow red or orange.",
        "This is a fairly simple test, but one that people often skip when testing a heating element.",
        "Turn the oven on at any temperature and then check to see if your elements are orange or red.",
        "If they aren\u2019t glowing, they aren\u2019t working.",
        "If they are glowing, they\u2019re sending heat into your oven.",
        "If you test for continuity and the coils still don\u2019t glow, the problem is likely related to the wires in the back of your oven and you\u2019ll need to consult a service technician.",
        "Check to see if the element is physically broken or blistered.",
        "With your oven off and completely cooled, perform a simple check to see if there is a crack or series of scuff marks on your element.",
        "Run your hand around the coil to look for breaks or rough textures.",
        "Over time, or due to falling food items, elements can crack, and a cracked element will not transfer heat properly and needs to be replaced.",
        "If you notice your oven isn\u2019t heating evenly, a cracked or blistered heating element is often the culprit.",
        "Preheat your oven and use an oven thermometer to cross-check the heat.",
        "Preheat your oven to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
        "Wait for the beeping sound to indicate your oven has preheated.",
        "Then, put an oven thermometer inside of your oven.",
        "Wait 5-10 minutes for the thermometer to get a reading.",
        "Check to see if the temperature on the thermometer matches, or is close to 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C).",
        "If it is, any issues with your oven are not related to your heating elements.Tip: If the number on your thermometer doesn\u2019t even come close to matching the number on your oven\u2019s control panel, the problem with your oven is likely the temperature sensor, which tells your heating elements how hot to get.",
        "To resolve this problem safely, contact a service technician to repair your temperature sensor.",
        "If you do it yourself and make an improper adjustment, it will create a serious safety hazard.",
        "You can purchase an oven thermometer online or from a home supply store for $5-10."
