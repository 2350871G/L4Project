Tie it to the other side.  Cut off one side.  Take the side you cut off and tie it where the cheek is.  Wrap it under the cheek (not over it).  Tie it. You are done! Advanced halter Fold the ribbon around a jump ring so that about a centimeter is on the other side. Glue or sew it down. With the ribbon still at its full length, measure it so that it reaches the other side of the horse's mouth. Cut it a little longer than that. Sew the end around another jump ring.

Hold the jump rings around you horse's mouth, so that each one is on one cheek with the ribbon on the top. With the other piece or ribbon that is sewn to one side of the jump ring, measure so that is halfway under the horse's chin. Cut the ribbon and sew to a jump ring. Sew a piece of ribbon to each of the jump rings to form a circle around your horse's nose. Put to one side. Once this has been completed, sew a piece of ribbon to a jump ring. Measure the back of the horse's head so that the jump ring is underneath his head. Sew another piece of ribbon to the other side.

Measure it so that the ribbon is on the top of the horse's head. Cut and sew a small buckle or jump ring to it. With the other jump ring, sew a piece of ribbon to it. Make sure that it can reach the buckle and cut. Fold the end over and sew it, so that it does not fray. Go back to the nose band. Sew one piece of ribbon to each jump ring so they all face the same way. Finally, measure the length of your horse's head. Sew each of the ribbons from the nose band to three jump rings on the head piece. Now you have an adjustable halter to fit your model horse. Slip-knot halter Make a slip-knot in a piece string or whatever other item you are using for a halter.  See if the slip-knot fits the horse's head.
