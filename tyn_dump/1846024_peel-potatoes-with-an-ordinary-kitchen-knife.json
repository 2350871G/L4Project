    "text": " Cleaning the Potatoes Place your potatoes on a cutting board near the side of your sink. Place a colander on the other side of the sink. If you don\u2019t have a colander, then place folded paper towels or a kitchen towel opposite the cutting board. These will absorb the water that collects after you wash the potatoes. Rinse each potato under cold running water as you scrub the potato with a sponge or a nylon bristled brush to loosen dirt and debris.  Set the clean potatoes in your colander or on top of your paper towels or kitchen towel.  Continue rinsing and scrubbing until all potatoes are clean.  Peeling an Uncooked Potato Position the potato on the cutting board. Make sure that the length of the potato is parallel to the edge of the countertop. Slice off one end of the potato. The slice should be no more than 1/4\u201d (6 mm) thick, and the slice should be cut at a 90-degree angle. Slicing off the bottom of the potato will enable the potato to be placed upright on the cutting board without requiring any stabilization. Stand the potato up with the sliced end on the bottom. Hold the rounded top of the potato with your non-dominant hand. Peel one section of the potato at a time with a sharp knife. Start at the top of the potato and peel off the skin until your knife reaches the bottom of the potato. Try not to take off too much of the white flesh of the potato as you peel. Rotate the potato and peel another section. Continue peeling until all of the brown peel has been removed. Remove any sprouts, or \u201ceyes,\u201d that have developed on the potato using the tip of your knife. Repeat the peeling process until all of your potatoes are peeled. Then, prepare the potatoes according to your recipe. Peeling a Hot Potato Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil on your stovetop. The pot should be large enough to hold the potatoes, and you should have enough water to cover the potatoes completely. Add a generous pinch of salt to your boiling water if you want to. This will help to flavor the potatoes if you don\u2019t like them plain. Place the potatoes into the boiling water. You can use tongs, or if you don\u2019t have tongs you can gently slip them on with one hand; make sure the potatoes are as close to the water as possible, or even partially submerged, so that you avoid scalding yourself with hot water. Boil the potatoes until they are tender. To check if they\u2019re ready, spear one with a fork. If the fork goes through the flesh easily, they\u2019re cooked. Remove the potatoes from the boiling water and place them on your cutting board. You can either strain them or pour them directly into your clean sink to drain. Spear the potato with a two-pronged fork. Hold the fork with your non-dominant hand. The fork should go directly through the middle of the potato so that you do not have to touch the hot potato with your fingers. Grasp the handle of a paring knife with your dominant hand and place the blade against the bottom of the potato.  Draw the knife toward the top of the potato. The peel should slip off easily as you move your knife. Be careful not to cut off too much of the white flesh. Use tongs to handle the potatoes if they are too hot to touch after they are peeled. Repeat the process until all of the potatoes are peeled. Then, prepare the potatoes according to your recipe.",
