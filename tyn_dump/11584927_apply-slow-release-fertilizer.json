                    "description": "Take a tape measure and stretch it across the length and width of your yard. Jot down the measurements on a scrap piece of paper, so you can quickly calculate the total square footage of your yard. Divide your yard\u2019s square footage by the total weight of a fertilizer bag to determine how much product you need for your property. If you\u2019re working with a small pot or container, sprinkle a small amount of fertilizer over the surface of the soil. If you own a large piece of property, try using blueprints to determine the total area. Tip: Use a measuring tape to measure the square footage of your yard. Next, check your bag of slow-release fertilizer to see how much area it covers. For instance, if you have a 36 lb (16 kg) bag of fertilizer that covers 2,500 square feet (230 m) of yard, solve this equation: 36 divided by 2.5. This will tell you that you need 14.4 lb (6.5 kg) of fertilizer per 1,000 square feet (93 m). If your yard is 3,000 square feet (280 m), you\u2019ll need two 36 lb (16 kg) bags of fertilizer. You need to use 2.5 instead of 2,500 to get a non-decimal result from the equation."

If your soil is high in phosphorus, use a slow-release fertilizer with a 20-5-10 label. If your soil is high in nitrogen or potassium, choose fertilizers with lower amounts of these nutrients, like 4-6-0. If you\u2019re planting sweet corn, use a fertilizer with a 2-2-1 NPK ratio. Vegetable gardens do best with a 1-1-1. Check the needs of the specific crop you\u2019d like to plant before purchasing a fertilizer.
