                    "description": "The grind of your beans is going to be a large factor in how close you get to having a drink that resembles an espresso. If you are buying ground beans, then look for an espresso grind. If you are grinding your own beans, still look for coffee that says \"espresso beans\" or \"espresso\". While there is no actual espresso type of bean, often commercial roasters will have an espresso bean. This will give you a taste and consistency to which you are used to because it is roasted to bring out the espresso flavor. If you grind your own beans, you will want a grinder that can offer you an espresso grind. Burr grinders are grinders which actually grind the beans between two burrs. These grinders crunch up a few beans at a time and grind the bean into a nice even powder. Blade grinders can be effective as well. However, with a blade grinder, you\u2019re using a sharp propeller to chop the beans. This method can be less consistent. The espresso ground is very fine. It is finer than what you would have if you were grinding beans for a regular French press or a drip coffee maker. The fine ground contributes to the flavor and ability to mix with the hot pressure of water. You don\u2019t want an espresso grind to be so fine that it goes through your filter. The problem with this fine of a grind in a French press is that the filter has a larger mesh. It should be like sand. You may then want to make your grind slightly more coarse, but not much. Unless you don\u2019t mind a bit of grounds in the bottom of your cup."

        "The grind of your beans is going to be a large factor in how close you get to having a drink that resembles an espresso.",
        "If you are buying ground beans, then look for an espresso grind.",
        "If you are grinding your own beans, still look for coffee that says \"espresso beans\" or \"espresso\".",
        "While there is no actual espresso type of bean, often commercial roasters will have an espresso bean.",
        "This will give you a taste and consistency to which you are used to because it is roasted to bring out the espresso flavor.",
        "If you grind your own beans, you will want a grinder that can offer you an espresso grind.",
        "Burr grinders are grinders which actually grind the beans between two burrs.",
        "These grinders crunch up a few beans at a time and grind the bean into a nice even powder.",
        "Blade grinders can be effective as well.",
        "However, with a blade grinder, you\u2019re using a sharp propeller to chop the beans.",
        "This method can be less consistent.",
        "The espresso ground is very fine.",
        "It is finer than what you would have if you were grinding beans for a regular French press or a drip coffee maker.",
        "The fine ground contributes to the flavor and ability to mix with the hot pressure of water.",
        "You don\u2019t want an espresso grind to be so fine that it goes through your filter.",
        "The problem with this fine of a grind in a French press is that the filter has a larger mesh.",
        "It should be like sand.",
        "You may then want to make your grind slightly more coarse, but not much.",
        "Unless you don\u2019t mind a bit of grounds in the bottom of your cup.",
        "Add your grounds to your press.",
        "Pour roughly 36 grams (1.3 oz) of grounds into your press.",
        "This part is a bit tricky because you are trying to make espresso.",
        "Which when prepared in an espresso machine uses about 16-21 grams of grounds per 1 cup of water.",
        "Since your French press is larger, try doubling your proportions.",
        "You\u2019ll have some espresso left over but that\u2019s ok. Pour a splash of near boiling water over the grounds.",
        "Then after a few seconds add the remainder of your two cups of water.",
        "Your water should not exceed 200\u00b0 F, around 195\u00b0 F is ideal.",
        "Before pouring in your full two cups of water, just add a splash to let the grounds flour and bloom.",
        "This will open the grounds up and let the flavors really come out.",
        "Stir your brew.",
        "Give the brew a quick stir with a long-handled spoon to prevent clumps and add a nice frothy consistency.",
        "Then push the lid/filter assembly down until it just rests on the water.",
        "Don\u2019t plunge your filter down yet.",
        "You need to let the coffee steep.",
        "Steep your brew.",
        "Let it steep until the coffee is very dark (about 3-4 minutes).",
        "The longer you steep, the stronger your coffee will be.",
        "However, this does not mean that you should steep your espresso too long just to get a stronger, more espresso-like flavor.",
        "Steeping is another area for experimentation.",
        "Just be aware of one rule: The length of steep time controls extraction.",
        "Too short and the coffee will be under-extracted and sour; too long and the coffee will be over-extracted and bitter.",
        "Press your brew.",
        "Hold the lid to steady and press the plunger down slowly in a steady, even manner until it stops.",
        "You may want to experiment with plunging halfway, bringing it up, and then plunging it down all the way to create a thin layer of foam.",
        "Let your brew set briefly before pouring.",
        "Pour your coffee through a clean cloth or a coffee filter if you want to catch any of the very fine sediment.",
        "Note that pouring through a paper filter will alter the consistency and flavor of your drink slightly.",
        "The paper will catch some of the texture of your drink, and possibly transfer an oily essence as your coffee steeps through.",
        "Frothing Hot Milk\\/Cream for Espresso Heat the milk.",
        "Pour at least 1/2 cup of milk in a medium saucepan and heat on low or medium.",
        "Heat the milk until it is warmed through.",
        "You don\u2019t want your milk to boil.",
        "Heat just until it starts to bubble then turn the stove off.",
        "The thicker the milk or cream you use, the thicker your foam will be.",
        "However, using 2% or low-fat milk may be easier if you are frothing by hand.",
        "Lower-fat milks usually include whey proteins that are critical stabilizers for milk foam.",
        "Prepare your espresso in your French Press.",
        "While the milk is being heated, make your espresso using the first method.",
        "You can also heat the milk while the beverage is steeping.",
        "Remove the milk from heat.",
        "Do this while the coffee is steeping.",
        "Place the pan on a towel or surface that isn\u2019t hot but that won\u2019t get damaged by the heat from the pan.",
        "Blend the milk.",
        "Angle your pot and set an immersion blender in the shallow end of the pot.",
        "Froth the milk on high speed until the foam holds, about 2 to 3 minutes blending on high.",
        "If you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, you can use a whisk and stir the milk in a smaller container.",
        "Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands.",
        "Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.",
        "Pour the frothy milk into a jar with a lid.",
        "Once you\u2019ve poured your milk, tighten the lid and give the jar a good shake.",
        "Don\u2019t fill the jar more than halfway.",
        "This won\u2019t leave enough room for the milk to foam.",
        "Shake until the milk is bubbly and nice and foamy.",
        "You should be shaking for about 30 to 60 seconds.",
        "Then microwave the jar (making sure you have a microwave safe jar) for about 30 seconds.",
        "This allows the foam to rise to the top.",
        "Pour your espresso coffee.",
        "Divide the coffee out amongst the cups and spoon the frothed milk on top of each.",
        "Serve immediately.",
        "You can also pour the leftover milk into your drink if you like milk in your drink.",
        "Frothing Cold Milk\\/Cream for Espresso Chill about 1/2 cup of milk in a small glass or stainless steel bowl.",
        "Place the bowl in the freezer for 15 to 30 minutes, or until the temperature reaches just above freezing.",
        "The thicker the milk or cream you use, the thicker your foam will be.",
        "However, using 2% or low-fat milk may be easier if you are frothing by hand.",
        "Lower-fat milks usually include whey proteins that are critical stabilizers for milk foam.",
        "Check on your bowl to make sure the milk hasn\u2019t frozen.",
        "There should not be any ice crystals.",
        "Prepare your espresso in your French Press.",
        "While the milk is being cooled, make your espresso using the first method.",
        "You can then make the foam while your coffee is steeping.",
        "Remove the bowl from the freezer.",
        "Once you remove the cold milk from your freezer set it on a towel on your counter top.",
        "You can now go about frothing your milk in a couple of ways.",
        "One way is to proceed as you would with milk heated on the stove.",
        "Blend the milk, then shake and microwave.",
        "Another way is to blend and shake.",
        "But not microwave.",
        "Tip the bowl and insert your immersion blender.",
        "You can also pour your milk into a smaller container for easier blending or whisking.",
        "Blend until there is a good, stiff froth.",
        "If you don\u2019t have an immersion blender, you can use a whisk and stir the milk in a smaller container.",
        "Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands.",
        "Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.",
        "Pour the frothy milk into a jar with a lid.",
        "Once you\u2019ve poured your milk, tighten the lid and give the jar a good shake.",
        "Don\u2019t fill the jar more than halfway.",
        "This won\u2019t leave enough room for the milk to foam.",
        "Shake until the milk is bubbly and nice and foamy.",
        "You should be shaking for about 30 to 60 seconds.",
        "You can leave the cold froth as is, or microwave if you want extra foam.",
        "Leaving the froth cold will mean that you have to scoop it right away onto your drink before it settles back in.",
        "Spoon out the froth onto your coffee and enjoy.",
        "Take a spoon and place a dollop of froth onto the top of your drink.",
        "Sprinkle with cinnamon for added flavor.",
        "You can also pour the milk mixture into your drink if you like.",
        "Making Whipped Cream For Espresso Prepare your ingredients for whipped cream.",
        "For those who would like to use whipped cream, this is a basic recipe:\n1/2 pint heavy cream, chilled\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoons powdered sugar Whip the cream.",
        "Using a stick blender or whisk, whip the cream in a large bowl until soft peaks form.",
        "It sometimes help to whip the cream and get a fluffier consistency if you use a metal bowl and whisk.",
        "Place the cream in the bowl with the whisk and let it sit in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "You may also want to add some sugar before you start whisking.",
        "the sugar will help the cream to clump and form.",
        "Add the vanilla and the sugar.",
        "Continue to beat the mixture until it reaches the consistency of whipped cream.",
        "You can place your bowl back in the fridge to cool if you are still brewing your beverage.",
        "Prepare your espresso in your French Press.",
        "While the cream is cooling in the bowl, make your espresso using the first method.",
        "You can then finish making your whipped cream while your beverage steeps, if you haven't yet.",
        "Make sure that you've whipped your mixture so it's fluffy and not runny.",
        "Add a dollop of whip cream to your beverage.",
        "Once you have your desired consistency, add a dollop to your beverage.",
        "You can also stir the whipped cream into your beverage if you want more of a Frappuccino\u00ae drink.",
        "Finished."
