Caulking and paint both act like glues and will make it much more difficult to pry the molding off without damaging it or the wall or ceiling.

    "text": " Prying Crown Molding Off Place a drop sheet on the floor underneath the crown molding. Lay down a canvas drop cloth, tarp, or plastic sheet on the floor underneath where you will be removing the molding to protect the floor. This will catch any debris and make it easier to clean up after. If you don't have any kind of drop sheet, you could lay down some newspapers or pieces of cardboard as an alternative. Put on protective eyewear and work gloves. Wear a pair of safety glasses or goggles to protect your eyes from any falling debris as you remove the molding. Wear a pair of work gloves to protect your hands from scrapes and other accidents. Score the edges of the molding with a utility knife. Use the tip of a sharp utility knife to carefully slice along the entire top and bottom edges of the crown molding where it meets the wall and the ceiling.

Salvaging Molding to Reuse It Lay a section of molding face-down on a flat surface. Place the section of crown molding that you want to reuse face-down so the back side with the nails is exposed. This will allow you to pull the nails out without damaging the front of the molding. Use a pair of end cutting pliers to pull the nails through the back of the molding.

This is much more likely to damage the crown molding. End cutting pliers are also known as nippers, end cutters, or end cutting pincers. Scrape off excess paint or caulking with a thin putty knife or utility knife. Use the flat edge of a thin putty knife or the blade of a utility knife to carefully scrape away any pieces of paint or caulking that are stuck to the back or the edges of the molding. Pieces of paint or caulking can make reinstallation of the molding more difficult because it won\u2019t sit flat against the wall and ceiling.
