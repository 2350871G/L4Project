Find out what is needed at your school's open house day. If your school doesn't have a uniform rule, then wear whatever you want as long as you stay within the dress code. Have a variety of clothing: basics, such as jeans, solid colored t-shirts, and solid jackets. That should make up about 70% of your closet. The other 30% can be weekend t-shirts, splattered/color jeans or trousers, and favorite jackets. If you're not familiar with the dress code, most of the time it's two finger spacing for tank tops, shorts can't be more than three inches above the knee, and the neckline of your shirt has to be three inches from the base of your neck. Wear something that the dress code will allow, and try to look as nice as possible. You want to make a good first impression, so dress to impress."

Don't worry if you aren't allowed to wear it or simply prefer not to. Some good things to start off with are B.B.
