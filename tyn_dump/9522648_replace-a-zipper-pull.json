Use a thin ribbon if you want a nicer touch. Choose satin or grosgrain ribbon thin enough to fit through the loop on your zipper pull. Cut it down to 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm), then feed it through the loop. Match up the ends of the ribbon to make sure that it is centered, then finish it in 1 of the following ways:\nTie the ends together in an overhand knot to make a loop.
