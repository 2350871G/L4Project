You may need to adjust your cut settings based on the type of vinyl you use. For example, flocked vinyl may have a different setting than glossy vinyl. Choosing a Type of Heat Transfer Vinyl\nIf you want a bold design, choose vinyl in neon colors or with a bright pattern. For a glamorous shirt, go with metallic vinyl in gold or silver. If you want a super unique shirt, use glow-in-the-dark vinyl. For a little extra sparkle, opt for glitter or holographic vinyl. If you want a design with texture, pick embossed vinyl, which has raised bumps, or pick flocked vinyl, which feels similar to velvet."
