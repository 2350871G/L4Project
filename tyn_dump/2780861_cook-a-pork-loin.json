Some people prefer to cook meat to 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C), which used to be the recommended temperature to kill organisms, but has recently been amended. Thaw the pork tenderloin, if you have not already. Place it in the refrigerator overnight. Use the tenderloin within 1 to 2 days of thawing. Cut excess fat off the tenderloin, if you desire. If you see a large chunk of fat and you would like a leaner meal, cut it off with a boning knife or chef's knife. Pay attention to the weight of your pork loin. It should be packaged with a weight written on it by the supermarket. Knowing the weight will help you cook it for the right amount of time. Seasoning Rub the pork loin with a good amount of black pepper and salt. Some people prefer using these simple seasonings to bring out the natural flavor of this excellent cut of meat. Consider using other rubs or spices. You can marinate the pork for 1 to 8 hours. Find a marinade that you like.

Once it starts to turn a caramel brown, turn it over to brown the next side. Browning the entire loin should take between 5 and 8 minutes. Cooking Method Consider the many ways you can roast a pork loin. The one you choose may depend upon the time you have and the seasonings or marinade you used.
