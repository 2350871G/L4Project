The most basic Tiki bar, for example, would just be a bamboo-lined bar without a roof or floor. But you could also build a deck, a frame to hang things from, and the classic thatched roof if desired. Pick and choose from the following steps depending on your desires and skill level. A beautiful bar can be formed with just a small roof and place to mix drinks."

To make the floor, you have three simple steps:\nNail 4 pressure treated fence posts, or 4 4x4s, into a flat rectangular base, laying the post on their sides. Use a level to ensure it is flush with the ground. Slide 2x4s into the frame every 16\", starting from the center, and use deck screws to secure them. This should look a bit like a wooden jail cell door at this stage. Lay pressure treated boards over the frame to form the floor, leaving 1/4 between each board for drainage and to account for wood expansion. Secure with deck screws."

Pick and choose from the following steps depending on your desires and skill level. A beautiful bar can be formed with just a small roof and place to mix drinks. Build a pressure-treated floor. This step is optional, but if you're going to do it, it has to come first. To make the floor, you have three simple steps:\nNail 4 pressure treated fence posts, or 4 4x4s, into a flat rectangular base, laying the post on their sides. Use a level to ensure it is flush with the ground. Slide 2x4s into the frame every 16\", starting from the center, and use deck screws to secure them. This should look a bit like a wooden jail cell door at this stage.

You can also make a lean-to Tiki bar, allowing you to bracket these posts to the side of the house or an exterior wall.

Adhere them to the deck the same way as you did the back wall -- with brackets on the bottom. Note that this front wall is smaller than the back wall. The smaller front wall allows you to have a slanted roof. Use one 2x4 to attach the front two posts to each other and one to attach the back two posts. You'll have two upside-down U-shaped frames.

        "Secure with deck screws.",
        "Use two 96 inch planks to build a back wall.",
        "Use two L-brackets on each post to attach these posts to the deck.",
        "You can also make a lean-to Tiki bar, allowing you to bracket these posts to the side of the house or an exterior wall.",
        "Creating a lean-to requires a bit less finesse, especially if you're not an experienced contractor.",
        "Create the front wall frame with two 82 inch planks.",
        "Adhere them to the deck the same way as you did the back wall -- with brackets on the bottom.",
        "Note that this front wall is smaller than the back wall.",
        "The smaller front wall allows you to have a slanted roof.",
        "Use one 2x4 to attach the front two posts to each other and one to attach the back two posts.",
        "You'll have two upside-down U-shaped frames.",
        "Measure the distance between the two back posts, cut a 2x4 to fit between them, then use lag bolts to create a frame.",
        "The front wall should be one U, the back wall another.",
        "Use 5-inch corner braces to provide more security when holding the wall frames together.",
        "Bridge the front and back wall posts with another 2x4.",
        "Cut a 2x4 to fit between the front and back walls.",
        "Attach it horizontally from the top of the front post to the back wall frame.",
        "Use lag bolts to screw the plank in, then brackets on both sides to secure it.",
        "Repeat on the other side.",
        "You'll have the beginnings of a cube-shape.",
        "Cut a right angle notch in seven 2x4x9 boards and use them to form rafters.",
        "These boards make the frame for the roof.",
        "Lay a board on its side between the front and back frames -- it should naturally slope down.",
        "Mark the point where the board hits the lower beam (the front wall) and then cut out a small notch so that the board snaps into place on the front wall.",
        "For a really professional look, cut diagonally from this notch to the shorter end of the plank so that, when attached, the bottom of the rafter is parallel to the ground.",
        "Use metal hangers or small brackets to attach the rafters to the back wall.",
        "The notch should keep the boards in place, but use brackets to ensure it stays together.",
        "Assemble a frame for the actual bar.",
        "It should be 42\" high and 24\" deep.",
        "To do so, cut three identical pieces of plywood or poplar boards -- two for the side walls of the bar, one for a center support.",
        "Measure and cut the top of the bar to fit over these three boards, then use framing nails and wood glue to form the bar.",
        "It should look like an upside-down capital \"E.\"\nThe width of this bar is up to you, but you'll likely want a second support panel in the middle if you go wider than 75\".",
        "Cut and add shelves in the two sections of the bar.",
        "Using more poplar boards or plywood, cut as many shelves as you desire for the inside of the bar.",
        "Use framing nails and wood glue to secure them to the plywood walls and support.",
        "You can also use more L-brackets to provide a bit more support to the shelves if desired.",
        "Nail plywood to the front posts and bar frame to form the front of the bar.",
        "Obviously, measure and cut the plywood to fit your specific dimensions, aiming for something roughly 42 inches high.",
        "Use framing nails to nail the boards together and wood glue to keep them secure.",
        "Don't worry about the look of the bar just yet -- you'll cover up the ugly plywood later.",
        "Sand and stain the top of the bar.",
        "Be sure to use something water resistant so people can spill drinks without messing up your wood.",
        "Consider a layer of polyurethane to completely protect and waterproof the top.",
        "For a truly professional Tiki bar, you should sand and stain the entire frame, and consider coating it all if the bar is outside.",
        "Buy and drape a mat of \"Mexican thatch\" to the roof pillars.",
        "You could also use corrugated iron sheets for a slightly different effect.",
        "First, lay down a sheet of plastic over the whole roof, which will prevent hay from falling into drinks.",
        "Use an electric stapler to adhere the plastic to the roof, then staple the thatching onto the plastic.",
        "Try to leave 6\" or so of overhang on the ends of the roof so that it \"drips\" over the bar.",
        "Decorating Your Bar Cover any plywood with bamboo paneling, woven matting, or palm fronds.",
        "Choose the decor you like best.",
        "Woven matting and bamboo paneling are probably the easiest to add, but palm fronds are a good way to add some frills if desired.",
        "Hang a woven mat, or nail up more paneling, for the back wall as well.",
        "Another idea is to use stencils and paint to make the front of the bar look like salvaged wood.",
        "Write things like \"FRAGILE,\" \"South Seas Trading Company,\" \"Rum Shipment,\" etc.",
        "Use split bamboo rods to cover up corners and edges.",
        "Long bamboo rods cut in half can take out any right-angles you have, lending a softer edge to lean on as well as a bit of essential Tiki ambiance.",
        "Bamboo can be cut easily with a table saw, but you can also buy it pre-split from some retailers.",
        "Add some hanging lamps, lanterns, Tiki torches, or multi-color Christmas lights.",
        "Most Tiki bars have dark, atmospheric lighting, so don't feel like you need to go overboard.",
        "All of the options above can also be mixed and matched to create your own personal look.",
        "Be very careful with any torches or real flames -- a thatched roof is especially flammable.",
        "Pick up some Polynesian masks, statues, or heads for decoration.",
        "Tiki is actually a Californian invention, meaning some \"stereotypical\" decorations are a part of the package.",
        "For a true Tiki feel, don't shy away from fake shrunken heads, wooden masks, and a few bamboo art.",
        "Install wicker or bamboo bar stools.",
        "Don't stop the bamboo parade with the bar -- make sure the stools match!",
        "Throw up some fishing gear, like nets, shells, mounted fish, etc.",
        "Tiki bars are supposed to be on the beach, so give people a beachy atmosphere to enjoy.",
        "Fishing nets can be tacked to walls or posts, shells glued to the back wall or scattered on the bar, and a big, mounted marlin or other salt-water fish proudly displayed nearby.",
        "Old, woven rope is a cheap and easy way to add some ambiance as well.",
        "Try wrapping it around the bottom of posts or use it to hide the joints in your construction.",
        "Use a faux rust coating to give any metal a weathered, salt-sprayed look.",
        "A small touch, but a good one for authenticity, is weathered brackets and fixtures.",
        "If you've got any exposed metal, such as L-brackets holding beams together, give them a quick once-over with a rust coating to give them an authentically beachy vibe.",
        "Making Tiki-Themed Drinks Keep several types of rum on hand to make most tiki-themed drinks.",
        "Rum is king in Tiki bars, and even if you don't feel like mixing up cocktails or blended drinks, a couple bottles of rum will cover the basics for you.",
        "You should consider a light rum, a dark rum, and an overproof rum at a minimum.",
        "Citrus juices, from pineapple to orange, are also good mixers and common Tiki ingredients.",
        "Orgeat is an almond-flavored spirit common in many Tiki drinks.",
        "Many tiki drinks, like the classic Pi\u00f1a Colada, require a blender as well.",
        "Make some rum swizzles.",
        "Best served with an authentic swizzle stick -- a branch from a long Caribbean plant -- these classic drinks go well with a cinnamon stick in a pinch, which should be used to stir everything into a nice froth.",
        "Mix the following in a pitcher and shake or churn until it is frothing, then serve over ice:\n4 ounces dark rum\n4 ounces light rum\n8 ounces pineapple juice\n8 ounces orange juice\n.75 ounces Grenadine\n5-6 dashes bitters Whip up a few Fog Cutters.",
        "These strong cocktails disappeared from the bar scene for years, only to reappear in the fog-soaked San Francisco Bay.",
        "They have since become a staple of Tiki bars across the country.",
        "Mix everything but the sherry, which you pour on top of the finished drink.",
        "Top with a fresh mint leaf when available.",
        "2 ounces orange juice\n1 ounce lemon juice\n1/2 ounce orgeat\n1 1/2 ounce clear rum\n1/2 ounce gin\n1/2 ounce brandy\n1/2 ounce sherry (poured on top at the end) Master Mai-Tais.",
        "This is the quintessential Tiki cocktail, and if you want to make a Tiki bar you're going to need to know how to make one.",
        "3/4 ounces lime juice\n1/4 ounce simple syrup\n1/4 orgeat syrup\n1/2 ounce orange curacao (orange juice can be supplemented in a pinch)\n2 ounces rum Pour out a Pi\u00f1a Colada.",
        "The classic beach cocktail, immortalized in songs and Tiki bars across the country, is the Pi\u00f1a Colada.",
        "Making it requires a blender, and, if you have it, a tall, curved glass to serve in.",
        "1 1/2 ounces light rum\n2 ounces coconut milk\n2 ounces pineapple juice Blend up a classic Scorpion.",
        "This cocktail, like most Tiki drinks, has its roots in Trader Vic's, the original Tiki bar from the 1950's.",
        "To make it, simply blend the following ingredients for 10-15 seconds in a blender:\n2 ounces orange juice\n1 1/2 ounce lemon juice\n1/2 ounce orgeat syrup\n2 ounces light rum\n1 ounce brandy\n1 cup crushed ice"
