However, if you\u2019re drying the gravel indoors or outside on a cold day, it may take up to 8 hours to dry. You can speed the process by running a hair dryer over the gravel. Turn the hair dryer on the high-heat setting and move it back and forth across the gravel to dry it. Repeat for about 5-10 minutes or until all of the gravel is dry.Tip: You may also dry off the gravel with a towel. Press a dry towel against the gravel, shake or stir it around, and then blot it with a towel again. Keep doing this until the gravel is completely dry."
