Basements and cellars are among the best choices since they\u2019ll already be cooler than other parts of your home, but you could also use a game room, spare bedroom, or even an unused closet. The exact size of your wine cellar will depend on the space you have available, as well as the amount of wine you want to preserve. When it comes to wine cellars, the cooler, the better. If possible, pick out a room that receives little or no direct exposure to sunlight throughout the day.Warning: Don't designate an attic or garage for your wine cellar, as these spaces tend to be difficult to insulate properly."

Try to select a room that contains at least one door, window, or air vent to allow the warm air to escape. Most cooling systems only guarantee a 30-50 degree temperature differential. For this reason, it\u2019s important that the adjacent room be no warmer than 85\u2013100 \u00b0F (29\u201338 \u00b0C) to maintain the recommended temperature of 50\u201355 \u00b0F (10\u201313 \u00b0C)  in the cellar. If you\u2019re building your wine cellar in a basement, you won\u2019t have to worry about ventilating any other rooms, as the warm air will simply be dispersed outside."

This means the insulation will be about 5.5 inches (14 cm) thick on each side, with a 10 in (25 cm) layer along the ceiling.

For maximum protection and durability, use a polyvinyl acetate (PVA) paint formula. PVA paints offer a smooth, resilient finish and serve as an additional barrier against moisture. Painting in small, enclosed spaces increase your risk of exposure to harmful fumes. Be sure to open any nearby doors and windows and leave the air conditioning or a portable fan running to promote ventilation. Another possible option is to have wood paneling installed rather than painting. Choose a rot-resistant type of wood, such as redwood, cedar, or pressure-treated pine, to prevent warping as a result of the surrounding humidity."
