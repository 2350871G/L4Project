        "The more flexible the instrument, the less likely it'll be to mark up the wall.",
        "If you discover a second layer of wallpaper underneath the first, focus on removing the top layer completely before thinking about the second layer.",
        "That bottom layer will come up much more easily if the first layer is completely gone.",

        "Underneath the wallpaper and backing, you will see a sticky layer of glue that was originally used to put up the wallpaper.",

        "Once the spackling paste is completely dry, lightly sand the patched area.",
        "This will even out any sections that were partially raised and will give the patched section a smooth finish.",
