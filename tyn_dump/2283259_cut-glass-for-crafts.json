Use cut-resistant gloves meant for glass-cutting so you can still handle your pieces easily without hurting yourself. Make sure to always wear the safety glasses and gloves while you\u2019re working. You can buy cut-resistant gloves from hardware or craft supply stores. Draw the shape you want to cut on your piece of glass. Use a fine-point marker to draw the line for your cut. If you want your line to be straight, use a ruler or another straightedge. Don\u2019t draw the line too thick, or else the marker will be visible after you make your cut. If you don\u2019t want to draw directly on the glass, put a piece of paper with the shape you want to draw underneath the glass so you can trace it with the glass cutter.

        "Make sure the pliers don\u2019t cover any part of your cut or else it won\u2019t make a clean edge when you break it.",
        "If you\u2019re worried about the pliers scratching your piece of glass, wrap the ends with masking tape.",
        "Push down on the glass to break it along the cut.",
        "Place your nondominant hand on the side of the score line that\u2019s opposite from the pliers.",
        "Hold the pliers steady and gently push down on the glass with your nondominant hand.",
        "The glass will break along the line and leave a smooth edge.",
        "If the piece of glass doesn\u2019t break along the score line, then flip it over and try using the glass cutter again to make the cut slightly deeper.",
        "Using a Bottle Cutter Clean any paper or adhesive off of a glass bottle.",
        "Peel any labels or paper off of the bottle\u2019s surface as much as you can so you don\u2019t need to cut through them.",
        "If there is any stuck-on adhesive, wipe the bottle with a cleaning rag and adhesive remover.",
        "Continue wiping the bottle until it\u2019s completely clean.",
        "If you\u2019re cutting your bottle above or below the label, you don\u2019t need to remove the paper or adhesive if you don\u2019t want to.",
        "Set the bottle on top of the rollers on a bottle cutter.",
        "Set up the bottle cutter on a flat surface so the 2-3 rollers are face-up.",
        "Look for the small metal scoring wheel on the side of the bottle cutter, and set the bottle on top of the cutter so the wheel lines up with the line you want to cut.",
        "Make sure the bottle touches at least 2 of the rollers so it can spin easily.",
        "You can buy a bottle cutter from a craft store or online.",
        "Adjust the scoring blade so it touches the bottle.",
        "If the scoring wheel doesn\u2019t touch the bottle, loosen the screw holding it in place with either a screwdriver or a hex wrench.",
        "Position the scoring wheel so it touches the bottle so it can cut the glass.",
        "Once the wheel is in position, tighten it again so it doesn\u2019t fall out of place.",
        "The tool you need to adjust the scoring wheel depends on the bottle cutter you\u2019re using.",
        "Rotate the bottle on the rollers to make a score line.",
        "Press down gently on the bottle so the scoring wheel etches into the glass.",
        "Slowly rotate the bottle on the rollers while applying pressure so the score line goes completely around the glass.",
        "Complete 2 full rotations around the bottle to ensure that the score is deep enough for the bottle to break easily.",
        "Don\u2019t press too hard on the bottle or else you might shatter it.",
        "Pour hot water over the line you scored on the bottle.",
        "Heat water on your stove or in the microwave until it\u2019s about 180\u2013200 \u00b0F (82\u201393 \u00b0C).",
        "Hold the bottle over your sink so you can easily pour the water onto the score line.",
        "Slowly pour the water onto the end of the bottle with the score line, and rotate it so the glass heats up evenly.",
        "If the bottle gets too hot to hold, wear an oven mitt so you don\u2019t burn yourself.",
        "Dip the bottle in ice water to break it along the score line.",
        "As soon as you\u2019re finished pouring the hot water on the bottle, dip it into a bowl filled with ice water.",
        "The sudden temperature change will cause the bottle to break into 2 pieces along the score line.",
        "Once the bottle breaks, pull it out of the water and dry it off with a towel.",
        "If the bottle doesn\u2019t break immediately, then repeat pouring hot water and dipping it in cold water until it does.",
        "Sand any rough edges with 220-grit sandpaper.",
        "If the bottle has jagged edges, apply a firm amount of pressure to the glass with 220-grit sandpaper to smooth it out.",
        "Continue working around the edge of the bottle until it\u2019s smooth to the touch and there aren\u2019t any shards that could hurt you.",
        "If the edges of the bottle are very uneven, it may be difficult to sand the bottle to the shape you want.",
        "Try cutting another bottle instead since it\u2019s easier.Tip: Wet the piece of sandpaper if it\u2019s difficult to smooth out the rough edges.",
        "Cutting Bottles with Yarn Cut a length of yarn that can wrap around the bottle 3-4 times.",
        "Use a fabric or acrylic piece of yarn since they are the most absorbent and work the best.",
        "Wrap the end of the yarn around the bottle along the line you want to cut 3-4 times to find the length you need.",
        "Unwind the yarn and use a pair of scissors to cut it.",
        "You can also use twine if you don\u2019t have any yarn.",
        "Don\u2019t use thread or string since it\u2019s too thin to cut through the glass.",
        "Soak the yarn in acetone nail polish remover.",
        "Fill a small bowl with acetone nail polish remover and dip the piece of yarn into it.",
        "Make sure the yarn is completely saturated with the acetone, or else you won\u2019t be able to cut the bottle well.",
        "Pull the yarn out from the acetone and shake any excess off of the surface.",
        "You can buy acetone nail polish remover from convenience stores.",
        "Wrap the yarn around the bottle where you want to cut it.",
        "Take the acetone-soaked yarn and rewrap it around the bottle it the place you measured it.",
        "Once you loop it around the bottle the third or fourth time, tuck the end of the yarn underneath the loops to hold it in place.",
        "Push the loops as close together as you can to make the cut more precise.Tip: If the yarn still doesn\u2019t stay in place, cut a new piece of yarn that\u2019s 2\u20133 inches (5.1\u20137.6 cm) longer so you can tie a knot.",
        "Light the yarn on fire with a lighter.",
        "Hold the bottle over your sink so you don\u2019t risk burning anything else.",
        "Hold the lighter underneath your bottle and light the yarn so it catches on fire.",
        "Rotate the bottle so the flame spreads evenly around the yarn wrapped onto the bottle.",
        "The fire will burn the acetone and heat the yarn and bottle so it\u2019s easier to break.",
        "Be very careful while working with an open flame so you don\u2019t burn yourself.",
        "Submerge the bottle in ice water immediately after the yarn goes out.",
        "After about 30 seconds or when the flame on the yarn goes out, dip the bottle completely in a bowl full of ice water.",
        "The sudden change in temperature will cause the bottle to break where you wrapped it with yarn.",
        "Once the bottle breaks apart, pull it out of the water and let it dry.",
        "Be careful with the bottle after it breaks since the edges might be sharp.",
        "If the bottle doesn\u2019t break after the first time, soak another piece of yarn in acetone and repeat the process.",
        "Sand the broken edges with 220-grit sandpaper to remove any rough edges.",
        "Apply a gentle amount of pressure to the sandpaper around the edges of the bottle to smooth it out.",
        "Rotate the bottle while you sand it so you can get an even finish completely around the break.",
        "Keep working around the edge until there aren\u2019t any shards left on the bottle.",
        "If the edges are very uneven, you may not be able to sand them smooth."
