To test your soil's drainage, dig a hole that is 1 ft (30 cm) wide and 1 ft (30 cm) deep. Fill the hole with water. If the water drains in 10 minutes or less, you have well-draining soil. If it takes an hour or more, your soil drainage is poor. To amend soil that drains poorly, add some organic matter like well-rotted manure, wood chips, pea gravel, or peat moss.

        "Dividing Daylilies Divide daylily plants every 3 to 5 years after initially planting them.",
        "Dividing the plants will rejuvenate them and improve blooming.",
        "Since daylilies grow so vigorously, they will likely need the additional space to stay healthy, as well.",
        "Divide daylilies after they have bloomed, but prior to the first frost.",
        "Raise the whole daylily plant clump from the earth.",
        "Slice it into 6 to 8 sections (root divisions).",
        "Each root division should have several stems on the roots.",
        "Lop the foliage back 6 inches and remove any stems that look stunted or unhealthy.",
        "Only choose your healthiest daylilies for division.",
        "Cutting back the foliage helps the roots establish themselves more easily when replanted.",
        "Replant the root divisions 24 in (61 cm) to 36 in (91 cm) apart.",
        "Dig a 12 ft (370 cm) by 12 ft (370 cm) hole for each division.",
        "Put 1 division in each hole and refill the hole with soil.",
        "Make sure the crown is 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) below the ground line.",
        "Water the new transplants thoroughly.",
        "Make sure that the crown isn't too deep.",
        "Replanting that way can cause the crown to rot.",
        "The daylilies will grow and fill in the new space around them."
