Remove the insoles from your boots and whisk them through the soapy water, making sure each is washed and rinsed thoroughly. Wipe the inside and outside of the boots clean using a washcloth. Allow the boots to dry completely, or microorganisms will build back up due to the moisture. If your boots see a lot of use, you should aim to clean them every couple of weeks. Hang the boots or set them aside in a well-ventilated area until dry."

The baking soda will absorb and neutralize foot odors that have set into the material on the inside of the boots. Be sure to shake the excess baking soda out of your boots before wearing them.

Spray each boot thoroughly, inside and out. This won\u2019t do away with a powerful stench immediately, but it will work to kill the bacteria that are causing it. If you decide to use vinegar, it\u2019s recommended that you top it off with a spritz of air freshener or a drop of essential oils to offset the smell, which can be unpleasant on its own."

Continue cleaning and disinfecting your boots consistently, and freshen them with essential oils in the meantime. Essential oils are natural fragrant botanical extracts that are wonderful for covering up offensive smells. Just dab a few drops of rosemary, peppermint or tea tree oil into your boots at night, store them somewhere dry and let the oils do the rest. Because of their pleasant aroma and antimicrobial properties, essential oils are commonly used as a holistic alternative to deodorant, hand soap and even perfume."

You can reduce the amount of perspiration that is being absorbed by the fabric of your footwear by dusting your feet with a light coating of baby powder or talcum powder before putting on your socks. Sprinkle baby powder onto the bottom of your feet and between your toes. Massage lightly to work it nearer to the skin. The talc will absorb and dissipate moisture and thus prevent smells, and should disappear on its own over time so that it doesn\u2019t cake onto your foot.

While you\u2019re at it, be on the lookout for signs of fungal infection, such as a slight darkening of the skin or discoloration of the toenail. Maintaining clean, neat toenails gives germs fewer places to hide. Toenails should be clipped straight across and kept fairly short. Try to trim your toenails once a week to prevent them from growing too long. Athlete\u2019s foot and other fungal infections are persistent, and, unlike normal bacteria that grows on the skin\u2019s surface, cannot simply be washed away."
