                    "description": "Fat is essential to a moist and flavorful beef joint. You want to buy a beef joint that has a thick layer of fat on it. The fat will melt during the cooking process, infusing your beef joint with moisture and lots of flavor. If your beef joint does not have a layer of fat on top, which is likely with a joint of silverside, ask the butcher to secure fat to the meat. Like beef fat, beef bones will also impart rich flavor to your meat. If you purchase a boneless beef joint from a butcher, you can ask for beef bones to tuck under the beef joint when cooking."

It\u2019s a lean cut of meat, which means it doesn\u2019t have much fat inside; but it does have a layer of fat on one side that melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist.

To keep this from happening to your silverside, it needs to be braised in liquid. You can also have it \u201cbarded,\u201d if buying from a butcher, which means thin layers of beef fat are placed on top of the silverside to keep it moist while cooking."

If your beef joint is a leaner cut, like topside or silverside, rub it with olive oil before seasoning.

If you\u2019re roasting your beef joint and prefer to let the taste of the beef shine, simply cut a small onion in half to tuck under the meat. For an added depth of flavor, wash and chop 2 medium onions, 2 carrots, 2 sticks of celery, and a small bunch of herbs, such as fresh thyme, rosemary, bay or sage.

    "text": " Choosing Your Beef Joint Buy your beef joint according to how you want to cook it. Tender cuts of meat, like sirloin and fore rib, are better for roasting, while leaner cuts of meat, like topside and silverside, are better for braising. Pick out a fresh cut of beef. When purchasing beef, make sure the meat is a deep, dark red. Look for beef containing little streaks of fat throughout leaner muscle, and with an outside layer of firm, creamy-white fat. It should also be slightly sticky with a little resistance when pressed. Make sure your beef joint has enough fat. Fat is essential to a moist and flavorful beef joint. You want to buy a beef joint that has a thick layer of fat on it. The fat will melt during the cooking process, infusing your beef joint with moisture and lots of flavor.

If you\u2019d prefer your sirloin boneless, look for a striploin, rolled sirloin, or rolled sirloin with undercut. Prepping Your Beef Joint Take out enough beef for the amount of people you\u2019ll be serving. Take your beef joint out of the refrigerator thirty minutes before cooking.

As the meat relaxes, it will reabsorb its juices, ensuring your meat is juicy and full of flavor when served. Braising Beef Joint Preheat your oven to 320 \u00b0F (160 \u00b0C) and warm your casserole pot. While your beef joint reaches room temperature, set your oven to the appropriate temperature. Take out a large casserole pot and warm it over medium high heat. Brown your beef joint on all sides. When the meat is room temperature and your large casserole pot is hot, add a teaspoon of oil to the pot and brown your beef joint for about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove it from the pot once all sides are browned. Sautee your vegetables. Add the chopped onions to the pot and allow them to cook for 2-3 minutes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to draw out the onion\u2019s juices, and stir to keep the onions from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Then add the rest of your vegetables, garlic and herbs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let the vegetables cook for 4-5 minutes. Add broth. Add 3 cups of either chicken or beef broth to the pot and stir. Taste the liquid to see if it needs additional salt and pepper. You\u2019ll want to make sure your broth has enough salt because without it your roast will lose flavor. The broth will keep your beef joint moist while cooking. Place your beef joint on top of the vegetables. To ensure your meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness, insert a meat thermometer directly into the center. Don\u2019t let the thermometer touch bone. Then cover with a top. Put the covered casserole pot in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes reduce the oven heat to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C), and set a timer to allow the beef joint to cook for an hour and a half. When your beef joint is 5 degrees away from the desired temperature of doneness, remove it from the oven. Check your thermometer to see if your beef joint is close to the temperature of your desired level of doneness. For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125\u00b0F. For medium rare, 130 to 135\u00b0F. For medium, 140 to 145\u00b0F. For medium well, 150 to 155\u00b0F. And for well done, 160\u00b0F and up. Let it rest.

        "It\u2019s ideal for roasting, but also cooks well braised as a pot roast, and in stews, casseroles and pies.",
        "Choose a joint of silverside for a midweek pot roast.",
        "It\u2019s similar to the topside, except leaner.",
        "It\u2019s more affordable than other cuts of meat; however, cheaper cuts of meat are not as tender once cooked.",
        "To keep this from happening to your silverside, it needs to be braised in liquid.",
        "You can also have it \u201cbarded,\u201d if buying from a butcher, which means thin layers of beef fat are placed on top of the silverside to keep it moist while cooking.",
        "Choose rib of beef, also known as fore rib, for a special occasion, like a holiday party.",
        "It can easily be split into rib-eye steaks after cooking to serve several people.",
        "It\u2019s great for roasting on the bone, which imparts great flavor; and it has a thick layer of fat to keep it moist while cooking.",
        "Choose sirloin to impress a crowd.",
        "It is just as tender as rib of beef, but leaner and costlier.",
        "Bone-in sirloin will impart more flavor, so look for a sirloin joint on the bone, or sirloin with undercut, which is the same as the sirloin joint, but with the tender fillet attached.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer your sirloin boneless, look for a striploin, rolled sirloin, or rolled sirloin with undercut.",
        "Prepping Your Beef Joint Take out enough beef for the amount of people you\u2019ll be serving.",
        "Take your beef joint out of the refrigerator thirty minutes before cooking.",
        "It needs to be room temperature before cooking in order to cook evenly.",
        "A general consensus for the amount of beef you should prepare to make sure you have enough (and even some leftovers) is about 5-6lbs per 6-8 people.",
        "Season your beef joint.",
        "Season your beef joint simply with salt and pepper.",
        "Don\u2019t season with too much salt because salt can draw out the juices and dry out your meat.",
        "If your beef joint is a leaner cut, like topside or silverside, rub it with olive oil before seasoning.",
        "If it already has a layer of fat on top, you don\u2019t need to drizzle it with olive oil at all.",
        "Some people remove the layer of fat after roasting.",
        "But if you like the taste of beef fat, and plan on eating it, sprinkle it with a teaspoon each of English mustard powder and plain flour.",
        "This will give it a nice crispy texture.",
        "Wash and chop vegetables to cook along with the beef joint.",
        "The amount of vegetables you add to your dish depends on taste preferences.",
        "For roasting, adding an assortment of vegetables is optional.",
        "But they should be included when braising, since the vegetables will lend additional flavor to your beef joint during the slow cooking process.",
        "If you\u2019re roasting your beef joint and prefer to let the taste of the beef shine, simply cut a small onion in half to tuck under the meat.",
        "For an added depth of flavor, wash and chop 2 medium onions, 2 carrots, 2 sticks of celery, and a small bunch of herbs, such as fresh thyme, rosemary, bay or sage.",
        "Break apart 1 bulb of garlic into cloves.",
        "Don\u2019t worry about peeling them.",
        "You\u2019ll place the vegetables in the bottom of your cooking dish, and then sit the beef joint on top.",
        "Roasting Beef Joint Preheat your oven to 475 \u00b0F (246 \u00b0C) and continue allowing your beef joint to warm to room temperature.",
        "Set your oven to the appropriate temperature while your meat reaches room temperature.",
        "Use this time to also prep your roasting pan and find a timer.",
        "Place your chopped veggies in the bottom of a roasting pan and top with the beef joint.",
        "Fill the bottom of a roasting pan with either one small onion cut in half, or an assortment of chopped vegetables, garlic and herbs.",
        "If you do the assorted vegetables and herbs, drizzle them with olive oil.",
        "Then set the beef joint (fat side up) on top.",
        "Insert a meat thermometer into your beef joint, and then place the pan of beef in the oven.",
        "Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer into the middle of your beef joint, making sure the thermometer is not touching bone.",
        "Set the pan of beef in the oven just above the center, and allow it to cook at the initial temperature of 475\u00b0F.",
        "Set your timer for 20 minutes.",
        "When your timer goes off, turn down the temperature of the oven to 375\u00b0F.",
        "Watch your meat thermometer to determine when your beef joint is done.",
        "The temperature it reaches and the amount of time you let it cook depends on how well done you prefer your meat.",
        "If you\u2019d prefer your meat rare, with a bright red center, allow it to continue roasting for an additional 20 minutes per pound.",
        "Add an additional 15 minutes for medium rare, or an additional 30 minutes for well-done, to the total cooking time calculated for a rare roast.",
        "For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125\u00b0F.",
        "For medium rare it must reach 130 to 135\u00b0F.",
        "For medium, 140 to 145\u00b0F.",
        "For medium well, 150 to 155\u00b0F.",
        "For well done, 160\u00b0F and up.",
        "Because the temperature of meat can rise 5 to 10 degrees during rest time, take it out of the oven 5 degrees before it reaches the desired temperature of doneness.",
        "Baste the meat throughout cooking to keep your beef joint infused with flavor.",
        "At least three times during the cooking process take the meat out of the oven to baste.",
        "Make sure to close the oven door each time you do so to keep the oven hot.",
        "To baste the beef joint use a baster, which is a large plastic suction, to suck up the juices of the beef.",
        "Carefully squirt the hot liquid all over the beef.",
        "If you don\u2019t have a baster, you can use a large spoon.",
        "You may have to tip the roasting pan a little to scoop up the juices.",
        "When your beef joint has reached the desired temperature, take it out of the oven and allow it to rest.",
        "Lightly cover your roasted beef with foil paper and let it rest for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour before serving.",
        "As the meat relaxes, it will reabsorb its juices, ensuring your meat is juicy and full of flavor when served.",
        "Braising Beef Joint Preheat your oven to 320 \u00b0F (160 \u00b0C) and warm your casserole pot.",
        "While your beef joint reaches room temperature, set your oven to the appropriate temperature.",
        "Take out a large casserole pot and warm it over medium high heat.",
        "Brown your beef joint on all sides.",
        "When the meat is room temperature and your large casserole pot is hot, add a teaspoon of oil to the pot and brown your beef joint for about 3 to 4 minutes per side.",
        "Remove it from the pot once all sides are browned.",
        "Sautee your vegetables.",
        "Add the chopped onions to the pot and allow them to cook for 2-3 minutes.",
        "Sprinkle with salt and pepper to draw out the onion\u2019s juices, and stir to keep the onions from sticking to the bottom of the pan.",
        "Then add the rest of your vegetables, garlic and herbs.",
        "Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let the vegetables cook for 4-5 minutes.",
        "Add broth.",
        "Add 3 cups of either chicken or beef broth to the pot and stir.",
        "Taste the liquid to see if it needs additional salt and pepper.",
        "You\u2019ll want to make sure your broth has enough salt because without it your roast will lose flavor.",
        "The broth will keep your beef joint moist while cooking.",
        "Place your beef joint on top of the vegetables.",
        "To ensure your meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness, insert a meat thermometer directly into the center.",
        "Don\u2019t let the thermometer touch bone.",
        "Then cover with a top.",
        "Put the covered casserole pot in the oven and set a timer for 30 minutes.",
        "After 30 minutes reduce the oven heat to 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C), and set a timer to allow the beef joint to cook for an hour and a half.",
        "When your beef joint is 5 degrees away from the desired temperature of doneness, remove it from the oven.",
        "Check your thermometer to see if your beef joint is close to the temperature of your desired level of doneness.",
        "For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125\u00b0F.",
