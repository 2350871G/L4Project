                    "description": "Getting the right kayak is a big part of fishing successfully. The exact size of kayak you need will depend on your height and weight, but generally, short, wide kayaks are the easiest to control. Look for a kayak with a seat on top as well as additional features like extra storage space and cleats to tie down your gear. Speak with a salesperson at an outdoor sporting goods store to find a kayak that suits you. Sturdiness is important, especially for taller people. A wide-bottomed kayak may also allow you to stand up while on the water. Spend a little extra to get a kayak with additional features like a good seat, a rod holder, and storage space. One good feature to look for is an oar holster so you can set the paddle down without losing it while you're wrangling fish."

                    "description": "If your kayak doesn't include a raised seat, purchase one. Fit it against the back of the kayak's seat rest, then look for attachment points on the kayak. The seat will probably have at least one metal clip meant to attach to a cleat near the back of the kayak. After securing the seat, open it so it stays upright. A comfortable seat helps a lot with staying comfortable during a long day, but it also makes fishing easier. It elevates you so you can look down at the water and also throw the line further away from the kayak. Getting a separate seat is useful if you have a sit-inside kayak. \u201cSit-on-top\u201d kayaks already have an elevated seat."

Pick an affordable rod that is easy to set up and cast while you're sitting inside the kayak. Try using a lightweight carbon fiber rod that is about \u00bd the length of the kayak. Pair it with a matching reel made of a lightweight material like carbon or magnesium. Lightweight rods and reels are better for kayak fishing since they require less energy to cast. When choosing a rod, test it out while you're sitting down. Casting a long distance takes more arm strength when you're sitting. Keep in mind that the rod and reel will get wet even if your kayak doesn't flip over. Consider getting a detachable rod that breaks apart into several pieces. That way, you can put it together when you need it and take it apart when you're done fishing."

You will also need a nylon anchoring rope to knot the anchor to your kayak. A good starting length for the rope is 75 ft (23 m), although you may need to attach the anchor at a different length depending on how deep the water  is. Lighter anchors work well in most situations, but opt for a heavier anchor if you plan on kayaking into rough waters. Many kayaks have a cleat hitch for you to tie the anchor to. If yours doesn't have a hitch, you can buy one and quickly install it using the included metal tabs and screws. Some kayaks also have holes in them for anchoring. To use the hole, stick a long stake-out pole through the hole and into the mud. You could also tie the pole to the side of the kayak to stop yourself from drifting."

Add additional layers if you plan on going fishing in cooler weather. For spring and fall fishing, many kayakers put on a dry suit or flexible waders. You can also get a full-body dry suit for winter. Pair these garments with a warm shirt and waterproof jacket. Bring a lightweight waterproof jacket for dealing with splashes or rain. Consider also bringing a warm hat and gloves during cold periods. If you fish during the summer, many people stick to bathing suits, shorts, and short-sleeved T-shirts. If you dress this way, be aware of sun exposure by wearing a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen."

Once you notice a school of fish or a good spot where they are likely to gather, start paddling toward them. Use short, gentle strokes to avoid splashing. Try to sweep the paddle close to the boat. Loud noises scare away fish, so do your best to be as silent as possible. It will give you an advantage that you wouldn't get from a boat with a loud motor. Hitting the kayak is a sure way to scare off fish. To avoid this, move your paddle slowly and with caution. Take your time when positioning the kayak."

Wait for it to hit the bottom. Then, wait for your kayak to settle before casting your line. Use an anchor hitch to secure the anchor. Remember to pull open the anchor's prongs before throwing it into the water. When the anchor hits the floor, it turns sideways so the prongs catch on solid ground. The kayak will drift in the direction of the water current or wind, so factor in the drift when choosing where to stop."

Then, hold the rod horizontally again in front of you as you wait for fish to bite. Barbed hooks can get stuck on your kayak or worse, someone or something else. A stuck hook is difficult to remove without going back to shore or cutting the line. If you are able to stand up in the kayak, you can create more room to maneuver the rod. It's also good for leveraging fish out of the water."

Keep reeling, lowering the rod down as needed to reduce the tension. Stay still, centered in the boat while you try to bring the fish in. If you lean to the side, you may end up in the water."

If your aim is on point, the fish will be securely in the net. Make sure it's stuck in there before trying to lift it out of the water. Bring the fish close enough to the boat so you don't have to lean out to catch it. Leaning too far is a sure way to end up wet, and then you may lose the fish on top of that! You could also pull the rod back to flip the fish up in a single, quick motion. It's difficult to do when you're new to fishing and can also lead to a sharp hook flying through the air, so try it with caution."

Slowly pull it out of the fish's mouth. When you're done, store the fish or release it. Another option is to buy hooks without barbs. If you have barbed hooks, you could also crimp them by using pliers to crush the barbs. Without the barbs, the hooks become much easier to slide off the fish."

One of the biggest advantages of kayak fishing is stealth. Once you notice a school of fish or a good spot where they are likely to gather, start paddling toward them. Use short, gentle strokes to avoid splashing. Try to sweep the paddle close to the boat. Loud noises scare away fish, so do your best to be as silent as possible. It will give you an advantage that you wouldn't get from a boat with a loud motor. Hitting the kayak is a sure way to scare off fish. To avoid this, move your paddle slowly and with caution. Take your time when positioning the kayak. Cast the anchor by dropping it into the water while holding the line. Make sure the nylon anchoring rope is firmly knotted to both the anchor and your kayak. Then, maintain your grip on the rope while the anchor slowly sinks. Wait for it to hit the bottom. Then, wait for your kayak to settle before casting your line. Use an anchor hitch to secure the anchor. Remember to pull open the anchor's prongs before throwing it into the water. When the anchor hits the floor, it turns sideways so the prongs catch on solid ground. The kayak will drift in the direction of the water current or wind, so factor in the drift when choosing where to stop. Sit up straight while moving your arm back to cast the line. Keep the rod positioned horizontally in front of you, then draw it back quickly. Once the hook goes behind your head, snap the rod forward to fling the line ahead of you. You don't have much space, so don't let the hook go back far enough to hit the kayak. Then, hold the rod horizontally again in front of you as you wait for fish to bite. Barbed hooks can get stuck on your kayak or worse, someone or something else. A stuck hook is difficult to remove without going back to shore or cutting the line. If you are able to stand up in the kayak, you can create more room to maneuver the rod. It's also good for leveraging fish out of the water. Reel the rod back in when you feel a fish on the hook. Hold the rod up, almost vertically, to pull the fish in with more force. Make sure you leave some slack in the line. If it looks or feels tense, it may snap. Keep reeling, lowering the rod down as needed to reduce the tension. Stay still, centered in the boat while you try to bring the fish in. If you lean to the side, you may end up in the water. Catch the fish with a landing net once it gets close to the kayak. Keep reeling in the fish until it's right up next to your boat. Switch to your net, then sweep it horizontally through the water. If your aim is on point, the fish will be securely in the net. Make sure it's stuck in there before trying to lift it out of the water. Bring the fish close enough to the boat so you don't have to lean out to catch it. Leaning too far is a sure way to end up wet, and then you may lose the fish on top of that! You could also pull the rod back to flip the fish up in a single, quick motion. It's difficult to do when you're new to fishing and can also lead to a sharp hook flying through the air, so try it with caution. Pull the hook out of the fish before storing it in ice. Have a small pair of pliers on hand to help unhook the fish without hurting it. Reach into the fish's mouth, then rotate the hook until it points toward you. Slowly pull it out of the fish's mouth. When you're done, store the fish or release it. Another option is to buy hooks without barbs. If you have barbed hooks, you could also crimp them by using pliers to crush the barbs. Without the barbs, the hooks become much easier to slide off the fish.",
