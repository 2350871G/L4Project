An average size backyard pool can take around 14 hours to drain, but this can vary significantly based on the pump you use and the specific size of your pool. There may be regulations on disposing of drained pool water where you live. Check with your local government. If you\u2019re painting a brand-new, never-filled pool, skip ahead to the section of this article on priming and painting.

However, this is a very corrosive acid that produces dangerous fumes, so detailed safety measures must be followed closely. Skip this step if you\u2019re not fully confident in your ability to use muriatic acid safely. Muriatic acid is available at home centers. You must wear acid-resistant gloves, safety goggles, and a full respirator (not a dust mask), among other safety measures, when using muriatic acid. Observe an experienced person using muriatic acid safely before attempting to use it yourself. Once again, skip this step if you\u2019re unsure of your ability. The paint will still adhere, but it may flake off and require repainting more quickly\u2014perhaps in 1-2 years instead of 2-3. If you do a muriatic acid rinse, you\u2019ll need to follow up with a clean water rinse and another cleaning with TSP.

        "Suck up the water and debris with a wet-dry vacuum.",
        "You can, if desired, power wash the pool before patching any cracks or holes.",
        "Doing so may loosen more material around existing cracks.",
        "Scrub down the pool with trisodium phosphate (TSP).",
        "Put on sturdy cleaning gloves and protective eyewear.",
        "Add 1 US gal (3.8 L) of hot water to a large bucket, then stir in 0.5 c (120 g) of TSP with a long stirring stick.",
        "Dip a long-handled, stiff-bristled brush into the mixture, then scrub down the entire pool surface.",
        "When you\u2019re done scrubbing, rinse away the TSP with a garden hose, then suck up the dirty puddle in the bottom of the pool with a wet-dry vacuum.",
        "TSP comes in the form of white granules that dissolve in water to create an alkaline cleaning solution.",
        "Do a muriatic acid rinse only if you have the skills and safety gear.",
        "Spraying the pool surfaces with muriatic acid helps to complete the cleaning process, as well as etch the surfaces so that they accept paint better.",
        "However, this is a very corrosive acid that produces dangerous fumes, so detailed safety measures must be followed closely.",
        "Skip this step if you\u2019re not fully confident in your ability to use muriatic acid safely.",
        "Muriatic acid is available at home centers.",
        "You must wear acid-resistant gloves, safety goggles, and a full respirator (not a dust mask), among other safety measures, when using muriatic acid.",
        "Observe an experienced person using muriatic acid safely before attempting to use it yourself.",
        "Once again, skip this step if you\u2019re unsure of your ability.",
        "The paint will still adhere, but it may flake off and require repainting more quickly\u2014perhaps in 1-2 years instead of 2-3.",
        "If you do a muriatic acid rinse, you\u2019ll need to follow up with a clean water rinse and another cleaning with TSP.",
        "Additionally, you must buy an acid neutralizer along with the muriatic acid so you can safely dispose of the material that will collect in the bottom of your pool.",
        "Give the pool a final rinse, drain, and dry.",
        "No matter how many different times and ways you\u2019ve cleaned the pool surfaces, go over them one last time with clean water from a hose.",
        "Use a wet-dry vacuum to suck up puddled water, then sop up any remainder with towels.",
        "Then, leave the empty pool to air dry.",
        "If you\u2019ll be using acrylic paint, you only need to make sure there are no puddles of water remaining.",
        "However, if you\u2019re using epoxy or rubber paint, the pool surfaces must be absolutely dry.",
        "If you tape a sheet of plastic wrap to the surface and any water droplets form on the underside of the plastic within 60 minutes, the surface is still too wet to paint.",
        "Applying Acrylic Pool Paint Choose an acrylic pool paint as the easiest DIY choice.",
        "Acrylic pool paint is not the longest lasting choice\u2014you can expect to get 2-3 years out of it, whereas rubber paint often gets 2-4 years and epoxy paint regularly gets 5-7 years.",
        "That said, it is by far the easiest choice for the average DIYer, especially if you\u2019re repainting a pool.",
        "Acrylic pool paint can be painted over any previous type of pool paint, so long as any loose or chipped paint is removed.",
        "Rubber must be painted over rubber and epoxy over epoxy, or the surface must be sandblasted bare.",
        "Acrylic pool paint, unlike rubber or epoxy, can be used on damp surfaces, so long as there isn\u2019t any standing water.",
        "Acrylic pool paint can be purchased at pool supply stores as well as home improvement stores.",
        "Apply an acrylic pool primer to any patched or bare areas.",
        "Brush on a coat of primer over any areas that aren\u2019t covered by prior coats of paint.",
        "Treat it like any typical primer or paint\u2014open the can, stir the contents thoroughly, and use smooth brush strokes to apply an even coat of primer where it\u2019s needed.",
        "If you have larger areas to cover with primer, pour it into a pan and use a roller with a telescoping handle and a low-nap roller pad\u2014that is, 0.375 in (9.5 mm) nap length or less.",
        "Let the primer dry for at least 2-3 hours before proceeding.",
        "If you don't prime bare areas, your paint may not adhere properly.",
        "You can buy acrylic pool primer wherever you buy acrylic pool paint.",
        "Rubber and epoxy pool primers can be applied in the same fashion, but tend to be thicker than acrylic primer.",
        "Roll on a coat of paint, starting from the pool\u2019s deep end.",
        "Pour 4 cans of paint, each 1 US gal (3.8 L) in volume, into a 5 US gal (19 L) bucket and stir it thoroughly with a long stirring stick.",
        "As with the primer, use a paint pan and a roller with a telescoping handle and a low-nap roller pad.",
        "Acrylic pool paint rolls on like typical house paint.",
        "Use the roller pan to work a small amount of paint into the roller pad, then apply the paint with smooth, even strokes.",
        "Use a paintbrush for corners and tight spaces.",
        "Start at the deep end of the pool and work your way to the shallowest part\u2014otherwise, you\u2019ll paint yourself into the deep end!",
        "You\u2019ll likely need around 7\u20138 US gal (26\u201330 L) of acrylic pool paint to apply 2 coats to a 16 ft \u00d7 32 ft (4.9 m \u00d7 9.8 m) pool.",
        "Rubber and epoxy pool paints are usually thicker, but can still be applied with rollers and brushes.",
        "The amount you need may vary versus acrylic, so check the product instructions.",
        "Apply a second coat after waiting 2-3 hours.",
        "Acrylic pool paints usually dry to the touch within 3 hours, but check the product instructions for the proper waiting time.",
        "The first coat should no longer be tacky when you begin to apply the second coat.",
        "Add the second coat in the same manner as the first.",
        "2 coats of acrylic paint is usually sufficient.",
        "However, you may need to add 1 or more additional coats if you\u2019re covering a darker color with a lighter color.",
        "Drying times are similar among acrylic, rubber, and epoxy pool paints.",
        "If you\u2019re using rubber or epoxy, follow the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations regarding the number of coats to apply.",
        "Let the paint cure for 3-7 days before filling the pool.",
        "Acrylic pool paint is more forgiving if it happens to rain after application, but ideally it should get at least 3 days to cure before being exposed to moisture.",
        "Sop up any rainwater that does collect in the pool during this time.",
        "Acrylic, rubber, and especially epoxy pool paints work best if allowed to cure for 7 days.",
        "For rubber and epoxy, though, add 1 curing day for any day during the period when it rains.",
        "After the curing time is complete, your pool is ready to refill, treat, maintain, and enjoy!"
