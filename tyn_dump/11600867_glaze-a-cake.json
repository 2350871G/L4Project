        "Let the glaze cool for about 10 minutes or until it's between 90 and 95 \u00b0F (32 and 35 \u00b0C).",
        "If your glaze cools too much and the temperature falls below 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C), microwave the glaze in 10-second intervals until it's up to temperature.",

        "Remove the chilled cake from the fridge and set it on a wire rack.",
        "Lift the rack up and set it down on a rimmed baking sheet.",

        "You can use heavy cream or whipping cream for the chocolate glaze.",
        "Warm the cream and sugar over medium heat until it bubbles.",
        "Stir the mixture occasionally until it begins to bubble just a little around the edges of the pan.",
        "You might need to adjust the burner so the cream doesn't begin to boil.",
        "Heat the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved.",
        "Pour the hot cream over the chocolate.",
        "Turn off the burner and wear oven mitts as you slowly pour the cream into the bowl with the chopped chocolate.",
        "It's important to pour the cream over the chocolate while it's hot so the heat from the cream can melt the chocolate.",
        "Rest the mixture for 5 minutes before you whisk it.",
        "If you stir the chocolate and cream before the chocolate melts, it will become slightly lumpy.",
        "Instead, wait a full 5 minutes before whisking.",
        "If you don't have a whisk, you can use a spoon to stir the glaze.",

        "To make clean-up easier, put the wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet.",
        "Then, set a completely cooled cake on the rack.",
        "Avoid using a cake that's still warm from the oven or it will absorb the glaze.",
        "To glaze cupcakes, arrange them on the wire rack so they're almost touching.",
        "Ladle the glaze over the center of the cake.",
        "Dip a ladle into the glaze and pour it onto the middle of the cake.",
        "Keep pouring so the glaze spills over the sides of the cake.",
        "If the chocolate glaze isn't spreading evenly, you can use the bottom of the ladle or the back of a spoon to push the glaze over the sides of the cake.",
        "If you don't want to use a ladle, slowly pour the chocolate glaze onto the cake.",
        "The chocolate glaze will thicken as it sits, so work quickly.",
