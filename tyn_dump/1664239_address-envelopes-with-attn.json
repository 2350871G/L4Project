Use a colon after \"Attn\" to make it clearly readable. This line signifies to the mail carrier exactly for whom the letter is intended. For example, write \"Attn: John Smith,\" where \"John Smith\" is replaced with your recipient's name. As an alternative, you can write out the full word \"attention.\""

If the company is large and the person to whom you're writing works for a particular department, include the department name on a line of it's own before you write the company name. Not including the company name on the envelope will not usually prevent your letter from being delivered. However, your letter will look less professional, and may not get delivered promptly if you don't include the company name."
