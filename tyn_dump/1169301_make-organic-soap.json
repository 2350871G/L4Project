        "The essential oils will smell stronger when added to the batter than when the batter is cured.",
        "So if the scent is not strong in the batter, add more in small increments until you can smell it.Some common essential oils to add are vanilla, almond, lavender, lemongrass, geranium, or peppermint.",
        "Molding and Curing the Soap Pour the batter into a 4 in (10 cm) silicone soap mold to shape it.",
        "Use a mold that will create 4 rectangular bars of soap.",
        "A standard mold will have an approximate 4 by 4 in (10 by 10 cm) length and width, and 3 in (7.6 cm) height.",
        "You can find one of these molds at a local craft store or online with major retailers.Consider getting a silicone mold that has a fun pattern or design on it to further personalize your homemade soap.",
        "You can also use a loaf mold that is not sectioned off and just cut the soap into individual bars later.",
        "Avoid using muffin tins or baking pans as the soap batter will most likely ruin the tins and the soap.",
        "Cover the filled mold with freezer paper and a towel to trap the heat.",
        "Leave the soap covered for at least 24 hours, but check on it periodically to make sure that it is not overheating and cracking.",
        "If it develops cracks, leave it covered, but move it to a cooler location like a dark closet or a cool basement.Use freezer paper over standard wax paper, as freezer paper is thicker and the wax paper might melt against the heat of the soap batter.",
        "You can also use parchment paper.",
        "Uncover the mold and leave it to firm up over the next 2-3 days.",
        "Check on the soap at least once a day to make sure that it\u2019s hardening properly and has not been disturbed.",
        "You will notice that the texture of the soap batter will gradually change to a gelatinous state over the 3 days.",
        "By the third day, it should seem fairly firm if you touch it with your finger.",
        "Pop the soap bars out of the silicone mold to cure them.",
        "Place the bars in an area out of direct sunlight, and leave them alone for at least 6-8 weeks.",
        "The air will dry out and fully harden the soap.",
        "After that time, the soap will be ready for you to use and enjoy!Soaps that use a higher ratio of water to olive oil will only need to be cured for 4-6 weeks instead.",
        "If you used a loaf silicone mold, use a knife to carefully cut the loaf of soap into 4 equally sized bars before curing them."
