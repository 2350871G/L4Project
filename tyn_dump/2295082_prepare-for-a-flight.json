Contact your bank first to inform them that you're traveling and find out if your plastic is good there. Be wary of high ATM fees when you travel.

For example, if you plan on taking an 11-day vacation, pack enough clothing for 11 outfits. Consider slipping a set into your carry-on bag so you have it in case anything happens to your luggage.

Even though liquids are restricted on planes these days, you are allowed to bring small containers with you. Stow them all inside a 1 US quart (950 mL) plastic bag so they aren't rattling around inside your luggage. Consider adding important supplies to your carry-on. For example, deodorant and toothpaste are handy to have available on a lengthy flight. Any bottle over 3.4 fluid ounces (100 mL) in size has to be in your checked luggage.

The average maximum dimensions for a carry-on bag is 22 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 9 in (56 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 23 cm).

Talk to your doctor about any special preparations you need to make. Also, bring a doctor's note and instructions for using your medication. Keep your medication in its original container labeled with your name and the dosage. Don't leave medication loose in your bag or a pill organizer since that makes it more difficult for security to identify what you're carrying.

Bring along alternatives like books, games, a tablet, or a laptop. Remember to bring charging cables for your electronics and keep them safely stowed away inside your carry-on. The best entertainment device to bring is a tablet since you can load all sorts of apps on it. Load it up with plenty of books, movies, music, and games. It takes up way less space than alternative forms of entertainment. Try to plan out how you intend on filling the time. Set aside a couple of hours to watch a movie, for instance. If you're on a long trip, estimate the remaining flight time you have left to fill and pack accordingly."

Many airlines these days don't serve much in the way of complimentary food, so have some snacks in reserve to stay comfortable during the flight. On the plus side, it will also help you avoid expensive airport food! Check the airline and travel security rules to plan what you are bringing. You will be surprised at what you're allowed to bring. They let you bring just about anything, but solid, lightweight snacks like fruit, chips, and cereal are best. You can't really bring drinks past security. What you can do, however, is bring an empty bottle with you and fill it up before you get onto the plane. Alternatively, buy a drink at the airport after clearing security."

Get a travel pillow to stay comfortable when you're stuck in those rough seats for a while, particularly for overnight trips. Your comfort is worth the extra packing. Airlines generally let you take a personal item onto the plane along with your carry-on. Blankets and pillows are great choices if you can't fit them into your bag. Noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs are also good to bring if you plan on sleeping on the plane, though they're also good for some peace and quiet while you're awake."

To avoid leaving important things at home, make a list of everything you need. Pack in advance so you don't end up hoping you fit everything in at the last minute. Look up a list of what is illegal to bring on planes. This will make the check-in process much easier.

Security checkpoints are always in the same area as the airline check-in counters in the opposite direction of the entrance doors. Also, look for screens and signs posted on the walls with information about where your plane is. This information may also be printed on your boarding pass. If you check in online or through an airline app, you do not need to visit the airline counter. Instead, head toward security.

The average maximum dimensions for a carry-on bag is 22 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 9 in (56 \u00d7 36 \u00d7 23 cm). Keep in mind that if your carry-on bag is too big, you will be asked to check it in at the airline's counter before you're allowed through security. That means you have to pay any fees that come along with checked bags, too. Pack a supply of medications you need for your trip. Band-aids and aspirin are great to have around, but it's prescription medication you have to plan for. Keep in mind what you need and bring enough of it. Talk to your doctor about any special preparations you need to make. Also, bring a doctor's note and instructions for using your medication. Keep your medication in its original container labeled with your name and the dosage. Don't leave medication loose in your bag or a pill organizer since that makes it more difficult for security to identify what you're carrying. Consider bringing along information about serious conditions like allergies. You could get a medical alert bracelet to wear. That way, you can get better treatment in case something goes wrong. Bring plenty of entertainment to keep you busy during the flight. Entertainment is especially useful for longer flights. Many airlines play movies on a flight, so consider packing a pair of headphones to tune in. Bring along alternatives like books, games, a tablet, or a laptop. Remember to bring charging cables for your electronics and keep them safely stowed away inside your carry-on. The best entertainment device to bring is a tablet since you can load all sorts of apps on it. Load it up with plenty of books, movies, music, and games. It takes up way less space than alternative forms of entertainment. Try to plan out how you intend on filling the time. Set aside a couple of hours to watch a movie, for instance. If you're on a long trip, estimate the remaining flight time you have left to fill and pack accordingly. Take some snacks in case you get hungry during your trip. No one wants to survive off of airline peanuts, so pack solid foods like granola bars. Bring things that won't spoil and won't cause a mess when you try to eat them. Many airlines these days don't serve much in the way of complimentary food, so have some snacks in reserve to stay comfortable during the flight. On the plus side, it will also help you avoid expensive airport food! Check the airline and travel security rules to plan what you are bringing. You will be surprised at what you're allowed to bring. They let you bring just about anything, but solid, lightweight snacks like fruit, chips, and cereal are best. You can't really bring drinks past security. What you can do, however, is bring an empty bottle with you and fill it up before you get onto the plane. Alternatively, buy a drink at the airport after clearing security. Bring a blanket and travel pillow if you think you need it on the plane. Most airlines no longer give out pillows and blankets to use on the plane. Plane compartments get a little cold, so dress warmly or bring a small blanket. Get a travel pillow to stay comfortable when you're stuck in those rough seats for a while, particularly for overnight trips. Your comfort is worth the extra packing. Airlines generally let you take a personal item onto the plane along with your carry-on. Blankets and pillows are great choices if you can't fit them into your bag. Noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs are also good to bring if you plan on sleeping on the plane, though they're also good for some peace and quiet while you're awake. Heading to the Airport Do a quick inspection of your bags to make sure you have everything you need. Every traveler is familiar with the, \u201cI forgot this very important item at home!\u201d dilemma. Look over both your luggage and your carry-on, making sure everything is in its place. Also, look for anything that might cause you trouble as you attempt to reach your flight. To avoid leaving important things at home, make a list of everything you need. Pack in advance so you don't end up hoping you fit everything in at the last minute. Look up a list of what is illegal to bring on planes. This will make the check-in process much easier. Security can force you to throw away things like big bottles of liquids, so make sure those items are in your luggage if you intend on bringing them. Find a way to get to and from the airport. The easiest way to do this is to have someone drop you off and then pick you up at your destination. That way, you can throw your luggage in and be on your way. Arrange for your ride in advance. Plan out your route so you know how long it takes to get there. If you're a driver, airports have places where you can leave your car. It gets pricey, so read up about the fees first. Public transportation is an option sometimes if you don't mind hauling your luggage yourself. Otherwise, call a driving service in advance so you have plenty of time to get to the airport. Arrive at the airport at least 2 hours in advance. This is the timeframe recommended by airlines and airport security. It gives you plenty of time to get your boarding pass, check your bags, and pass through security. Many airlines cut off check-in 30 to 60 minutes ahead of the departure time for security reasons, so don't risk being late! If you check in and print your boarding pass out in advance, you may be able to save some time. Keep in mind that you can't control the wait to get through airport security. Give yourself plenty of time to get through security, especially during busy travel periods like holidays, so you don't miss your flight. Head through security after checking into your flight. Stop at the your airline's check-in counter at the departure gate at the airport. Afterward, walk toward the nearest security gate leading deeper into the airport. The lines can get pretty lengthy on busy traveling days, but that is why you got to the airport ahead of time. When you pass through security, check the departure boards to find out what gate your flight is at and head there to board when the plane lands. Getting through the airport is relatively simple as long as you took care to pack your bags. The guards will check your carry-on and give you a quick pat-down. Security checkpoints are always in the same area as the airline check-in counters in the opposite direction of the entrance doors. Also, look for screens and signs posted on the walls with information about where your plane is. This information may also be printed on your boarding pass. If you check in online or through an airline app, you do not need to visit the airline counter. Instead, head toward security. Your boarding pass is in the app or an email you can print out at home.",
