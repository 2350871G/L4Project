All you have to do is buy supplies and get to work! In the U.S., for example, the Federal Aviation Administration regulates aircraft. Be aware of any building rules. For instance, the FAA requires you to construct 51% of your plane yourself. Prove this by making a logbook containing photos and videos of your work."

        "Take a flight class from a certified school in your area, then apply with the FAA or your government\u2019s aerial authority.",
        "You won\u2019t be able to use your plane for this, since it has to pass inspections first.",
        "You will use an instructional plane at the school.",
        "The certification board gives you a medical exam, similar to going to a doctor for a check-up.",
        "They may also have you take a written test on flight rules.",
        "Use your pilot\u2019s license to test out many different types of aircraft.",
        "This can help you figure out what kind of plane you want to build.",
        "Bring your plane to an airport.",
        "You will need to transport your plane to an airport before you can fly it.",
