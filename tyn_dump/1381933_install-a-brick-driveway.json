A string line tied between stakes can help guide you while laying out the shape and grade as well as during the actual construction. This will keep you on grade. Be sure the driveway will be able to drain when completed. Excavate the area for the driveway to a depth of at least 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm) and compact the raw sub-grade. Because of the amount of digging and excavated material to be disposed of, it is recommended that you hire an excavation contractor.

You will need either stone screenings or pea-gravel, depending on what is available in your area. Dump the stone in small manageable piles on the sub-grade. Begin spreading the rock using shovels, a Wheelbarrow and a garden rake. Install the stone in at least 2 or, better, 3 lifts using a plate vibrator to compact it together. The small rock will form a solid base once it has been compacted. Hold the last lift of stone to a grade that allows for 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand and the 3 inch (7.6 cm) brick paver. The string line you stretched between the grade stakes in the beginning will help here. Cover the stone with landscape cloth to stop weeds from coming up between the pavers. This will also keep the sand from shifting down through the stone. Place 2 inches (5.1 cm) of sand over the cloth to bed the paver block in.  Set the plastic brick edge retainer in place following manufacturer's instructions.
