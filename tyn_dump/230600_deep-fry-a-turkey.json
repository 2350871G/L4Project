Ice crystals can cause your oil to spatter or even explode, which can cause severe burns to anyone standing nearby. Allow your turkey to thaw for 24 hours for each 5 pounds (2.3 kg) of weight. For instance, a 15 pounds (6.8 kg) turkey would need to defrost in the refrigerator for 3 days. To make sure the turkey is completely thawed, feel it inside and out to make sure there are no cold or hard spots in the meat. Be sure to check between the ribs inside of the turkey's cavity, since this is often the last place to thaw."

Your fryer should have a burner, a solid stand, a hanger or basket, and a thermometer. You will also need a propane tank and a fire extinguisher rated for grease fires. You don't have to have a fryer specifically for turkeys, but it should be big enough to accommodate your bird. Set up your fryer at least 10 feet (3.0 m) away from any buildings. This includes overhangs, garages, and carports. Even if you're very careful, an oil fire can flare up quickly, catching nearby structures on fire. Choose a level spot on concrete or dirt for your fryer and propane tank. You should never place your fryer on a wooden surface, since oil drips can easily catch on fire from the burner. Be sure to place your propane tank as far away from the fryer as you can without stretching the line leading from the tank to the burner. Fill the fryer with the determined amount of vegetable oil. Peanut oil is the most commonly used oil for frying, due to its low smoke point. However, you can use other vegetable oils with a smoke point of at least 450 \u00b0F (232 \u00b0C), including safflower and corn oil. Frying the Turkey Light the burner and monitor the oil until it reaches 350 \u00b0F (177 \u00b0C). You may want to use a long-reach lighter or a long match. Use a thermometer to keep a close eye on the temperature as you heat the oil to make sure it doesn't get too hot. If your oil gets too hot, the outside of your turkey will cook faster than the inside, resulting in an undercooked bird. You also increase your risk of a grease fire.

Attach the handle and lift the turkey to make sure it feels secure. If you have a basket, place the turkey breast-side down. Slowly lower the turkey into the oil. If the oil starts to spit, slowly lift the turkey back out. Do not drop the turkey in the oil! If you have to take the turkey out, double-check that the oil is the correct temperature and that the turkey is completely cleaned out and dried. Usually, spitting oil is a result of moisture coming into contact with the hot grease. Cook the turkey to a temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C). A general guideline for how long this will take is roughly 3 minutes for each pound (0.4 kg) of bird, but you should always go by the internal temperature of the turkey rather than the cooking time. Slowly lift the turkey out of the oil when it's time to check it. If you have a basket, use oven mitts to lift it by the handle. If you are using a hanger, carefully fish the turkey from the fryer.

Cleaning up the Oil Let the oil cool before you dispose of it. Leave the oil in the fryer until it has completely cooled. It should be about room temperature before you attempt to pour it out of the fryer. Pour the oil into disposable containers and throw them away. If you're worried about the oil spilling from the containers, place them in the freezer and let the oil congeal, then discard the containers. Clean the grease from your fryer and the burner. Remnants of used grease can cause a fire next time you use the fryer if you don't thoroughly clean it after each use.",

        "If you have to take the turkey out, double-check that the oil is the correct temperature and that the turkey is completely cleaned out and dried.",

        "Cook the turkey to a temperature of 165 \u00b0F (74 \u00b0C).",
        "A general guideline for how long this will take is roughly 3 minutes for each pound (0.4 kg) of bird, but you should always go by the internal temperature of the turkey rather than the cooking time.",
        "Slowly lift the turkey out of the oil when it's time to check it.",
        "If you have a basket, use oven mitts to lift it by the handle.",

        "Cleaning up the Oil Let the oil cool before you dispose of it.",
        "Leave the oil in the fryer until it has completely cooled.",
        "It should be about room temperature before you attempt to pour it out of the fryer.",
        "Pour the oil into disposable containers and throw them away.",
        "If you're worried about the oil spilling from the containers, place them in the freezer and let the oil congeal, then discard the containers.",
        "Clean the grease from your fryer and the burner.",
        "Remnants of used grease can cause a fire next time you use the fryer if you don't thoroughly clean it after each use."
