If you are not breeding the goldfish, you want to maintain a consistent temperature of 23 Celsius (74 Fahrenheit). Because goldfish normally live in a fairly bright tropical environment, they need some sunlight during the day and darkness at night. If you use an aquarium light, you\u2019ll need to turn it off at night so that your goldfish can rest. If your goldfish don\u2019t get enough light, their color will fade."

Although both internal and external filtration systems will do the trick, you\u2019re more likely to get that kind of flow rate with an external system.

        "Take a water sample with the syringe included in your master test kit.",
        "Shake the bottle for nitrates and add the required number of drops to the test tube.",
        "Match the color to the color chart to determine nitrate concentration.",
        "Also, test for ammonia and nitrites.",
        "If the ammonia and nitrite levels go down to zero but there is some nitrate, your tank is successfully cycled and ready for fish!",
        "You\u2019ll still need to add ammonia to feed the good bacteria up until the day you add your goldfish.",
        "Add one fish at a time.",
        "You\u2019ll want to change half of your water in order to lower nitrate levels prior to adding your fish.",
        "To be safe, you should add one fish at a time.",
        "Since the aquarium is a very delicate setup, it is best to see how one fish lives in the tank before adding any more.",
        "After you add the one goldfish, you should keep testing the water for nitrates, ammonia, and nitrites.",
        "You want low levels of ammonia and nitrites, but some nitrates are fine.",
        "You can add the next goldfish after testing the water for two weeks to make sure the tank is cycling properly and there is sufficient water volume in the tank to handle the additional fish."
