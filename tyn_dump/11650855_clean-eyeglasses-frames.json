Polishing Plastic Frames Apply a coin-sized amount of polish or oil to a soft cloth. Get out your pair of plastic frames that look dull or covered in white film and set them on a work surface. Take a clean soft cloth and squirt a coin-sized amount of furniture polish or lubricating multipurpose oil onto it.Tip: Don't use a paper towel since it can leave lint on your frames. You could use a cotton cloth or microfiber cloth instead. Rub the cloth over the plastic frames. Use gentle pressure to rub the polish or oil onto the surface of your frames.
