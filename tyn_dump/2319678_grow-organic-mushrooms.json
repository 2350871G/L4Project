Inoculate the logs within two weeks. The longer you wait to use your logs, the more you risk having the wood rot. Moreover, logs that have rested for too long can sometimes react poorly to inoculation and may grow inedible fungus, rather than edible mushrooms. Drill holes in the logs. The spawn plugs should come with instructions about how big the holes should be, but for many plugs, you should use a 5/16 inch (7.9 mm) drill bit. Drill holes in a diamond pattern.

Cover the bucket with plastic wrap. The plastic wrap helps the mixture retain moisture. Puncture the wrap, poking several hold in it, to prevent the build up of carbon dioxide.
