Puppies will sense your confidence levels, and bad habits can develop at a young age if you are not consistent. This doesn't mean punishing your nine week old puppy if he chews a rug, but is more about clarifying your control over certain aspects, such as when your puppy must be in his crate. Be sure you have time set aside to be close to him when he first arrives at your house. He will need careful supervision in the very first weeks. Techniques used on older puppies, such making your puppy walk at heel or behind you, or only being fed after you have eaten, will not be so successful with such a young puppy. But you can begin to assert your position but not breaking eye contact, and showing him that he is only fed at particular times."

When your puppy is at this very young stage, he may be required to spend quite a lot of time in their crate, but remember this is just temporary. It is keeping them safe and helping them adapt. Help your puppy get used to the crate by initially being home when he is in it. You do not want him to associate the crate with being abandoned. Motivate your puppy to enter the crate. You should sit with him after keeping the door close for a few minutes. When your puppy investigates the crate, shower him with a lot of praise and show a lot of enthusiasm.

Some of the subtle signs could include him walking a few feet away, walking around in a circles, or sniffing the ground in circles. Every time he changes between different activities you should take him outside. So, when he wakes up, stops eating, or stops playing, take him outside.

He will stop for a moment and step back, and then you can go on playing as normal.

You can teach him \"down\" by starting from a sitting position and holding the treat in front of his nose. Lower the treat down and he will lower down. Say \"down\" as he moves and then give him and treat and praise him. You may need to keep one hand above his back to discourage him from standing up.

This will normally prompt him to drop the object and take a step backwards. Be sure to use the command \"drop\". If blowing doesn't work, gently squeeze one of his front paws.

Take hold of him as he goes past and praise him for returning. Then you can begin to get him interested in the second toy you are holding.
