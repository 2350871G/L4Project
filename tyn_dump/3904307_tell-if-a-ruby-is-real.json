Fakes are more likely to contain blemishes and impure spots. That said: rubies do sometimes have imperfections. Use the \"stoplight red\" as a guide, but do not expect to find a real ruby that is actually that bright. If you do, then the ruby is likely fake. A real ruby should be more like a bright traffic light, however, than like a dull stone."
