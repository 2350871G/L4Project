Divide your tree or trees into sections. Avoid wrapping the lights around your tree as if it were a maypole.

Avoid connecting more than 300 lights to one another as they may burn out. Look for dead spots. Any dark holes need to be filled. Rearrange your lights to fill in any gaps or until you\u2019re satisfied. Use a painter\u2019s pole to string lights without a ladder. Remove the roller from a painters pole and use the metal bracket to string lights on trees that are 10 feet or taller without having to use a ladder. Work your way to the bottom and use another extension cord if needed. Plug any additional extension cords to your main power strip. Wrap your plugs with electrical tape to help keep them together as well as protect them from water. Use floodlights to show off evergreens. Use blue, white, or green lamps.

Keeping Safe Make sure all your lights are compatible. Christmas tree lights can be end to end or stacked. End to end is also known as string to string. Stacked plugs can join more light strands together relative to string to string plugs. Read the boxes to ensure that your lights are compatible before purchasing. Check the wattage of the bulbs. Don\u2019t plug more than two extension cords to one another and make sure that they can handle the wattage of the bulbs. Only buy the lengths of light string and extension cord that you will be using. Make sure that all the lights you are using have the same wattage to prevent power surges. This will also prolong the life of your lights. Plug in your lights before removing them from the box. Make sure all the lights work before placing them on your tree. You don\u2019t want any live wires or broken bulbs in your tree as they can be fire hazards. Use miniature clear lights as base lighting. Miniature white lights make great base lighting when coupled with strands of larger cool-burning bulbs that come in a variety of colour. You may also add novelty lights like flashing lights, flickering flames, bubble lights, or lights of various shapes along with miniature lights.",
