Discuss this procedure with your veterinarian during your regular puppy visits or at the first visit after adopting an adult dog.

As an adult, find a high-quality food with meat as the first ingredient listed on the bag's label. Crude protein should be no less than 30 percent and crude fat no less than 20 percent. The fiber content needs to be 4 percent or less. Rottweilers are susceptible to gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), which is a dangerous accumulation of gas in the stomach. To help prevent this life-threatening condition, feed two or three smaller, non-fatty meals a day (not in elevated bowls) and don\u2019t mix dry food and water. Try to restrict your pup\u2019s activity for at least an hour after feeding. It is always important to allow your dog access to a fresh, clean water source. Keep a hand towel nearby for wiping up excessive drool or slobber that, unfortunately, is a common occurrence for this breed. While you should always have clean water available for your Rottweiler, stop the dog from drinking large amounts at one time since it can also lead to GDV. Remember that as your pup grows, Rottweilers can weigh up to 135 pounds\u2014though your dog is likelier to average around 90-110 pounds. Ensure that you have plenty of space for such a large dog!"

        "EXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPippa Elliott, MRCVS\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVeterinarian\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDr. Elliott, BVMS, MRCVS is a veterinarian with over 30 years of experience in veterinary surgery and companion animal practice.",
        "She graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1987 with a degree in veterinary medicine and surgery.",
        "She has worked at the same animal clinic in her hometown for over 20 years.",
        "Pippa Elliott, MRCVS\t\t\tVeterinarian\t\t\t\tPippa Elliott, a licensed veterinarian, suggests: \"If buying a puppy, look for a breeder that screens the parents for disease such as hip dysplasia.",
        "Also, make sure the breeder has a socialization plan in place for the pups, from an early age.\"",
        "Stay up to date on vaccinations and preventative medications.",
        "Make sure that your dog has had all of the necessary immunizations in order to keep both the dog and you healthy.",
        "The standard immunizations include rabies\u2014which is administered at twelve weeks of age or older\u2014and then every one to three years depending on your local laws and your vet\u2019s recommendations.",
        "Distemper, parvovirus, hepatitis, and para influenza are usually administered together.",
        "Puppies should receive a set of four injections every three weeks starting at six weeks of age and then annually, as adults, again based on your veterinarian's recommendations.",
        "Your veterinarian will also make recommendations for items such as monthly heartworm preventive, flea & tick preventive, and deworming protocols based on the season and specific region you live in.",
        "Have your Rottweiler spayed or neutered.",
        "Spaying and neutering are procedures that prevent unwanted pregnancies and can help to eliminate many health and behavioral issues.",
        "Ideally a Rottweiler puppy should have this done at around six months of age.",
        "Discuss this procedure with your veterinarian during your regular puppy visits or at the first visit after adopting an adult dog.",
        "Neutering can prevent testicular cancers, prostate problems, urinary marking, and some aggressive behaviors in males.",
        "Spayed females have a greatly reduced incidence of mammary tumors (If desexed before their second season) and no possibility of uterine infections or uterine cancer.",
        "Feed your Rottweiler a high-quality diet.",
        "If a puppy, feed your Rottweiler a diet labeled specifically for large-breed puppies to ensure healthy bones and joints as the puppy grows.",
        "As an adult, find a high-quality food with meat as the first ingredient listed on the bag's label.",
        "Crude protein should be no less than 30 percent and crude fat no less than 20 percent.",
        "The fiber content needs to be 4 percent or less.",
        "Rottweilers are susceptible to gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), which is a dangerous accumulation of gas in the stomach.",
        "To help prevent this life-threatening condition, feed two or three smaller, non-fatty meals a day (not in elevated bowls) and don\u2019t mix dry food and water.",
        "Try to restrict your pup\u2019s activity for at least an hour after feeding.",
        "It is always important to allow your dog access to a fresh, clean water source.",
        "Keep a hand towel nearby for wiping up excessive drool or slobber that, unfortunately, is a common occurrence for this breed.",
        "While you should always have clean water available for your Rottweiler, stop the dog from drinking large amounts at one time since it can also lead to GDV.",
        "Remember that as your pup grows, Rottweilers can weigh up to 135 pounds\u2014though your dog is likelier to average around 90-110 pounds.",
        "Ensure that you have plenty of space for such a large dog!",
        "Brush twice a week.",
        "Rottweilers tend to have short, smooth hair that requires less brushing than many breeds\u2014roughly twice a week.",
        "The best type of brush to use on your dog is a rubber hound mitt or soft bristle brush.",
        "In general, the coat is easy to maintain, but the breed will shed much more than you would think.",
        "Invest in lint rollers for your furniture and clothes if shedding becomes an issue for you.",
        "Bathe when they are dirty.",
        "Your Rottweiler\u2019s short hair also means less frequent bathing.",
        "Bathe as necessary, such as if your pup decides to roll around outside.",
        "During bath time, also use an ear cleaner to flush out your dog's ears.",
        "Do not use a cotton swab to remove the waxy debris from the ear.",
        "Use a cotton ball or a paper towel wrapped around one of your fingers instead.",
        "Trim your Rottweiler\u2019s nails regularly (about every two weeks).",
        "Long nails on your dog can easily lead to discomfort or injury while running or digging or even from catching on your carpet.",
        "At the ideal length, you won\u2019t hear the clicking of the nails across hard-surface flooring.",
        "Also be careful not to trim your Rottweiler\u2019s nails too short since trimming to the quick can cause bleeding and pain for your dog.",
        "If you\u2019re unfamiliar, consult your vet before the first time you trim your dog\u2019s nails for the ideal point at which to clip them.",
        "Brush your dog\u2019s teeth.",
        "Though an often-forgotten part of caring for a dog, dental care is important.",
        "It can also help cut down on the possibility of expensive vet bills later on due to costly tooth extractions.",
        "Consult your vet for an approved toothpaste and brush as directed by the product.",
        "Take on at least two walks daily.",
        "Rottweilers are large dogs that need plenty of exercise.",
        "You should take your dog on at least two walks a day, each lasting ten to twenty minutes.",
        "Without exercise, you may have a bored and potentially destructive dog on your hands.",
        "This could come in the form of chewed-on furniture in your home or massive holes dug in your yard.",
        "Some Rottweilers prefer to be lazy dogs that are happy lounging on the couch all day with no desire to be exercised.",
        "In that type of situation, although there may be less work involved for you, it is easy for a Rottweiler to become overweight, which can lead to a variety of health issues, such as diabetes and injuries to their knees and hips.",
        "Rottweilers have a natural tendency to play rough, so do not be surprised if your Rottweiler plays and romps with vigor and occasionally sends things flying, including people.",
        "Have fun with your pup during exercise, but be careful too!",
        "Get in plenty of playtime.",
        "In addition to walks, you also want to spend some time each day playing with your Rottweiler.",
        "Playing fetch and tug of war are two easy games that your dog will pick up quickly.",
        "Training and puzzle toys can be a great backyard or in-home option for some added mind stimulation.",
        "These types of toys can easily be found at your local pet supply store.",
        "Remember that a Rottweiler is a big dog.",
        "Choose toys that aren\u2019t so small they\u2019ll create a choking hazard for your dog.",
        "For more information on teaching your Rottweiler games, check out How to Play with Your Dog.",
        "Rottweilers also bond very closely to their owners, so be ready for plenty of affection as well.",
        "Make routine trips to the vet.",
        "Rottweilers are prone to certain health concerns.",
        "Some of the more common ones include parvovirus, hip dysplasia, osteosarcoma, entropion, diabetes, gastric torsion, ruptured cruciate ligaments, skin tumors, and muscle and nerve diseases.",
        "Most of these concerns are treatable.",
        "Some may only require a simple medication while others may need to be corrected with a surgical procedure.",
        "Consult with your veterinarian about any health concerns you may have regarding your Rottweiler.",
        "Routine physical exams, which can include fecal exams, a heartworm test, and routine blood work, will help detect any health issues that need to be addressed in order to maintain your Rottweiler's long-term health.",
        "If cared for properly and in good health, your Rottweiler can be a loving companion for up to ten or even twelve years.",
        "Socializing and Training Your Rottweiler Pick a puppy that shows evidence of prior socialization.",
        "Training and socializing your Rottweiler are two of the most important parts of owning the breed, and the process should start before the puppy even leaves the breeder.",
        "Well-socialized pups are accustomed to many different sounds and actions going on around them, and your presence shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise.",
        "A shy, withdrawn, or overly cautious pup is probably not well socialized and has not been exposed to a lot of different situations.",
        "A less socialized pup may make just as good a pet as one who isn\u2019t, simply requiring more time when training.",
        "Take your dog out in public.",
        "Exposing your Rottweiler to other people, animals, and locations as young as possible is another great way to help socialize the breed.",
        "If at a dog park, slowly introduce your dog to the other dogs and people around you while still on the leash.",
        "If your dog seems to be friendly and comfortable and welcomes the interaction, offer praise for the good behavior and gradually allow more interaction off leash and in larger areas.",
        "If possible, you should also enroll the puppy in \u201ckindergarten\u201d obedience classes starting around ten or twelve weeks old.",
        "Have patience.",
        "Each dog will develop social skills at his or her own speed, so go as slow as needed.",
        "As your dog becomes more socialized and comfortable with new things, you will see that he or she develops an overall better temperament.",
        "Don't forget to introduce cats, children, and anything else that you want your dog to be familiar and comfortable with as well.",
        "Start training early.",
        "In addition to socializing your Rottweiler, you\u2019ll also need to do plenty of obedience training, which can require dedication and patience.",
        "Your Rottweiler will need to know that you are the dominant one in the relationship.",
        "This role can be especially difficult to master for first-time dog owners.",
        "Obedience schools can be a good option from the very beginning or to correct unwanted behaviors.",
        "It will be beneficial for you and your new pup to train with voice commands as well as hand signals.",
        "The upside to training with both of these commands is that if you are in a situation where your dog can't hear you, your hand signal will still communicate what you\u2019re asking to the dog.",
        "Use positive reinforcement.",
        "Positive reinforcement goes a long way with this breed as Rottweilers enjoy pleasing their owners.",
        "After bonding to you, your dog will love your attention, so ignoring your dog when he or she exhibits bad behavior will work better than other disciplinary measures.",
        "Consult a professional trainer.",
        "During any sort of training, if you feel overwhelmed or your dog doesn't seem to be learning at a reasonable pace, consult a professional trainer or canine behaviorist.",
        "They will be able to answer any questions or concerns you may be having about the process or techniques that you are using."
