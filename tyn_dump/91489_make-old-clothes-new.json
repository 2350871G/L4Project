You\u2019ll need a matching button, a needle, thread, and scissors. Double thread the needle and knot the end. Bring the needle up through the wrong side of the fabric and one hole of the button. Bring the needle back down through an opposite hole, and repeat this process of going up through one hole and down through an opposite hole six times with the same two holes. Do the same thing with the other two holes that you haven\u2019t used yet. You will end up with the thread making an equals sign on your button. Tie a secure knot in the thread by passing the needle through the stitches on the wrong side of the fabric stopping short to create a loop. Then pass the needle through the loop and pull tightly to create a knot. Repeat this twice to make a secure knot."

Cut the large portion of the shirt that\u2019s left up the sides to create two identical large rectangles of fabric. These will be the body of the dress. Use a sewing machine to sew the smaller rectangles of fabric to the bottom larger body pieces of fabric. You should end up with two dress pieces, the front and the back. Make sure you sew the wrong sides of the fabric together. Sew the front of the dress to the back of the dress, by sewing the sides together. Then, sew elastic for under the bust of the dress.
