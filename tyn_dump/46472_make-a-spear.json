Hardwoods, such as ash or oak, are best for this project. To sharpen your spear, find some sort of rough surface such as stone, or a brick wall/ sidewalk. Rub it against the surface and sharpen it well. If you are making a spear in the wilderness, search surrounding areas for a sapling of the right size.
