    "text": " Boiling Raw Bamboo Shoots Wash the bamboo under running water. Move all of the shoots to the sink. The water temperature doesn\u2019t matter, so keep it lukewarm for safety. Rinse each shoot to remove any dirt on it. If you are using canned or vacuum-sealed bamboo shoots, rinsing is all you need to do. The shoots are pre-cooked, so you can use them right away in any recipe. Slice through the shoots\u2019 outer layer. Place the shoots flat on a cutting board. Hold a sharp knife flat against the shoot\u2019s top end. Work the knife underneath the shoot\u2019s rough, green outer layer. Cut from the top all the way to the shoot\u2019s bottom end. Pry off the outer layer by hand. Use the cut you made to get your fingers underneath the tough outer layer. Pull the bamboo and the outer layer in different directions to separate them. Continue peeling off the outer layer until you see the white inner portion. Cut off more layers until the bamboo feels tender. Touch the bamboo with your fingers. The white inner flesh should feel soft to the touch. If it doesn\u2019t, cut and pry off another layer. Repeat this until you reach a layer that feels soft to the touch. Slice about 1 in (2.5 cm) off the root end. The root is the shoot\u2019s rounded, wider end. Measure about 1 in (2.5 cm) and cut all the way through the shoot. This part is too bitter to eat, so throw it out. Check to make sure you have removed all of the tough or woody parts on the stem. It should feel soft as well. Place the shoots in a pot.

Wait about 10 minutes for the shoots to cool off, then take them out using tongs or by draining the water into a collander. Making a Pork Stir-Fry Cut up the vegetables and chili pepper. Slice the cooked bamboo shoots into thin strips. Also chop up the onion, garlic, and chili pepper. Open the chili pepper pieces to scrape out the seeds. Heat olive oil over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of olive oil to a wok or large pan. Turn the heat up to a medium setting and wait for the oil to get hot. Peanut oil works well in a stir-fry and can be used in place of the olive oil. Cook the shoots for a few minutes until they shrivel up. Stir the sliced bamboo shoots into the oil. After a few minutes, you should be able to smell the shoots cooking. They will also shrivel up from losing moisture.

You can turn the heat up to high in order to get the other ingredients done faster. Cook the garlic, onion, and chili for a few minutes. Stir the cut-up ingredients into the oil. After about a minute, you should be able to smell the ingredients cooking. Brown and season the pork. Dump the pork in the pot, stirring it in with the other ingredients. Cook it until it browns and appears cooked through. Mix in the salt to season the pork. Add the wine and cook it for 1 minute. Pour in the wine next. Mix the ingredients around to coat them in it. Leave the pan to cook for another minute. Mix in the remaining ingredients. First, add the bamboo shoots back into the pan. Follow it with the soy sauce, rice vinegar, and chicken broth. Mix everything together to ready it for the final few minutes of cooking. Cook the ingredients for 2 minutes. For the final 2 minutes, stir the ingredients in the pot every few seconds. This activates and infuses the flavors in all of the ingredients. Drizzle the sesame oil over the stir-fry. Gradually pour the sesame oil into the pan. Stir the ingredients one last time to distribute the oil evenly. As soon as you are done, serve and enjoy the stir-fry. Store any leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator. It should last a couple of days. Cooking a Vegetarian Stir-Fry Slice up the vegetables and chiles. Cut the mushrooms, carrots, beans, and bamboo shoots lengthwise into slices 1 in (2.5 cm) wide. Also slice up the chiles, but don\u2019t remove the seeds. Heat sesame oil over medium-high heat. Pour the oil into a wok or a large pan. Wait a couple of minutes for the oil to get hot. Cook the chiles for 2 minutes. Place the chiles in the oil and let them cook until they become fragrant. This happens between 1 and 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cook for 7 to 9 minutes. They lose moisture as they cook, so watch for any signs of shriveling. If this happens, move on to the next step immediately. Stir in the carrots and cook them for 2 minutes. Mix in the carrots to get them coated in the oil. After about 2 minutes, they will have softened. Add the beans and cook them for 4 minutes. Stir them into the oil, then wait between 3 to 4 minutes for them to soften. Stir in the bamboo and cook it for 3 minutes. Move the cooked and sliced bamboo into the pan. Stir it to coat it in oil, then let it stir-fry for 3 more minutes. Mix in the soy sauce and cook for 1 more minute. Pour the soy sauce into the pan and mix the ingredients to coat them evenly in it. Wait 1 last minute as the stir-fry finishes. Immediately serve and enjoy it. Store any leftovers in a sealed container in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for a couple of days.",
