        "Only use a sealer meant for gas pipes to prevent leaks.",
        "Screw a flexible gas line onto the stove with a wrench.",
        "A flexible gas line is made of corrugated metal and can easily bend to fit into tight spaces.",
        "Make sure the flexible gas line has the same size threading on the end or else it will not fit your stove without an adaptor.",
        "Screw one end of the gas line onto the regulator\u2019s threading by hand.",
        "When you can\u2019t turn it anymore, hold the nut on the regulator in place with channel lock pliers and tighten the end of the gas line using a wrench.",
        "You can buy flexible gas lines from hardware or appliance stores.",
        "Don\u2019t reuse an old flexible gas line since it may be more prone to leaking.",
        "Put sealer on the threads of the main gas pipe before attaching the flexible line.",
        "Coat the threaded port on the main gas pipe with your pipe sealer so the gas doesn\u2019t escape.",
        "Screw the flexible gas line clockwise by hand until you can\u2019t turn it anymore.",
        "Grip the nut on the main gas pipe with channel lock pliers so it doesn\u2019t move around, and use an adjustable wrench to tighten the flexible pipe more.",
        "Be careful not to overtighten the pipes since they could crack or get damaged.",
        "Testing Your Gas Combine dish soap and water in a spray bottle.",
        "Fill a small spray bottle with water from your sink and add a few drops of liquid dish soap.",
        "Shake the bottle so the soap mixes with the water and forms suds.",
        "Test spraying the bottle in your sink a few times to make sure it works before using it to check your pipes.",
        "You can also use a gas leak detection liquid if you want.",
        "You can buy the detection liquid from your local hardware store.",
        "Turn the gas back on for your stove.",
        "Find the valve on the main gas pipe for your stove, which should be perpendicular to the pipes and in the off position.",
        "Rotate the valve so it\u2019s parallel to the pipes so the gas is on.",
        "This allows the gas into the flexible line and stove so you can check the seals between the pipes.",
        "If you can smell natural gas after you turn on the gas, then immediately turn it off and reseal the gas lines.",
        "Spray the soapy water onto the gas line connections to your stove.",
        "Hold the spray bottle as close to the connections you sealed and spray some of the soapy water onto them.",
        "Make sure you apply the soapy water all the way around the pipe so it\u2019s completely wet.",
        "If there\u2019s a gas leak, the soapy water will start to bubble around the connections so you know that there\u2019s a small leak.",
        "Check each of the connections you made and mark any of them that are leaking.",
        "If the soapy water doesn\u2019t bubble, then you don\u2019t need to make any changes.",
        "Tighten any loose connections before testing for leaks again.",
        "Hold the nut on the main gas pipe in place with your channel lock pliers and then use a wrench to tighten the flexible line.",
        "Screw it on until you can\u2019t get it any tighter.",
        "Repeat the process for any other connections that were bubbling after you applied the soapy water.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, spray more soapy water onto the connection to check it again.Tip: If the pipes are still leaking after you tighten them, then you may need to reapply the sealer to the threadings.",
        "Push the stove into place so it fits in the space.",
        "Carefully slide the stove into the space where you plan on installing it.",
        "Continue pushing it back until the front of the stove is in line or slightly extends out from the front of your counter and cabinets.",
        "Use a level on top of the stove to ensure that it still sits flat, and adjust any feet as you need to.",
        "Ask a helper to assist you so you don\u2019t damage your floors by accident.",
        "Turn on each burner individually to test them.",
        "One by one, turn each burner on your stove onto high until you hear the igniter clicking.",
        "The igniter will take about 4 seconds before the flame starts, but it may take slightly longer the first time you turn it on.",
        "Once the flame starts, turn the burner to low to ensure the gas flow adjusts properly.",
        "Turn the burner off when you\u2019re done testing it before moving onto the next one.",
        "If the burners do not work, then you may need to check your gas supply line again to see if the valve is turned on.",
        "If it is, then you may need to contact a technician to check your stove for you."
