You can purchase a regular pedometer that tracks steps for $15 USD online. You can also purchase a fitness tracking device, like a Fitbit or Garmin, which will keep track of your heart rate and sleeping patterns, too. These devices range from $50 USD to $150 USD online. Regular pedometers clip to your belt or pants and track each time your hip moves up and down. Fitness trackers are often worn on the wrist and double as watches. Many smartphones also have built-in fitness apps that will also count your daily steps. If your phone does not come with a pedometer app, you can download one in your phone's app store."
