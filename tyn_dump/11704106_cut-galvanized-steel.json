After this, use a marker to take note of your measurement. To measure the width of the metal, mark along the length of a T-square ruler. If you don\u2019t have a marker on hand, chalk line can also work. A T-square ruler is a metal ruler that forms a right angle at the bottom. Look for 1 online or at a hardware store."

Use 1 hand to lift 1 half of the sheet metal while using your opposite hand to cut along your pre-marked line with slow, gradual cuts. The process of using tin snips is very similar to using scissors. Lifting 1 side of the metal helps to give you leverage while you cut. If you\u2019re using a table as your workspace, you don\u2019t need to lift the metal. Tin snips tend to come with red or green handles. Red-handled tools are best for cutting curved edges, while green handles work well when cutting straight edges. However, if you only have red-handled snips, use those to cut straight edges.Tip: Wear thick leather gloves and safety glasses to protect yourself."
