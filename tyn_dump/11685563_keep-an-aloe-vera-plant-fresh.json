Ideally, try to place your plant near a window on the eastern side of your home, which gets the most consistent amount of light throughout the day. If your home doesn\u2019t have this, opt for a southern- or western-facing window.The northern hemisphere receives the most sunlight from southern-facing windows; however, this amount isn\u2019t consistent, which doesn\u2019t always make it optimal for indoor plants like aloe. If you live in the southern hemisphere, place your indoor plants next to a north-facing window, or another window that receives a consistent amount of light. You can also keep your aloe outside if you live in a consistently warm area. While aloe is well-known for being an indoor plant, you can plant in an outdoor garden if your home is grouped under zone 10 or above on the USDA Plant Hardiness Map.
