By leaving the fruit on a plate and surrounding it with water, you can keep any ants away from your butterflies\u2019 food. Bees and wasps will also eat the fruit you leave out, so be careful so you or your family do not get stung. Use sugar water on the bottom plate to give your butterflies a sweet drink. Some birds may eat the fruit you leave out as well, but may grow disinterested when the fruit is overripe."
