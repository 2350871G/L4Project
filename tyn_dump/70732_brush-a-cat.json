Ticks are very small when they're not gorged with blood. They're brown with teardrop-shaped bodies. When they're full of blood, they look like large gray cysts hanging out of the animal's skin. If you find a tick unattached to your cat's skin, grab it as quickly as possible with a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to pinch your cat's skin. Kill the tick by drowning it in a small container of rubbing alcohol. If the tick has its head in your cat's skin, smother the area with petroleum jelly first. This will cut off the tick's source of air and cause it to back its head out. When it does back out, grab it with the tweezers and drown it in the rubbing alcohol.
