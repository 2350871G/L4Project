Use a pair of sterilized hand shears to cut away the other growth to the main stem of the plant. Gooseberry branches should fan outward from the main stem and shouldn't cross over the middle of the plant. Isolating 5 branches will allow your gooseberry plant to focus its energy on those branches, which will lead to bigger harvesting yields."
