If you want to water each plant on its own, choose a dripper system to give your plants a direct water source. A dripper system consists of many square, flat waterspout-like \"drippers\" hooked to your irrigation piping that emit a small, steady water flow. Dripper systems also work well for potted outdoor plants. If you have a large yard or want to cover more area, you may want to choose another system."

Pick a sprinkler system if you have a large yard that needs even watering. Sprinkler irrigation systems consist of many sprinkler bulbs hooked to the irrigation piping that spray water out of their nozzles. Buy a sprayer or bubbler system as a hybrid between drippers and sprinklers. Sprayers and bubblers have adjustable radiuses and can provide either direct or general attention to plants in your yard.

Sprayer and bubbler systems look like a cross between sprinklers and bubblers. They are generally flat and square, with a nozzle on top that sprays a steady water flow. Bubbler and sprayer systems tend to have a smaller radius than sprinkler systems. Planning the System Measure your yard's perimeter and area. Take measurements of the perimeter and area of your yard. Take measurements of the length and width, then multiply these numbers to find the land's total area. Work slowly to keep the land's measurements as accurate as possible. Purchase grid paper to map out your irrigation system. Grid paper can keep your drawing precise. Assign each grid a certain distance to help you visualize your backyard and plan an accurate layout. You might assign each grid, for example, a distance of 1 square foot (0.093 square meters). Draw an approximate layout of the irrigation system. Using your yard measurements, map out an approximate layout of your yard. Mark your yard's water source, power source, main plants or garden areas, and areas where you will install the irrigation tubing. The water source is generally the outdoor faucet, and the power source is the way you'll turn the system on and off.
