Temperatures from 35 to 48 degrees F (1.7 to 8.9 degrees C) are ideal. The bulbs will not grow properly if it is either too cold or too hot. Cover the soil in the pot with a loose layer of leaves or sawdust to help regulate the temperature. Pick a location that is dark and cool. Good options include  sheds, garages or refrigerators. In climates where it does not freeze outside, you can dig a hole and bury the plant outside. Keep soil moist, but don't overwater."
