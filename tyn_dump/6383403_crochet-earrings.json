Double crochet into the chain. Work 12 double crochet into the fourth chain stitch from the hook. When finished, slip stitch the last double crochet to the the top of the beginning chain-four. The piece should develop its circular form after you complete this step. Double crochet around. Chain three, then work two double crochet into each double crochet of the previous round. Slip stitch the last double crochet into the top of the chain-three made at the start of this round. Fasten off the yarn. Cut the yarn, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. This step finishes the actual crochet work for one earring, but you'll still need to attach the piece to an earring hook before you can wear it. Do not trim the tail any further than this. You'll need plenty of excess to attach the circle to the earring hook. Tie the circle to the earring hook. Thread the long tail end of yarn through the loop on the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the yarn around this loop to hold the crochet circle in place. Draw as much yarn through the earring loop as possible before knotting it. Ideally, the knot should remain hidden behind the crochet piece. That knot should also be very small so that it won't be visible from the front. Weave in the ends. Weave the excess tails into the stitches along the back of the circle. Consider trimming the excess ends down to a length between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) before weaving them into the piece. Attempting to weave too much excess into the stitches can cause those stitches to lose form. Repeat for the other earring. Follow the same exact steps to complete another earring that matches the first. Crochet the circle, attach it to another earring hook, and weave in the yarn ends. Once you complete both earrings, the set is finished and ready to wear. Method Two: Dainty Doilies[2]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Make a magic ring. Make a magic adjustable ring with three chains. Form a loop with the thread and insert the hook beneath both overlapping ends. Hook onto the thread from the ball end of the yarn, then pull it up through the original loop. Make three chain stitches from the yarn on your hook to set the ring up for your pattern. Double crochet into the ring. Work nine double crochet into the center of the magic ring. After making your stitches, gently pull the yarn ends away from one another to close the ring. Slip stitch the last double crochet into the top of the chain-three to complete the first round. Chain and single crochet around. Chain one, then work one single crochet into the same stitch as the previous round's slip stitch. Chain one, then work two single crochet into the next double crochet of the previous round; repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the round. At the end of the round, slip stitch the last stitch to the first single crochet of the round. Work another round of chains and single crochet. Slip stitch into the first chain-one space, then work five chain stitches. Single crochet once into the next chain-one space. Chain four, then single crochet once into the next chain-one space; repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the round. Slip stitch the last stitch to the first chain of this round. Fasten off the thread. Cut the thread. leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. The actual doily ornament is finished once you complete this step, but you'll still need to attach it to an earring hook before you can wear it. Do not trim or weave in the tail yet.

Knot the thread over this loop to attach the doily to the wire. Pull the thread as taut as possible before knotting it, and try to make the knot as small as possible. Ideally, the knot should remain hidden behind the doily and should not be visible from the front. Weave in the excess. Weave the excess thread into the back side of the doily stitches. Consider trimming the excess down to a length between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm). Since these earrings are fairly dainty, weaving too much excess into the stitches could cause them to become bulky and distorted. Repeat for the second earring. Follow the same steps to complete another earring that matches the first. Crochet the doily, attach it to the earring hook, and weave in the excess. After completing the second earring, the pair should be finished and ready to show off. Method Three: Wrapped Hoops Attach the thread to the crochet hook. Tie the crochet thread onto the tip of the steel crochet hook using a standard slip knot. In this pattern, you'll need to crochet around the edge of a blank hoop earring. As a result, you'll move directly into the pattern stitches instead of building up a foundation of chains. Stitch the yarn to the earring hoop. Work one slip stitch over the edge of the metal hoop, positioning the stitch within 1/4 inch (6 mm) of one end. Hold the hook over the front of the earring hoop while directing the working end of the thread beneath the hoop. Hook the thread over the edge of the hoop, as though working over the edge of a stitch, and pull it through the loop on your hook. This completes the slip stitch and secures the thread to the earring hoop. Work one single crochet around the earring. Single crochet once around the edge of the metal hoop, positioning the stitch directly next to the previous slip stitch. Position the tip of the hook beneath the earring hoop and hook the thread. Pull the hooked thread around to the front of the earring hoop. Hook the thread again from the front, then pull this newest loop through the two thread loops beneath it. This completes the first single crochet. Single crochet around the entire hoop. Continue making single crochet stitches around the rest of the earring hoop, stopping within 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of the opposite end. Note that you may need to periodically push the formed single crochet stitches down the side of the earring to keep them even. Chain and single crochet a second row. Work one chain stitch and turn the earring. Chain three, skip over one stitch from the previous row, and single crochet once into the stitch that follows. Chain three, skip one stitch, and single crochet once into the following stitch; complete this pattern until you reach the end of the earring. Fasten off the thread. Cut the thread, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. Weave the excess thread into the stitches, hiding as much as possible. Trim away any excess that cannot be hidden. Repeat for the second hoop. Repeat the same steps to complete another wrapped hoop that matches the first. Attach the yarn to the side of the hoop, crochet the pattern over the hoop, and fasten off the work. Once you finish the second earring, the set is done and ready to wear. Method Four: Dangling Spirals[3]\n\tX\n\t\tResearch source Chain 34. Attach the thread to the crochet hook using a standard slip knot, then work a foundation of 34 chain stitches. Triple crochet down the chain. Chain three, then work three triple crochet into the second stitch from the hook. Chain one, skip a stitch, and work three triple crochet into the stitch that follows; repeat this pattern until you reach the final stitch of your foundation chain. As you work down the chain, you should notice the piece curling into the desired spiral shape. Double and single crochet at the end. Work one double crochet, one single crochet, and one slip stitch into the final stitch of the foundation chain. Work all three of these stitches into the same chain. These will be the last stitches you'll make, so you should be able to see the finished spiral form by the end of this step. Fasten off the thread. Cut the thread, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off. You'll need a long tail to attach the spiral to the earring hook, so do not trim it after fastening off the work. Attach the spiral to the earring hook. Thread the tail through the loop at the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the thread around this loop. Keep the thread fairly taut as you tie it and only make a small knot. The knot itself will be visible, but you should not see any unused thread in between the spiral and the earring hook. Weave in the ends. Weave any excess thread into the stitches at the inside of the spiral to both secure and hide it. Consider trimming the excess down to roughly 2 inches (5 cm) before weaving it into the stitches. Weaving in too much excess can distort the shape of the spiral. Repeat for the other earring. Repeat the same steps to make another earring that matches the first. Crochet the spiral, attach it to the earring hook, and weave in the excess. After making the second earring, the set is finished and ready to show off. Finished. ",
