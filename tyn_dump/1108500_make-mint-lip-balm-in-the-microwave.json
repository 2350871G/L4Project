Ensure that the container is microwave safe and will allow you to mix the ingredients in it easily. Use pure peppermint extract or pure peppermint essential oil, or another type of mint like spearmint if you prefer. Add this in a few drops at a time, as you will only need a small amount to scent and flavor the lip balm, and too much can create a burning sensation. Determine the quantity of ingredients to use based on the size of your container or the amount you\u2019re going to make. If you\u2019re only filling one small lip balm pot or tube, you may only need about a tablespoon."

Scrape off the top of a lipstick you don\u2019t use and add it to your petroleum jelly and mint extract or oil. You can also scrape a small amount of eyeshadow, blush, or another pigmented beauty product into your lip balm to create color. Food coloring or another edible dye will also work to color the lip balm, but note that even one drop will be a very concentrated color if you\u2019re only making a small quantity of lip balm."

Heat for about two minutes, or until completely melted, then stir. Microwaves vary, so use your best judgment when heating your ingredients. It may take more or less time to melt the lip balm, but you want it to be fully liquid so it\u2019s easy to pour. Stir with a wooden chopstick, stir stick, or another utensil that will not melt in the hot liquid and that you can easily dispose of or clean afterwards. Use oven mitts to remove the container from the microwave, and be very careful with the hot contents. Children should have an adult complete this step."

However, too much can actually create a burning sensation on your lips, so add it carefully, especially if you are only making a small batch of lip balm. If you need to test the consistency or amount of mint in the balm, you can transfer a small amount to a piece of wax paper and let it set in the refrigerator. Test it once solidified, and if you need to make adjustments to your main batch, just reheat it before adding anything. At this point, you can also add powder from eyeshadow or blush if you\u2019d like your lip balm to contain a tint of color. Stir it in until combined evenly."
