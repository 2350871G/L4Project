Armatures can be made out of thin or thick gauge wire, plumping pipes, pvc pipe, lumber, sticks, dowels, or any other material that works for you. Generally start with the \"spine\" of the piece and create branches for the \"limbs\". Using your design sketch can be helpful for forming the armature, especially if the sketch was made to-scale. Anchor your armature in or to your base before continuing."

If your sculpture will have a base, it's a good idea to build that first and build the sculpture on the base. The base will be less structurally sound if added later. You can build a base from wood, metal, clay, stone, or any other material you want. Build an armature. \"Armature\" is a word sculptors use that just means \"support structure\".

Reduction Sculpture Make a sculpture sketch. Start by making a clay, wax, or other fast version of your sculpture. This will be used as a \"sketch\". You will take measurements from it and use those to carve the stone or other sculpting material. Carve the basic form. You can take basic measurements from you sculpture and mark the stone or wood where you know it will need to be cut. For example, if you know your sculpture isn't going to be more than 14 inches (35.6 cm) high, you can cut away all material above 15 inches (38.1 cm). Leave some room for movement but certainly carve out the basic shape of your sculpture. Use a pointing machine. Using a pointing machine or other measuring device, begin to measure your sculpture \"sketch\" and make the same locations and depths on your stone or wood. Carve in the details. Using tools appropriate for your material, begin to chip away at the material and even out the points that you made using the pointing machine. Sand down your sculpture. Using gradually finer and finer sandpaper, sand down your sculpture until it is as smooth as you want it to be. Done! Add any final extra details that you want and enjoy your sculpture.",
