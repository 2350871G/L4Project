        "They should point downwards like frowns, not upwards like smiles.",
        "Drawing a web pattern onto all of your components by hand can be a painstaking, time-consuming task.",
        "It\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to bother with it\u2014your finished costume will look just as good without it.",
        "Use puffy fabric paint to lend your webbing some added texture.",
        "Instead of ordinary fabric paint, pick up a bottle of black puffy fabric paint.",
        "This type of paint is designed to expand slightly as it dries, which will give the webbing pattern on your spider suit a dynamic 3D effect.",
        "Heat-set the paint by lightly steaming it with an iron (just don't actually touch it) before you don your costume for the first time.",
        "Depending on the size of your costume and webbing pattern, it may be a good idea to grab a backup bottle of puffy paint in case you run out before you've finished detailing the whole suit.",
        "If you opt for puffy paint, you'll need to be extra careful while wearing your costume.",
        "The paint may be prone to chipping or peeling if you rough it up or get it snagged on something.",
        "Making the Mask and Web Shooters Put together a simple mask using a red ski mask and a pair of goggles.",
        "For a quick, easy, and functional mask just like the one seen in the 2019 film Spider-Man: Far From Home, all you need is a solid red ski mask and a cheap pair of welding goggles, both of which you can buy online for just a few dollars.",
        "Just put on the goggles and slip the mask on over your head!A ski mask made from smooth, stretchy lycra will be more form-fitting than an ordinary knit ski mask.",
        "Make your own mask from scratch using a spandex facemask.",
        "Sketch the shape of the eyepieces onto the mask and cut out the excess material to create the eyeholes.",
        "Then, place a thin piece of white mesh over each eyehole and cut strips of black craft foam to outline them.",
        "Hot-glue the craft foam into place with the mesh sandwiched in between.",
        "This will hide your eyes while allowing you to see out of the mask.",
        "Make sure the facemask you get is completely blank, with no pre-cut openings for the eyes or mouth.",
        "If you just can\u2019t get the mask right, you can always buy a cheap spandex replica mask separately.Tip: You could also pop the lenses out of a pair of reflective sunglasses and glue them around the eyeholes of your mask to give the eyepieces some sleek, modern flair.",
        "Mock up your own pair of web shooters.",
        "Trace the wrist pieces of your web shooters onto a sheet of black or gray craft foam, along with 12-16 3 centimetres (1.2 in) x 2 centimetres (0.79 in) rectangles, which will serve as the wrist straps.",
        "Cut out the pieces and put them all together using hot glue.",
        "Attach Velcro strips to the last rectangle piece on either end so you can fasten your web shooters around your wrists.",
        "To really go above and beyond in terms of detail, snip 2 1 in (2.5 cm) sections from a plastic straw and glue them to the end of each wrist piece to make nozzles for the webbing to escape.",
        "If you\u2019re looking for a slightly simpler web shooter design, cut a length of 1 in (2.5 cm) PVC pipe into 3-8 5.7 cm (2.2 in) segments (depending on whether you want to make 1 or 2 web shooters), spray paint them silver and arrange them around a pair of Velcro wrist straps.",
        "Trying out Different Variations Buy costume components that you can\u2019t create yourself.",
        "If you don\u2019t have the time, materials, or crafting expertise to fashion tricky pieces like the mask or web shooters, there\u2019s no shame in purchasing them from a costume shop or ordering them online from sites like eBay or Amazon.",
        "Your costume will still qualify as handmade even if you throw in a few pre-fab pieces to provide the finishing touches.",
        "Many costume shops sell things like replica masks, gloves, special clothing items, and accessories individually, so you can pick up only the pieces that you need.",
        "Use different colored clothing to make your favorite version of the spider suit.",
        "Spider-Man has had a lot of different looks over the years.",
        "If you want to bring to life one of the wallcrawler\u2019s alternate costumes, it will usually be as easy as picking out your base items in a different color scheme.",
        "You may also need to cut your accessories slightly differently, depending on the exact style you\u2019re going for.",
        "If you\u2019re working on a budget, study many different costume designs and go with one that you think you could pull off using items you already have lying around.",
        "Some versions of the Spider-Man costume are even easier to create than the classic red-and-blue getup.",
        "You could pull off Spider-Man\u2019s symbiote suit with nothing but some black clothes and white fabric paint!",
        "Recreate one of Spider-Man\u2019s homemade costumes to avoid cutting altogether.",
        "Most of the costumes Spider-Man donned early on in his crime-fighting career were cobbled together from ordinary clothing items and other everyday accessories.",
        "If you want to look the part but don\u2019t like the idea of destroying your wardrobe, consider taking the same DIY approach.",
        "As an added bonus, your costume will stand out from the many regular spider suits you see at cons and cosplay events.",
        "\"Vigilante Spider-Man\" from the film Spider-Man: Homecoming wears only a blue shirt, blue pants, a sleeveless red hoodie, red sneakers, fingerless gloves, and a red balaclava with welding goggles.",
        "Similarly, Scarlet Spider\u2019s costume is comprised of only a red bodysuit and a sleeveless blue hoodie.Tip: If you really want to cement your status as a die-hard Spider-Man fan, try replicating his very first homemade costume from the August, 1962 issue of Amazing Fantasy: blue trousers, a white sweatshirt, and a gray mask covered in webbing designs."
