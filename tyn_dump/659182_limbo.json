The most popular song choice is \u201cLimbo Rock\u201d by Chubby Checker, but any island-themed music is appropriate. Playing Classic Limbo Have players bend backwards and go under the stick without touching it. The goal of limbo is to successfully pass underneath the stick without letting it touch any part of your body. Players cannot crouch, duck, or crawl to pass under, meaning they have to bend backwards to get beneath the pole. For older groups looking for a challenge, try adding additional rules like \u201cYour hands cannot touch the ground\u201d or \u201cYour hands must stay behind your back.\u201d Lower the stick and start a new round. After everyone has had a turn, lower the stick by 2 to 3 in (5.1 to 7.6 cm) or however much seems appropriate for your group. Then, have everyone pass under again. As the game continues, it will get harder and harder to pass underneath the pole. Disqualify a player if they fall over or touch the stick. In traditional limbo rules, a player is out if they touch the pole in any way or can\u2019t keep their balance.

Moving the pole to its previous height and having players pass under it until someone messes up. Trying Limbo Variations Use a water hose as a pole on hot days. Hook your hose up to a water faucet and turn it on. Hold your thumb over the hose opening to create a stream of water. As with normal limbo, have players pass under the water, disqualifying players that get wet. Use a flashlight as a pole so you can play in the dark. Turn on your flashlight and hold it horizontally, creating a beam of light. Have everyone pass under the beam, disqualifying players that touch the light.
