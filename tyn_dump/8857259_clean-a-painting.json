The ideal brush size for cleaning dust is 3.5 to 5 centimetres (1.4 to 2.0 in). You can use brush cleaning for oil, acrylic, and watercolor. You can attempt to clean pastels using the brush method, but you may damage the artwork, as pastels are easily altered. For oil and pastel paintings, choose a brush labeled for oil painting. For acrylic paintings, choose a brush labeled for acrylic paintings. For watercolor paintings, use a watercolor brush. It's especially important that the brush be dry. Never use dust cloths, feather dusters, or stiff-bristles to clean a painting. Even a soft cloth or duster can damage the painting."

        "Make sure that the saliva didn\u2019t alter the paint in any way.",
        "For example, it shouldn\u2019t be flaking and shouldn\u2019t have marks on it.",
        "Check that the dust and debris are gone.",
        "Dip a cotton swab in the saliva, then wipe away dirt and dust.",
        "Make small, gentle swipes along the surface of the painting.",
        "The cotton should barely touch the surface of the painting, as you don\u2019t want to leave an impression.",
        "If any dirt and dust remain, you can make a second pass.",
        "Continue to use gentle pressure.",
        "You\u2019ll need to have a lot of patience, as the cleaning process can take a lot of time.",
        "Work in 1 inch (2.5 cm) sections until the entire painting is clean.",
        "Focusing on small sections at a time will help you make sure that you successfully clean the entire painting.",
        "It will also help you avoid becoming overwhelmed.",
        "You can adjust the size of your sections, if you need to.",
        "For example, you might want to work in very small sections if the painting is very dirty.",
        "Use both ends of the cotton swab, then get a new swab.",
        "When a cotton swab starts to look dirty, you need to switch to a clean swab.",
        "Expect to go through many cotton swabs as you clean the painting.",
        "It\u2019s best to start with a full or mostly full box of cotton swabs.",
        "You won\u2019t use all of them, but you\u2019ll be sure that you have enough.",
        "Hiring a Professional Conservator Obtain art insurance on the piece before getting it cleaned.",
        "In the unlikely event that your painting is damaged by the conservator, insurance will protect you from financial loss.",
        "You can add fine art insurance onto your homeowner's policy, or you can take out a policy from a company specializing in fine art insurance.",
        "They'll ask for proof that the art work is yours, and then you'll need to get an appraisal to estimate the current value of the work.",
        "You can prove ownership with a bill of sale or other legal documents.",
        "You should get your artwork appraised every 3-5 years to make sure your policy reflects its current value.",
        "Insurance can also cover your painting during transportation.",
        "Just check with your insurer to make sure your policy offers this coverage.",
        "Take valuable, notable, or older pieces to a professional conservator.",
        "Although getting a painting cleaned by a professional conservator can be pricey, it can save you a lot of heartache if the painting needs special attention.",
        "It\u2019s easy to damage a painting, especially if it\u2019s already old.",
        "A professional conservator is trained in the best practices for preserving and cleaning artwork, which limits the risk of harm.",
        "For example, if you own an expensive original painting from a famous artist, it\u2019s best to get it professionally cleaned.",
        "Similarly, you'll need to hire a conservationist if your watercolor painting has damage other than dust.",
        "For example, they can remove mold from the painting.",
        "Keep in mind that an art conservator is different from an artist or a curator.",
        "Don\u2019t turn your painting over to anyone without properly checking their credentials.",
        "Contact the nearest art museum or art school to get a referral.",
        "An art museum or art school should be able to put you in contact with a qualified conservator.",
        "In some cases, the person may work at the museum or school, preserving the artwork in their holdings.",
        "Going through a museum or art school will give you confidence that the person knows what they\u2019re doing.",
        "If you don\u2019t know of any art museums nearby, do an Internet search.",
        "You can also do a simple search for art conservators.",
        "Select a conservator experienced with the type of painting you possess.",
        "Ask them about their education, work history, and specializations.",
        "Then, look at examples of their past work.",
        "Ideally, they should have experience in handling artwork from a similar time period to yours and in the same medium.",
        "For example, you wouldn\u2019t want to have a classical Renaissance painting restored by someone who only has experience working with contemporary art.",
        "Allow the conservator to evaluate the painting and create a plan.",
        "Each painting has its own issues, so every professional cleaning process will be different.",
        "The conservator will evaluate the quality of the paint, existing damage, and the presence of varnish that may be protecting the paint.",
        "They can also determine if prior restoration efforts have been done.",
        "After their evaluation, they\u2019ll provide you with a restoration plan.",
        "In many cases, they will look at the paint under a UV light to check the varnish and paint layers.",
        "At the very least, the conservator will remove debris.",
        "It\u2019s likely that they will also remove the top layer of varnish.",
        "If the painting has other damage, such as tears or flaking paint, the conservator will repair these, as well.",
        "They may even touch up the paint, with your approval.",
        "Ask the conservator to get approval from you before they begin.",
        "This can protect you from unwanted changes or a high bill.",
        "Have them explain what they want to do to your painting, such as removing the varnish or touching up paint.",
        "Next, check the proposed fee.",
        "Make sure that you are happy with everything before you approve the plan.",
        "If a painting needs minimal cleaning, conservation may cost a few hundred dollars.",
        "If it requires more work, costs for a small painting may range from $800-$1,000.",
        "A larger painting that has damage may cost as much as $10,000-$15,000 to conserve and restore.",
        "Most conservationists are paid by the hour and will not disclose costs until they can evaluate a painting.",
        "Additionally, x-rays of the painting add to the cost.",
        "Get everything in writing.",
        "If any changes are made, make sure they are noted in the agreement and you both sign off."
