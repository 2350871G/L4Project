If you want to do this experiment on a larger scale, use a metal bucket instead. You might also benefit from having a pencil and paper to record your results. Cut your aluminum can. Cut off the top portion of the lid. For a clean cut, use a can opener. Be gentle and take your time or else you may have sharp aluminum protruding out. Complete the experiment on a day when temperatures are above freezing. Check the weather forecast before starting the experiment. To accurately measure dew point, instead of frost point, the temperature should be above freezing. Aim for 60 \u00b0F (16 \u00b0C) weather for best results. You can still proceed with your experiment if the weather is colder or warmer. Performing the Experiment Fill the can with warm water. Take your can or bucket and fill it three-quarters of the way full with warm tap water. Use tap water with a temperature of about 85 \u00b0F (29 \u00b0C)). Place the thermometer into the aluminum can. Fill a separate container with ice and water. Any glass or cup will do. Fill the cup with ice, then add water to it. Note that you don\u2019t want to add ice directly to the cup of warm water. Transfer your supplies to an outdoor location. Bring all your supplies to the location where you plan to conduct the experiment. Be careful not to spill any of the liquids or break the thermometer. Record the starting temperature. When conducting scientific experiments and measurements, it\u2019s best to record the starting temperature. Look at the thermometer in the cup and jot down the starting temperature and time.
