Keep your car in park with the handbrake on while you check the transmission fluid. Note that some vehicles are checked in the neutral position. Reference your owner's manual for the proper position of your car's shifter. If you've just finished driving your car for 30 minutes or longer, it's a good idea to let your engine idle a few minutes before you check the trans fluid. This will allow the temperature of the fluid to normalize. Note that some cars may also have a \"cold\" reading on the transmission dipstick. Even if this is the case in your vehicle, you should still start your engine and get the transmission fluid heated up in order to get an accurate reading."
