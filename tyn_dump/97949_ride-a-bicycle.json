A good place to start is a flat, smooth stretch of ground such as your driveway or your sidewalk. Those who don\u2019t have space at home can practice in a parking lot or park. Starting off on grass or smooth gravel helps since falls there hurt less. These surfaces make balancing and pedaling harder though. If you plan on practicing balance and pedaling on hills, find locations with gentle slopes. Check your local laws to see if it is legal to ride on sidewalks or other paths."

Long-sleeved shirts and long pants also help protect against falls and can be combined with pads. Avoid baggy pants and long skirts.

A broken bone can usually be fixed, but head trauma, common in bicycle accidents, leaves a lasting impact. Also, some areas have laws requiring riders to wear helmets. Helmets are measured to fit the head. A good one fits tightly and comes down to an inch (two and a half centimeters) above your eyebrows. It will also have straps that keep your helmet tight while still letting you move your mouth. Commuter helmets are one common type. They are rounded, made of foam and plastic, and can be found online or in retail stores where bikes are available. Road helmets are elongated and often have vents. They\u2019re also made with foam and plastic but are popular on roads or in competitive racing. Seek them online or in retail stores. Youth (age 10-15), child (age 5-10), and toddler (under 5) helmets are all smaller commuter or road helmets. Toddler helmets are the only ones with more foam. Mountain bike helmets and professional sports helmets come with visors and neck bracing for tough off-road conditions."

Once you\u2019ve learned this, you\u2019ll feel more comfortable because you\u2019ll be able to make an emergency stop when needed. If your bike has brakes on the handlebars, test each one to see which controls the front and which controls the rear wheel. These can be switched by professionals. Notice how squeezing the back brake causes the rear wheel to skid. Squeezing the front brake causes the bike to pitch forward. If your bike doesn\u2019t have brakes on the handles, it should have backpedal (coaster) brakes. To brake, press down on the pedal closest to the back end of the bike as if pedaling backwards. If your bike is a fixed wheel and hasn\u2019t been modified, it has no brakes. Instead of braking, you will need to either slow the pace of your pedaling or skid by leaning forward and holding both pedals horizontally with your feet."

Hold the bike upwards between your legs. Feel the weight of the bike between your legs and try to keep it balanced as you lower yourself.
