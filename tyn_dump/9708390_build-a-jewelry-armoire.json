You need to decide on the exact shape and size you want this box to be. If you have plenty of space for it, a good general size for a jewelry armoire is 1 foot (0.30 m) wide, 3 feet (0.91 m) tall, and 6 inches (15 cm) deep. This will fit quite a lot of jewelry without being overwhelming in size. Remember, the bigger your armoire is, the more expensive it will be for the materials."
