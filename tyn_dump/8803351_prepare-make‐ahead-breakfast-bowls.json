If you have not yet already, soak the quinoa for 1 hour. Drain it, then rinse it off. Place the quinoa and other ingredients into a saucepan.

Preparing Roasted Potato and Egg Bowls Preheat your oven to 425\u00b0F (219\u00b0C).  Prepare the vegetables. Wash the potatoes and peppers, then peel the potatoes and onions.
