Or do you want to make it informative? Decide between making an art project or a science project so you know what leaves to look for, how many you'll need, and whether you want to include stems or just the leaves themselves. For a science project, you could try to collect a leaf from every type of tree that grows in your area. Or you can try to find find leaves from different individual trees of the same type to show the difference between the size of a sapling's leaves versus a full grown tree's. For an art project, you can a landscape with leaves standing in for trees, with the leaf's stem standing in for a trunk. You could also make a wreath with lots of layers and differently colored leaves. For a landscape, you only need a few. For a wreath, the more the better!

        "She is a 12 year blogging veteran who loves making crafting and DIY as easy as possible for others, with a focus on mindfulness in making.",
        "EXPERT ADVICE\t\t\t\tClaire Donovan-Blackwood, the owner of Heart Handmade UK, responded: \u201cStart by gathering different types of leaves.",
        "If you want a flat collage, dry the leaves between two paper towels in the pages of a super heavy book.",
        "Put a heavy object on top and leave it.",
        "When the leaves are dry, use a water-based glue like Mod Podge to arrange and secure the leaves.\u201d Pick your craft materials.",
        "There\u2019s no one way to make a leaf collage, so explore your options!",
        "Choose whatever you think would be prettiest, easiest, and/or the least messy to work with.",
        "You can use:\nColored or plain white backing paper\nCardboard or foam backing board\nContact paper\nPens, colored pencils, markers, etc.",
        "Various forms of glue Gluing a Collage Choose your backing paper.",
        "Leaves and glue may not seem heavy on their own, but together they\u2019ll add some weight to your paper.",
        "So opt for something thicker than notebook sheets or printer paper.",
        "Choose between:\nCraft paper\nCardboard, new or used\nColored construction paper\nFoam backing board Decide on a design.",
        "Before you start gluing leaves in place, know exactly where you want them so you don\u2019t second-guess yourself after it\u2019s too late to move them!",
        "Lay your backing paper down and arrange your leaves however you please.",
        "You could try:\nGrouping them by the type of tree they came from.",
        "Creating a wreath.",
        "Making a landscape with leaves standing in for trees.",
        "Color in your background if you like.",
        "If you only have plain craft paper or cardboard to work with as backing, consider sprucing them up by painting them or adding other touches of color before you begin gluing.",
        "Or, even if you\u2019re using colored construction paper or backing boards, think of other elements that you may want to include behind your leaves.",
        "For instance:\nIf you\u2019re making a wreath, you can trim sheets of other colored paper (or use crayons or markers to color in plain white paper) into thin strips.",
        "Arrange these like sunbeams pointing outward from where your leaves will go and then glue them into place.",
        "If you\u2019re making a landscape, you can draw other features in the background, like buildings, mountains, or a setting sun.",
        "Glue your leaves to the backing paper.",
        "Once you have touched up your background, attach your leaves to the paper.",
        "First, decide between using liquid glue or a glue stick.",
        "Then stick each leaf to the paper.",
        "If you\u2019re using liquid glue, apply a thin bead around the back of your leaf.",
        "Keep a little distance between the glue and the leaf\u2019s edges.",
        "This way the glue won\u2019t squirt out from underneath when you stick it to the paper.",
        "A glue stick can be a neater alternative, since it\u2019s transparent and won\u2019t goop up anywhere.",
        "Rub it onto the back of the leaf, the paper itself, or both, and then press the two together.",
        "Add some finishing touches.",
        "This isn\u2019t a must, so if you\u2019re happy with your collage as it is, feel free to call it day!",
        "But there\u2019s plenty you could do to spruce your collage up even more.",
        "For instance:\nIf you\u2019ve grouped your leaves together by type, consider labeling.",
        "You can use pens or markers to write the type of tree directly on the backing paper where there\u2019s room.",
        "Or you can glue separate labels written on a different colored paper so they\u2019ll stand out even more.",
        "If you\u2019ve made a landscape, you can still draw in features like grass, clouds, or the sun or moon where space allows.",
        "You can even glue other materials to the backing paper for these, like green yarn for grass or cotton balls for clouds.",
        "You could also apply spray-on glue to the whole thing once you\u2019re finished.",
        "This will help preserve the leaves\u2019 original shapes and colors.",
        "Glitter, stickers, and similar materials can also be added to make your collage even more eye-catching.",
        "Using Contact Paper Decide how to use it.",
        "Contact paper comes in transparent sheets, each with a sticky adhesive side.",
        "This makes it a great protective cover for flat collages, plus it can also be used instead of glue!",
        "You can either use it to:\nSeal a finished glued collage.",
        "Stick leaves and other materials directly to it.",
        "Create a collage that\u2019s totally transparent except for the leaves.",
        "Seal glued collages.",
        "Give your glue time to dry once you\u2019re finished attaching everything to the backing paper.",
        "In the meantime, use scissors to trim your contact paper to match the backing paper\u2019s size.",
        "Once the glued materials feel firmly in place, remove the backing to the contact paper\u2019s sticky side.",
        "Lay the contact paper facedown, with the sticky side up.",
        "Then line up your backing paper with its edges and press the two together, with your leaves sandwiched in between.",
        "This is only a good idea for flat collages.",
        "If you\u2019re using stuff like cotton balls and yarns, or if you like the way your leaves curl, this would only flatten them out and ruin the effect.",
        "Use contact paper instead of glue.",
        "First, lay out your backing paper and decide on your design.",
        "Because contact paper is so sticky, correcting mistakes will be even more difficult than with glue, so definitely take the time to figure out how you want to arrange your leaves before you begin.",
        "You\u2019re also going to use the contact paper\u2019s sticky side to fix your backing paper in place, so leave the edges clear so the two connect.",
        "Once you\u2019re satisfied:\nPeel off the backing to the contact paper\u2019s sticky side and lay the paper down with the sticky side facing up.",
        "Take a leaf from your backing paper and press it facedown into the contact paper\u2019s sticky side.",
        "Because the contact paper is facedown, remember that sides are reversed.",
        "For example, if your backing paper and contact paper are side-by-side, the leaf that\u2019s lying faceup all the way to the right of your backing paper should be placed facedown all the way to the left of your contact paper.",
        "Continue sticking leaves (and any other materials) one at a time so you don\u2019t lose track of which goes where.",
        "When you\u2019re finished, flip the backing paper over, line its edges up with the contact paper\u2019s, and press the two together.",
        "Make a transparent collage.",
        "Say you know exactly where you want to hang your collage, but instead of obscuring the wall with backing paper, you want your leaves to accent the wall itself.",
        "In that case, use two sheets of contact paper: one for the front, the other for the back, with the sticky sides facing each other.",
        "To do this:\nUse two sheets of contact paper of equal size, trimming one to match the other if needed.",
        "Arrange your leaves on any surface to settle on a design.",
        "Again, contact paper is pretty sticky, and removing your leaves once they\u2019re in place will be pretty tough.",
        "Remove the backing to one sheet of contact paper.",
        "Lay that sheet facedown, with the sticky side up.",
        "Stick the back of each leaf, one by one, to the contact paper, following your design exactly.",
        "Once you\u2019re all done, remove the backing to the other sheet of contact paper.",
        "Line their edges up and press the two together, with the leaves sandwiched between the two sticky sides."
