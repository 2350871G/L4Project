If inside, make sure a door or window is open so dust particles can escape. Slicing Fabric Place the cloth on a hard table. Stretch your sheet of fiberglass out over a hard, flat working table. Make sure the area is clear of any debris, including small things like pencil shavings and dust. If your fabric is still on a roll, pull out only the amount you plan on cutting. Pull out fabric strands along the cutting edge until one lasts the length of the sheet. If your fiberglass has been cut previously, the bottom edge will have some light fraying on it.

        "Make sure the tape extends at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) beyond the spot in question.",
        "Mark the tape with a cutting line.",
        "Use a small pencil to mark the line where you intend to cut.",
        "Because the panel is covered with tape, double check to make sure the line is accurate and matches all your measurements.",
        "Line up a hacksaw with the marked line.",
        "Place the back edge of a fine-toothed hacksaw blade directly against your cutting line.",
        "To make sure you don't get injured, hold the saw so its handle is pointed toward yourself, protecting your body from the blade.",
        "Pull the hacksaw back and forth to make the cut.",
        "In slow, steady motions, pull the hacksaw toward and away from yourself to saw through the fiberglass.",
        "This may take some time, since the hacksaw is a manual tool.",
        "To make sure the panel is cut cleanly, do not rush the process."
