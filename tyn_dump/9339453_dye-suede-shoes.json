Once the waterproofing has dried completely (which could take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour), you\u2019ll be able to model your new shoes with confidence. Aim for full coverage from heel to toe, but avoid oversaturating the suede.

Once safely inside the bag, the shoes should find their way to the top shelf of your closet or another cool, dry place where they're unlikely to encounter any messes. Leave the mouth of the bag slightly open, or take the shoes out periodically to give them a chance to breathe. With a dust bag, you won't run the risk of drying out the suede or trapping unwanted moisture when the shoes remain in storage for long periods of time, unlike a lidded shoebox or sealed plastic bag. Consider investing in a shoe tree. Shoe trees allow footwear to be hung up on \"branches\" that are similar in dimension to feet, so they'll always retain their shape and can easily be moved in and out of storage. For added security, a dust bag or pillowcase can be slid directly over the entire shoe tree."

        "Try not to layer on too many coats, as too much dye can eventually dry out the leather.",
        "Protecting the New Finish Buff the shoes to touch up the suede.",
        "Once again, go over the surface with the shoe brush to fluff up the nap that\u2019s been weighed down by the dye.",
        "It may help to waft a hairdryer over the shoes while you do this to make sure every last fiber is completely dry.",
        "If you\u2019re using the same brush as before, clean it thoroughly with warm soapy water or acetone to strip the remaining dye before putting it to work again.",
        "Treat the shoes with a waterproofing spray.",
        "A quality silicone or acrylic waterproofer will help preserve the updated color.",
        "Hold the can 6\u20138 inches (15\u201320 cm) away from the shoe and mist on a light, even coating.",
        "Once the waterproofing has dried completely (which could take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour), you\u2019ll be able to model your new shoes with confidence.",
        "Aim for full coverage from heel to toe, but avoid oversaturating the suede.",
        "The clear, odorless waterproofing agent works by filling in the tiny gaps in the soft fabric, creating a barrier that repels water.",
        "Clean your dyed shoes carefully.",
        "Brush out the suede every once in a while to dislodge clinging debris.",
        "To deal with stains and buildup from other substances like mud, it's best to lightly scrub the suede with a modest amount of water, as you did with your preliminary cleaning.",
        "The wisest course of action, however, is to keep them from getting dirty in the first place.",
        "Excessive moisture could simply spread the stain around, or worse, cause the dye to bleed.",
        "Avoid wearing the shoes in wet conditions.",
        "Even with the waterproofing spray, the dye will be prone to running when exposed to moisture.",
        "Save your refurbished footwear for clear days, and do your best to steer clear of puddles, sprinklers, wet grass, and other watery pitfalls.",
        "When worn cautiously, you can get many more years of use out of your favorite shoes.",
        "Dyed athletic shoes could become blotchy or faded after a few sweaty workouts.",
        "It may be a good idea to keep a spare change of shoes with you if the forecast is calling for rain.",
        "Store your dyed shoes somewhere with good ventilation.",
        "Pick up a drawstring dust bag and make it a point to keep your shoes in it when you're not wearing them.",
        "Once safely inside the bag, the shoes should find their way to the top shelf of your closet or another cool, dry place where they're unlikely to encounter any messes.",
        "Leave the mouth of the bag slightly open, or take the shoes out periodically to give them a chance to breathe.",
        "With a dust bag, you won't run the risk of drying out the suede or trapping unwanted moisture when the shoes remain in storage for long periods of time, unlike a lidded shoebox or sealed plastic bag.",
        "Consider investing in a shoe tree.",
        "Shoe trees allow footwear to be hung up on \"branches\" that are similar in dimension to feet, so they'll always retain their shape and can easily be moved in and out of storage.",
        "For added security, a dust bag or pillowcase can be slid directly over the entire shoe tree."
