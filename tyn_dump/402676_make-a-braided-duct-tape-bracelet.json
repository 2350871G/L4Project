Duct tape comes in many different patterns, so that is an option too. You will need 1 roll of duct tape for each color/pattern that you will be using. If you'll be using the same color for all 3 strands, then you only need 1 roll of duct tape in that color. Some craft stores sell narrower strips of duct tape. Avoid using these, as they will be too difficult to work with. Cut a 14 in (36 cm) strip of each color you will be using. You will be cutting these strips into narrower strands. For example, if you will be using the same color for all 3 strands, then you only need to cut one 14 in (36 cm) strip. Set the strips of duct tape on your stable, sticky-side-up so that they are ready for the next step. Fold each strip in half lengthwise to make it narrower. Lay down your strips with the sticky side facing up. Fold the strips in half lengthwise so that the colored side is facing out. Try to avoid wrinkles and air bubbles as much as possible. Cut 3 thin strips from your duct tape, using the threads as a guide. If you look closely at duct tape, you'll notice that it has horizontal and vertical threads running through it. Cut the tape into narrow strips with scissors using the long, vertical threads as guides. Something between \u20448 to \u20444 inch (0.32 to 0.64 cm) wide will work the best, but make sure they are all the same width. If you are making a 3-color bracelet, cut 1 strip from each color. If you are making a single-color bracelet, cut all 3 strips from the same color. Tape the ends to your desk, side-by-side. Arrange all 3 strips on a flat surface so that the long edges are touching. Cover the ends with a short piece of duct tape. You are now rest to start braiding! Do not stack the pieces together. You need to see all 3 strips. Cover the first 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the ends with the short piece of duct tape. Doing a Basic 3-Strand Braid Cross the left strand over the middle strand. Take the strand that is on the left. Cross it over the middle strand, making sure that it does not twist. This is now your new middle strand. Cross the right strand over the new middle strand. Take the strand that's on the right. Bring it over the new middle strand. Again, make sure that it does not twist. This is now the newest middle strand. Repeat these steps until it's loose enough to wrap around your wrist. Continue to cross the left and right strands over the middle strand. Don't let the strands get twisted or wrinkled. Stop once the braid is loose enough to wrap around your wrist. If the strands start to wrinkle, you are braiding too tightly. Tape the end of the braid with a short piece of duct tape. Make sure that the leftover strips at the end of your braid are arranged side-by-side, just like in the beginning. Place the strip of duct tape over the strips, right where you finished braiding. You my have excess duct tape strips sticking out from under the short piece of duct tape, which is fine. Finishing the Bracelet Peel the bracelet off your desk and trim the rest off. Carefully peel the pieces of duct tape off of your desk. Do not peel them off of the braid, however. Trim the leftover strips of duct tape as close to the tape as possible. Click here if you'd like to make a magnetic closure instead. Fold the duct tape pieces over onto the back of the braid. Flip the braid over so that you can see the sticky side of the little duct tape pieces. Fold the duct tape over so that you can't see the sticky side any more. Make sure that the folded edge is aligned with the side of the braid. Don't let the ends overlap. Keep them flat and side-by-side. Trim the excess duct tape off of the side edge so that it's aligned with the braid. Cut both taped ends so that they are 1 inch (2.5 cm) long. The taped ends of your braid are probably 2 inches (5.1 cm) long, which is the standard width of duct tape. Take a pair of scissors, and cut them so that they are 1 inch (2.5 cm) long instead. Overlap the ends by 1 inch (2.5 cm) and tape them. Cut a 1 in (2.5 cm) wide strip of duct tape. Bring the ends of the bracelet together and overlap them by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Wrap the short strip of duct tape around them to hold the bracelet together. Don't let the braid twist when doing this. If the bracelet is too small to slide on and off, put the bracelet on before you tape it. Adding a Magnetic Closure Get a pair of \u20444 in (6.4 mm) silver neodymium magnets. You can find these magnets in the magnet section of a hardware store or a craft store. They are typically sold in packs of 6 or 8. If you cannot find any, get a set of magnetic jewelry clasps from the beading section of a craft store instead. You can use smaller magnets too, but don't use larger ones.

Go to the end of your braid. Cut 1 side of the duct tape as close to the braid's side edge as possible. Wrap the other end of the tape around the braid, rolling it into a tight rope. Repeat this step for the other end of the braid. Do not keep the ends of the braid flat. Cut the taped ends down to 1 inch (2.5 cm). This will leave little holes at each end of your braid. These will create little tubes or pockets for the magnets to fit into. Cut 4 thin strips of duct tape and make 2 Xs. Cut 4 strips of duct tape that are \u20444 inch (0.64 cm) wide and 2 inches (5.1 cm) long. Take 2 of those strips, and cross them to make an X-shape. Repeat this step for the second set of strips. These will create holders for the magnets. Place the magnets against the middle of each X. Stick the magnets together first, then make a dot on the outside of each magnet with a marker. Pry the magnets apart, then press them against the sticky side of each X, marked-side-down. If you are using jewelry clasps, simply place the flat, magnetic end of each clasp against the sticky side of each X. Secure the Xs over each end of the bracelet, with the magnets inside. Take the first X, and turn it so that the magnet is inside the tube. Fold the arms of the X down onto the taped end of the bracelet. Repeat this step for the other X and the other end of the bracelet. Wrap 1 in (2.5 cm) strips of duct tape around each end of the bracelet. Cut 2 pieces of duct tape that are 1 in (2.5 cm) wide.
