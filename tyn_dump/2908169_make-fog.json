Always handle dry ice with insulated gloves and tongs. Watch the fog form. The extremely cold temperature of dry ice will have an immediate reaction to the hot water, causing a thick cloud of fog to form. The rising steam of the hot water, together with the melting ice, creates the effect of fog. Control the direction of the fog with a small electric fan. Because fog will naturally be heavier than air, most of the fog will sink to the floor or ground unless you force it to rise with the fan. Add more dry ice as needed. Every 15 minutes or so, you'll need to add more dry ice to consistently maintain the fog effect. Smaller pieces of dry ice added to the water will maintain greater fog volume over time, rather than larger pieces that will great large bursts of fog. Try using a hot plate to keep your water from cooling off, or refresh with hot water from your kitchen. Be aware that water is likely to bubble out from the reaction of the dry ice and water. If you're making fog indoors, know that the floor is likely to become slippery wherever the fog is. Creating Fog with a Fog Machine Go to a hardware store for supplies. You'll need a few basic supplies to build your own fog machine. These supplies should be available at most hardware stores, and are not expensive. Unless you plan to keep your fog machine for a long time, most of these items can be repurposed for other projects. The items you'll need include:\nA 2-foot, 6-inch round sheet metal ductwork pipe. This is also known as a stove pipe, and this will be the container that you make your fog inside. A 25-foot length of 1/4-inch copper refrigerator tubing\nA 50-foot length of 3/8-inch copper refrigerator tubing\nA 12-foot length of 3/8-inch clear plastic tubing\nA 2-foot length of 1-1/2 inch pipe (used as a form, then discarded)\nA 2-foot length of 3-inch ABS plastic pipe (used as a form, then discarded)\n4 pipe clamps for the 3/8\" Clear plastic tubing\n1\tsmall submersible pump (80 gal/hour)\nA package of plastic wire ties\nAn ice chest or bucket Create two soft copper coils. One coil should have a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) and the other coil should have a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). Form the coils by tightly winding soft copper refrigerator tubing around a piece of PVC pipe. You should be able to wind the copper tubing around the pipes using your hands, but if you have difficulty grasping it, you could grab the tubing using pliers. To create the inner coil, wind the 25 foot (7.6 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). To create the outer coil, wind the 50 feet (15.24 m) copper tubing around a 2 foot (0.61 m) (61 cm) long pipe with a diameter of 3 inches (7.6 cm). Slide the coils out of their respective tubes once created. Place the smaller coil into the larger coil. Slide the smaller coil directly inside the larger coil and secure it in place by using small wire ties. This allows the fog to pass in and around the coils, which provides the best cooling. If tying the smaller coil in place is too difficult, you can just allow the small coil to lay against the bottom of the larger one. Because the coils will need to fit inside the stove pipe, stretch them out until they roughly match the length of the pipe. Place both coils into a stovepipe. Slide the larger coil into your stovepipe, using wire ties to hold both coils in place. The goal is to have the two coils as close to the center as possible inside the larger pipe. Hanging the coils in this way allows the fog to pass in and around the coils and cool it even better. The machine will work without using the ties, but it won't work as well. Connect the coils. At one end of the chiller, connect the ends of the inner and outer coils using short pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps. You'll need to connect the ends of the coils on the other side of the chiller to a small submersible pump using longer pieces of plastic tubing and pipe clamps. Cold water will come from the pump, and circulate through the coils. Submerse the pump in an ice chest full of ice water. The pump should be completely submerged and there should be room for a small commercial fog machine to sit beside it. The water needs to be ice cold in order for the mechanism to work, so you may need to wait 30 minutes or so after dumping the ice in the water before you can create the cold fog. Place your fog machine into the other end of the ice chest. The spout should face outward. Turn on your pump. After a minute or so, cold water should circle through the copper tubing. Test the temperature of the copper by touching it. You should be able to feel the cold water through the sides of the copper. Follow by turning on your fog machine. Fill the fog machine with commercial fog juice and switch it on. Fog should roll out, but instead of floating up as hot fog does, it should sink to the floor thanks to the cooling mechanism.",
