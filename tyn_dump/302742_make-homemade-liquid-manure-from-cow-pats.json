Always create a barrier between your skin and the manure, to prevent the transfer of human pathogens. If you have immunity problems, you're pregnant, or unwell, do not handle at all and if you are concerned about inhaling pathogens, wear a mask as well. Place the container out of the way. The smell will be unpleasant to passers-by and it should be put away somewhere inoffensive such as a back shed or the back of the garden. Ensure that pets and children cannot get access to it. Tell other family members what you're doing and which container you're using so they don't gross out or make mistakes touching it, etc! Hessian or net bag method (anaerobic) Gather some completely sun-dried cow pats. They should not be odorous and be completely dried out either from sunshine drying in the paddock or because you've purposefully strung them out to dry somewhere in the yard. Do not make this using liquid pats! Break the manure pats down into smaller pieces.  Place the pieces into a net bag or a hessian sack. The types of bags used for selling onions or oranges are ideal, provided they are large. Pack down well and fill it to the top. Hang this bag in a large garbage bin that is filled with water. Put the lid on to discourage flies and other unwanted visitors. Leave the bag there for three weeks. This will allow ample time for the manure to break down and be distributed through the water. During this time, dunk the bag up and down gently regularly to help distribute the contents as they break down. Use the liquid. Once the three weeks have passed, use the liquid fertiliser on your plants. It must be diluted first -  the dilution should be nine parts water to one part liquid manure. This fertiliser is suitable for most plants, even seedlings, provided it is diluted. Another anaerobic method Use a drum, bucket, or other suitable container. It must have a lid or a makeshift lid. Place the dried-out cow manure (or fish waste) into the container. Place in to about one-third of the container's height. Fill the rest of the container with water.  Cover the container. This keeps out the flies and other pests. Stir the mixture once every three days. Or, stir once a day for the first three days and then only stir weekly. Leave until the smell dissipates. Once it doesn't smell anymore, it is ready for use. The odor may be smelly over the container itself but the ammonium odor should be completely gone. If not, leave longer until it has gone. Use. The liquid manure so made must be diluted before use. Place into a watering can, spray bottle, or in a dripper system. The application depends on the plants and their needs:\nHeavy feeders need more.
