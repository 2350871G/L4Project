        "Avoid overfeeding the koi and overstocking the pond, and change the water gradually if necessary.",
        "If you need to change the water in the pond, do it in amounts of 10% to 20% of the total volume.",
        "Otherwise, the fish may go into shock.",
        "Keep the temperature of the pond around 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C).",
        "Measure the temperature of the pond regularly with a thermometer.",
        "Use a pond heater as well as an aerator if necessary.",
        "If you find that the pond is getting too warm, very gradually add cold water to slowly reduce the temperature in the pond.",
        "Koi can survive in water that is 34\u201390 \u00b0F (1\u201332 \u00b0C), but they do best at 65 \u00b0F (18 \u00b0C).",
        "Never change the water temperature of the pond all at once, as this can cause the koi to go into shock which can be deadly.",
        "Installing Equipment and Adding Koi Install a filtration system into the koi fish pond.",
        "Purchase a filtration system from a pond equipment supplier and follow the installation directions closely.",
        "All pond filtration systems involve a bottom drain, a settling chamber, mechanical filtration, and biological processing.",
        "This keeps the pond clean and the water quality high so that the koi stay healthy.",
        "Set up the filtration system box right next to the koi pond.",
        "Dig it into the ground slightly.",
        "Install the individual parts in the pond as per the installation directions.",
        "The settling chamber makes it easy for you to remove debris from the pond to keep it clean.",
        "An ideal settling chamber size for koi fish ponds is 40 in (1.0 m) deep and 40 in (1.0 m) in diameter.",
        "The mechanical filtration part of the system will catch debris as it floats through the water.",
        "Biological filtration is the addition of beneficial bacteria into the pond.",
        "This reduces the levels of ammonia and nitrite in the water which are toxic for koi.",
        "Place an aerator in the pond.",
        "A pond aerator will keep the pond water moving at all times.",
        "This keeps the water stirring, oxygenates the pond, and promotes gas exchange.",
        "It also prevents the pond water from freezing during colder months.",
        "A pond aerator is an ideal and economical substitute for a pond heater.",
        "The size of the pond aerator that you need depends on the size of your koi pond.",
        "Know the volume, shape, and depth of your koi pond before you purchase an aerator and choose one that is designed for the size of your koi pond.",
        "Turn on the filtration system and aerator.",
        "Once your pond is full of water, start preparing the water for the koi by getting the filtration system and aerator up and running.",
        "Always do this before adding the koi to the pond.",
        "Put the koi into the pond once it is set up.",
        "Keep the koi in the water and in the plastic bag that they were purchased in.",
        "Float the plastic bag in your koi pond for 30 minutes so that they can adjust to the temperature change.",
        "Then add a bit of pond water into the plastic bag, tie it up, and let it float for an additional 30 minutes to help the koi adjust to the pond water.",
        "After the koi have been given time to adjust, open the plastic bag again and release them into their new pond.",
        "Don't let the plastic bag float continuously in direct sunlight, as this could cause the koi to overheat.",
        "Place a towel over the bag if there isn't a shady spot.",
        "Care for the koi.",
        "Feed the koi specialty pellets regularly and treat any health problems that arise.",
        "Maintain the water quality in the pond and keep it clean, so that the koi stay happy and healthy!"
