The big, metal canister is used to hold all of the ingredients inside the machine, but it has to be frozen in advance to keep them at the right temperature. Although the wait is a little long, using a warm canister will turn your slushie into a soup like melted ice cream. The canister is included with the machine. Avoid trying to use a separate canister, since it likely won\u2019t fit and could damage the machine. Give the canister plenty of time to chill before attempting to use it.

        "It recommends mixing 1 part syrup and 5 parts water.",
        "However, consider this a basic guideline that can and sometimes has to be adjusted.",
        "Mix the syrup in a large cup or tall glass, then add more syrup or water if you wish to alter the flavor.",
        "You could also try making your own flavoring, such as by mixing 1 cup (201 g) of sugar in 4 cups (950 mL) of water.",
        "Add food coloring and a flavor extract afterward.",
        "To buy more syrup, shop online.",
        "You can get it from the manufacturer or other retailers.",
        "Fill the metal canister halfway with fresh ice cubes.",
        "The machine has a pair of inlet caps, a big one for ice and salt and a small one for syrup.",
        "Remove the bigger one and set it aside.",
        "Then, drop ice cubes in one by one to fill the canister.",
        "The amount you will need depends on the size of the ice, so have plenty of ice cubes ready.",
        "Drop the ice cubes in while the machine is running.",
        "It\u2019s perfectly safe and necessary for getting the Slush Puppie mix to the right consistency.",
        "Use the salt inlet cap to measure out 2 capfuls of salt.",
        "The manufacturer measures the amount of salt used according to the round inlet cap you removed when putting ice into the machine.",
        "Flip the cap so the open end is face up, then fill it to the brim with table salt.",
        "Pour each capful through the inlet hole and into the canister.",
        "Although you may feel like you're using way too much salt, it doesn\u2019t end up in the finished Slush Puppie.",
        "It is used to prevent the mix from freezing.",
        "It gets separated out later.",
        "If you don\u2019t wish to use the cap as a measuring tool, you could try doing it on your own.",
        "Start with about 34.12 g, or 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml), of salt, then make adjustments as needed to bring the slush to the right consistency.",
        "Pour 40 mL (1.4  fl oz) of cold water into the machine.",
        "Fill a measuring cup with the correct amount of water, then add it to the mixture through the opening on the lid.",
        "Pour it in gradually to avoid spills.",
        "Afterward, let the machine stir everything together while you prepare the rest of the ingredients.",
        "Keep an eye on the consistency of the Slush Puppie mix.",
        "It won\u2019t be done yet, but it will start forming into a semi-solid as the machine chips the ice.",
        "Add more ice to fill the rest of the canister.",
        "This time, add enough ice to fill the canister up all the way to the top.",
        "If you look at the plastic part around the container, you will be able to see a line marked \u201c3.\u201d The line is right above the lip of the canister.",
        "Make sure the ice doesn\u2019t go above this line.",
        "You might feel like adding the ice all in one go instead of pouring salt in first.",
        "However, avoid doing this.",
        "It could affect the machine or throw off the consistency of the Slush Puppie.",
        "Pour another 3 caps of salt into the machine.",
        "Top the ice with more table salt to prevent the slush from freezing.",
        "Use the inlet cap to measure out the salt, then pour it through the opening.",
        "While you\u2019re getting the remaining ingredients, keep an eye on the mixture to ensure it doesn\u2019t freeze.",
        "If you\u2019re measuring salt on your own, add about 51.18 g, or 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml).",
        "Use more if the slush starts to solidify or you notice the mixer having trouble moving through it.",
        "Measure another 40 mL (1.4  fl oz) of cold water for the mix.",
        "Add cold water to a mixing cup, then pour it into the machine.",
        "This is the last amount of water, ice, or salt you need to add, so check the slush\u2019s consistency.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s somewhat liquid but not too runny.",
        "Refit the inlet cap on the lid when you\u2019re done.",
        "Add more water, ice, or salt now to in order to bring the mix to the proper consistency.",
        "You can also add a little bit later if it is needed to incorporate the syrup.",
        "Pour syrup through the syrup inlet valve on the lid.",
        "This valve is smaller than the ice inlet and is located on the right side of the lid.",
        "It\u2019s a small opening in the lid.",
        "Use it to add all of the syrup you made earlier.",
        "Pour the syrup in gradually so the mixer is better able to incorporate it into the water.",
        "The valve is identifiable because \u201cBeverages high in sugar content only\u201d is printed on the lid.",
        "The valve is right next to the words.",
        "If your Slush Puppie is too runny, add more ice to help it freeze.",
        "Add more syrup to the mixture to prevent it from becoming too solid.",
        "Finishing and Pouring Slush Puppies Let the machine run for 15 to 20 minutes.",
        "During this time, the machine will swirl the slush and syrup together.",
        "Stay near it and check it about every 2 to 3 minutes to see if it\u2019s still working as intended.",
        "Make sure that the mixer is still turning and that the canister is filled with ice and salt.",
        "The machine isn\u2019t meant to operate for more than 40 minutes at a time.",
        "In addition to liquefying your frozen treat, the mixer could sustain permanent damage.",
        "Reverse the mixture\u2019s direction with the power switch if the machine jams.",
        "You may have noticed that the power switch has different settings.",
        "Flipping it to the right, to the \u201cdispense\u201d setting, stops the mixer from moving.",
        "Wait a few seconds, then flip the switch back to \u201cmix.\u201d If it still doesn\u2019t work, repeat flipping between the dispense and mix settings until it does.",
        "You could also shut off the machine for a couple of seconds and wait for the ice around the mixing blades to melt.",
        "Reactivate the mixer afterward and let it run again if it is able to spin freely.",
        "Refill the canister with more ingredients as the water level drops.",
        "This will happen during the 15 or 20 minutes of waiting time.",
        "Start with ice, adding 1 or 2 cubes at a time to fill the canister back up to the brim.",
        "When you\u2019re done, add another 2 or 3 capfuls of salt, followed by another 40 mL (1.4  fl oz) of cold water in afterward.",
        "Add more ingredients until the 15 waiting period is up.",
        "To avoid any problems with the machine, keep the ice level about 3 cm (1.2 in) below the top of the metal canister.",
        "You can wait until the end to add the salt and water.",
        "Unless you need more to change the slush\u2019s consistency, you only have to add salt and water once.",
        "Watch for peaks to form once the mixture reaches the correct consistency.",
        "If you love Slush Puppies, you may have an idea of what the mixture is supposed to look like.",
        "One of the best ways to monitor the consistency is by looking at the shape it takes inside the plastic mixing container.",
        "The slush will splash up in waves toward the lid.",
        "Look for the slush to rise up in several spots around the fill line.",
        "Check the slush\u2019s actual consistency as well.",
        "It\u2019s supposed to consist of a lot of small ice chips.",
        "The ice chips will all have the same color because of the syrup you added.",
        "Turn the dispenser handle clockwise to pour a Slush Puppie.",
        "Flip the power button to \u201cdispense\u201d first.",
        "Then, place a cup underneath the spout on the front of the machine.",
        "Turn the handle to let out a flow of your delicious, frozen treat.",
        "You can leave the machine running until you finish the last of the slush.",
        "Afterward, be sure to clean out the mixing components thoroughly with soap and water."
