A conditioner is usually necessary only if you blow dry your hair often and need extra protection from heat damage. Towel dry your hair. It will be much easier to blow dry your bangs if they are already somewhat dry. You don't want water to be dripping off of your hair--try using your fingers and towel to get it about 75% dry."

Too much product in your bangs--whether it's a volumizing serum or styling spray--can weigh your bangs down and make your hair look greasy.
