                    "description": "Before you obtain your little pet skunk, go to a local pet shop and pick out a large dog crate for it. Pick the biggest one that will fit in your home, so that your skunk will have room to move around in it. Get a crate that is made for extra large dog breeds. These crates are usually about 4 feet (1.2 m) deep, 3 feet (0.91 m) wide, and 4 feet (1.2 m) tall. The cage should be big enough to hold a bed, toys, and a litter box. Skunks naturally live in dens, so the crate will serve as its den.Tip: While you don\u2019t want to keep your skunk caged up while you are home, a crate will keep it safe and secure when you are out of the house."

Don't spend a ton of money on your skunk\u2019s bed. It\u2019s likely that the animal will destroy it with their claws, so you will need to replace the bed on a regular basis."

Get several low-sided pans, like those made for ferrets, and put one in the corner of your skunk\u2019s cage and the others in the rooms where your skunk spends its time. Introduce your skunk to a litter box and they will remember where it is when they need to go to the bathroom. Litter training a skunk can take a bit longer than it does with a cat. However, keep trying and your skunk is likely to get the hang of it. Put the litter boxes in the corner of rooms and the cage. Skunks tend to go to the bathroom in the corner of rooms.Tip: If your skunk is going to the bathroom in an area without a litter box repeatedly, clean the area and then place a litter box there."

If you plan on letting your skunk stay out there when you are not around, you will need a secure cage. If you just want an area where your skunk can explore while you supervise, a pen will work well. Ideally, an outdoor pet would be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) long, 6 feet (1.8 m) wide, and 3 feet (0.91 m) tall. There are commercial outdoor skunk cages and pens available from online retailers. If you want to use a cage to keep your skunk outside, it needs to have a welded metal bottom and top on it. Skunks are good at chewing through wood and can sneak out through small spaces, so the cage needs to be very secure."
