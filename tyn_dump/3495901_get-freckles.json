                    "description": "Freckles are a hereditary trait caused by an uneven distribution of skin pigmentation. A freckle occurs when there is a large concentration of the melanin pigment underneath one spot on your skin. Most natural freckles are small and essentially harmless. They tend to show up on areas exposed to sunlight, like your face, and these are probably the type you're longing for. They also range in color and may be tan, brown, black, yellow, or red. Sometimes freckles form as the result of sunburn. These are larger and often have irregular borders. While regular freckles usually fade after sunlight exposure decreases, sunburn freckles stay put."

The people most likely to develop freckles are those with red hair and pale skin, but freckles are not exclusive to this set of characteristics. People with dark hair are less likely to have freckles, though it is still possible for them to have them. People with light hair and light colored eyes are also more likely to have freckles. To determine if freckles are in your family line, look at your family. Siblings, parents, grandparents, and others who you are directly descended from are your best sources to consider, but extended family whom you are not directly descended from still share some genetic traits with you."

                    "description": "Freckles are drawn out with exposure to UV light. If you have natural freckles, spending a little time in bright sunlight might bring them out of hiding. Be careful, though - you should never stay out long enough to get a burn. Wearing sunscreen that's 20 to 30 SPF will still allow your skin to tan while protecting you from getting burned. When UV rays hit the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin), it thickens slightly, causing the cells in your body to produce more pigment. As a result, the pigmentation of your freckles darkens, making them visible. If you would rather skip the sunbathing, consider exposing yourself to UV rays at a tanning salon. Follow the salon's recommendations concerning the amount of time to spend tanning, since tanning too much in a salon can lead to cancer."

        "Apply a light sweep of foundation, if desired.",
        "For dramatic freckles, do not use foundation.",
        "If the pencil you used was too dark, however, or you want to make your freckles look more subtle, lightly brush a powder foundation on top.",
        "Do not use a liquid foundation since it will cause your faux freckles to smear and rub away.",
        "Getting Cosmetic Freckle Tattooing Understand how cosmetic tattooing works.",
        "Cosmetic tattooing is done with an electric needle that rapidly deposits ink pigments into the dermis layer of skin.",
        "Cosmetic tattooing is also known as permanent makeup.",
        "These procedures are often used to create the appearance of fuller eyebrows, permanent eyeliner, or permanent lipstick, but using it to create freckles has become more popular in recent years.",
        "A hollow, vibrating needle will pierce through the top layer of skin and release a droplet of pigment.",
        "While cosmetic tattooing is possible to remove, it is very difficult to do so, and your skin may never look the same again.",
        "Consult a few professionals equipped for cosmetic tattooing.",
        "To reduce the risk of negative side effects, like infection, make sure that the professional you hire knows what he or she is really doing.",
        "Check each tattoo artist's credentials.",
        "Make sure that he or she is a properly trained and licensed aesthetician.",
        "Get a recommendation from a plastic surgeon or former client.",
        "Speak with former clients, and ask to see before-and-after photos of freckle tattoos.",
        "Discuss the look you want.",
        "The professional may have suggestions, but in order to get the look you really want, you need to have an active voice in the matter.",
        "If possible, go over a few photographs to determine which freckled look is right for you.",
        "The tattoo artist will help you determine the best hue and shade of color for your freckles.",
        "You should also discuss the placement of your freckles.",
        "Get the tattoo.",
        "When the time comes, schedule an appointment and get your freckles tattooed on.",
        "Before the procedure, the technician will sketch out the area that will be tattooed using a sterile surgical pen.",
        "Anesthetic gel will then be placed on the area to numb it.",
        "During the procedure, you can expect to feel a little stinging sensation.",
        "Make sure that the aesthetician uses sterile gloves and sterilized equipment during the procedure.",
        "Take care of your tattoo afterward.",
        "You will need to reduce the swelling with a cold compress and apply an antibiotic ointment to minimize the risk of infection.",
        "Follow the tattoo artist's instructions about how to take proper care of the area while it heals.",
        "Note that immediately after the freckle tattoo is applied, the color will look dark.",
        "This should not be a cause for concern, though.",
        "The color will fade to its final shade after about three weeks.",
        "If the area seems unusually swollen, painful, or red after the first few days, however, there is some chance that an infection or allergic reaction may have been triggered."
