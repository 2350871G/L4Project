        "Turn the cut of meat on your cutting board so that the fibers run left to right in front of you.",
        "Your blade will cut perpendicular to the grain of the meat.Tip: There is no right or wrong way to make jerky.",
        "Whether you cut with, or against the grain of the meat is entirely a matter of personal preference.",
        "If you like snacking on softer jerky or hate pulling on tough chunks of meat while eating it, this is the ideal way to cut the jerky.",
        "If you want something in the middle, you can cut diagonally.",
        "This is generally an unpopular way to cut meat for jerky though, since most people prefer one method over the other.",
        "Most cuts of meat are also pre-trimmed so that the grain rests vertically or horizontally, so cutting diagonally will result in a lot of differently-sized strips.",
        "Making Your Cuts Slice through larger chunks of meat to make them 1\u20132 in (2.5\u20135.1 cm) thick.",
        "If you have a large, asymmetrical chunk of meat or you\u2019re using a thicker cut, thin the meat down into smaller portions.",
        "Steady the top of the meat carefully and cut horizontally through the meat.",
        "Trim larger cuts of meat down so that they\u2019re 1\u20132 inches (2.5\u20135.1 cm) thick depending on your personal preference.The thickness of the meat is completely up to you, but you do need the thickness to be uniform for each strip.",
        "This will ensure that all of the strips dry evenly when you make the jerky.",
        "Whether you cut with or against the grain for this does not matter.",
        "It isn\u2019t the actual cutting that influences the texture of the meat, but the direction and shape of the grain contained on each strip.",
        "Orient your meat on the cutting board based on the grain.",
        "Turn the meat so that the grain is either parallel or perpendicular to the knife.",
        "If you\u2019re cutting against the grain, the grooves in the fibers of the meat should be running to the left and right.",
        "If you\u2019re cutting with the grain, turn the meat so that the grain is resting vertically in front of you.",
        "Make straight cuts through the meat to trim it into thin slices.",
        "Hold the meat steady with your nondominant fingertips.",
        "Start on any edge of the cut.",
        "Hold the blade of the knife over the meat so that you\u2019re trimming a thin, vertical strip.",
        "Lower the knife and slide the blade back and forth to cut the strip.",
        "Keep the thickness of the strip between \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm).Tip: The meat will shrink  a little when you dehydrate or smoke it.",
        "Keep this in mind when choosing the thickness of your strips.",
        "Thicker cuts will take slightly longer to cook than thinner cuts.",
        "The difference won\u2019t be radical though, unless your strips are larger than \u20444 in (1.9 cm).",
        "The strips that you cut at the edge of the meat will naturally be a little less beautiful than the rest of the strips since the sides of a cut are rarely perfectly straight.",
        "Continue cutting parallel strips out of the meat to cut the jerky to size.",
        "Hold your blade parallel to your first cut.",
        "Move the blade back and forth while driving the knife into your cutting board until the second \u20444\u2013\u20442 in (0.64\u20131.27 cm) strip is complete.",
        "Continue cutting the meat this way to keep each piece parallel.",
        "Once you\u2019ve cut the entire piece of meat into thin, evenly-sized strips, you\u2019re ready to begin marinating and drying the meat!"
