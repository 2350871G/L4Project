        "Slip the folded part behind the ribbon so that it is sticking out of the bottom edge by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "For a fluffier tutu, you can stack 2 to 3 strips of tulle.",
        "Pull the long ends of the tulle strip through the loop.",
        "Gather both of the long tails of the tulle strip.",
        "Thread them through the loop, then tug down on them to tighten the knot.",
        "Make sure that the knot is tight enough so that it scrunches together and folds the ribbon.",
        "When you are done, the tulle should be sticking out from the bottom edge of the ribbon.",
        "Slide the tulle over to the left knot, and add another strip.",
        "Once you have the first strip of tulle secure, slide it along the ribbon until it bumps up against the knot on the left side.",
        "Fold a second strip of tulle in half, slip it behind the ribbon, and pull the ends through the loop.",
        "Slide it over until it bumps up against the first piece of tulle.",
        "Continue adding strips of tulle until the you reach the other knot.",
        "You can control the fullness of your tutu by how tightly you push the strips of tulle together.",
        "The more you scrunch them together, the fuller the tutu will be.",
        "The more loosely you scrunch them, the thinner it will be.",
        "Take the tutu off of the cylinder base and trim it, if needed.",
        "Once you reach the knot on the other end of your ribbon, you are done.",
        "Take the tutu off of the cylinder and spread it out on a flat surface.",
        "Smooth out the tulle strips, then trim down any pieces that are too long.",
        "You can also leave the bottom of the tutu untrimmed for an uneven look.",
        "This would be perfect for a forest or pirate fairy!",
        "Don't worry about pieces that are too short.",
        "They won't be visible thanks to the fullness of the tutu.",
        "Wrap it around your waist and tie the ends into a big bow.",
        "You can position the bow on the front or on the back.",
        "If the bow is too big, trim down the ends to make it shorter.",
        "Make sure that you cut off the same amount on both ends, and that you heat seal them.",
        "Using an Elastic Waistband Get some tulle on a spool and cut it twice the length you need it to be.",
        "Decide how long you want the tutu to be\u2014anywhere from mid-thigh to knee-length would work great.",
        "Double that measurement, then cut the tulle accordingly.",
        "Gather the pieces into a pile so they don't get tangled.",
        "Tulle on a spool is about 6 inches (15 cm) wide, which is perfect for tutus.",
        "You can find it in arts and crafts stores.",
        "You will need to use the entire spool.",
        "A longer/fuller tutu may need up to three spools of tulle.",
        "Tie a piece of elastic around your waist, then take it off.",
        "Choose a sturdy elastic that is between \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick.",
        "Wrap it around your waist, tie it in a knot, then slip it off.",
        "The elastic needs to be tight enough so that it doesn't slip off of your waist, but loose enough so that it feels comfortable.",
        "If you are making a tutu for a child, a thin, elastic headband may work as long as it is not too tight.",
        "For a neater finish, overlap the ends by \u20442 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm), then sew them by hand or by machine.",
        "Put the elastic onto a cylindrical base.",
        "Roll a piece of poster paper into a tube that matches your waist measurement.",
        "Secure it with tape, then slide the elastic over the tube.",
        "This is not absolutely necessary, but it will make it easier to attach the tulle.",
        "It will also prevent you from accidentally stretching the elastic out while tying the tulle on.",
        "Fold a piece of tulle in half and slide it under the elastic.",
        "Bring the narrow ends of the tulle together to fold it in half.",
        "Slip the folded part under the elastic so that it is sticking out from the bottom edgy by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "For a fuller tutu, stack 2 to 3 strips of tulle.",
        "Thread the long ends of the tulle down through the loop.",
        "Take both ends of the tulle and pull them down through the loop.",
        "Gently tug down on them to tighten the knot.",
        "Make sure that the knot is tight.",
        "Add more strips of tulle until the elastic is full.",
        "Keep adding strips of tulle using the same technique as you did for the first strip.",
        "Scrunch them together so that you can see the elastic.",
        "The more you scrunch them together, the fuller the tutu will be.",
        "Be careful not the stretch the elastic, however, or the tutu will be too loose.",
        "If you tied the elastic, slip the ends of the elastic under the tulle to hide them.",
        "Slip the tutu off of the cylinder base and trim off any unevenness.",
        "You only need to cut down the pieces that look too long compared to the others.",
        "Don't worry about the pieces that are too short.",
        "They will be hidden inside the tutu and unnoticeable.",
        "Alternatively, you can leave the bottom of the tutu untrimmed.",
        "This would be great for a wicked or spooky fairy!",
        "Using a Crochet Headband Base Buy tulle on a spool and cut it twice as long you want the tutu to be.",
        "Decide how long you want the tutu to be, then double that measurement.",
        "Cut the tulle down to that measurement, making sure to use up the entire spool.",
        "Keep all your pieces of tulle in an organized stack.",
        "You may need up to three spools if your tutu is going to be very long and/or full.",
        "Your tutu can be any length you want it to be.",
        "Something between mid-thigh and knee-length would be ideal, however.",
        "You can buy tulle on a spool in an arts and crafts store.",
        "It is about 6 inches (15 cm) wide and perfect for making tutus.",
        "Get a crochet headband that looks nice with your tulle.",
        "These headbands look like a wide band that is crocheted out of thin, colorful elastic.",
        "They are usually a few inches/centimeters wide.",
        "The holes will allow you to make additional rows of knotted tulle for a thicker tutu.",
        "This method will work the best for a child's tutu.",
        "The elastic headband may not fit an older child's or adult's waist.",
        "If you really want to use this method for an adult's tutu, buy some crocheted ribbon from a fabric store, then cut and sew it into a waistband that fits you.",
        "If you only have a skinny elastic headband that is not crocheted, this method will not work for you.",
        "Refer to the elastic method instead.",
        "Place the headband onto a cylindrical object that fits your waist.",
        "Roll some poster paper into a tube that's the same size as your waist.",
        "Tape or staple the tube together, then slip the headband over it.",
        "This will make it easier to attach the tulle.",
        "Fold a strip of tulle in half, then thread it down through a hole on the headband.",
        "Bring the narrow ends of a tulle strip together to fold it in half.",
        "Choose a hole along the bottom edge of your headband to start with, then pull the folded end of the tulle down through the hole.",
        "Make sure that you are pushing the tulle down through the hole and not up.",
        "You want the loop to be sticking out of the bottom of the headband by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).",
        "You can stack 2 to 3 strips of tulle together for an even thicker tutu.",
        "Thread the loose ends of the tulle strip down through the hole.",
        "Grab the two loose ends of the tulle.",
        "Thread them through the looped (folded end) of the tulle.",
        "Gently tug down on them.",
        "The two strands should now be sticking out of the bottom edge of the headband.",
        "Fill the rest of the bottom row with tulle.",
        "Keep attaching strips of tulle following the same procedure described in the previous step.",
        "Once you have the first row filled, you can do another row for an even thicker tutu.",
        "Trim the tutu down, if needed.",
        "Because you folded the strips in half earlier, there should not be any unevenness along the bottom edge of your tutu.",
        "If you see any parts that are longer, trim then down with a pair of scissors.",
        "Don't worry about any pieces that are shorter, however; they will be hidden inside the tutu!",
        "You can also leave the tutu untrimmed for a raggedy look."
