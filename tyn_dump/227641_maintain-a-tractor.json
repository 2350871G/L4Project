To be sure you properly maintain your specific make and model of tractor, you should read through the manual that came with it. Many tractors require specific types of lubricants and hydraulic fluids that you can identify in the manual. Using the wrong kind could damage your tractor. If you do not have a manual for your tractor, you may be able to find the information on the manufacturer's website."

Many newer model tractors even have plastic windows on fluid reservoirs to check things like hydraulic fluid levels. Give your tractor a visual inspection before and after each use. Make note of any issues you identify to make sure you address them before the next time you use the tractor."

                    "description": "Use a tire pressure gauge on each tire and compare it to the tire\u2019s pressure rating written on the sidewall. Tractor tires can last years, but operating a tractor with under-inflated tires can ruin the sidewall and cause the tires to wear faster than they should. Under-inflated tires will also cause the tractor to burn more fuel in normal operations. You may want to adjust tire pressure for different types of jobs. For instance, if you plan on driving your tractor on the road, you might want to add a few more pounds of air. Reducing tire pressure on slick surfaces like mud can help increase traction. Tires lose pressure more quickly when temperatures change from cold to hot, so you may want to check your tire pressure more frequently in the spring and fall."

Check each of the lights after each use of the tractor so you can address any electrical issues as they arise. If a light fails to work, it may be a blown out bulb or fuse that needs to be replaced. If neither of those solve the problem, your tractor may need to be serviced by a technician. Check your owner\u2019s manual to find the correct type of bulb or fuse needed to fix a bad light."
