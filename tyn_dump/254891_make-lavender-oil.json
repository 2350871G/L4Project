                    "description": "Cut off the stems of lavender along with the flowers, in 6 inch (15 centimeter) segments or longer. The leaves and new stems can be used to infuse oil as well as the flowers, although the woody, thick stems near the base should be avoided. You may use flower buds or strong-smelling flowers. You may wish to pick more lavender than you think you need. Then, if the oil you create isn't strong enough to suit your preferences, you will not have to wait for a new batch of lavender to dry."

                    "headline": "Let the lavender dry.",
                    "description": "If you are using fresh lavender, dry it first in shade or wrapped in a cloth, to enhance its aroma and minimize the chance of the oil becoming rancid. Tie the sprig up with rubber bands or a string and let it hang upside down in a dry, warm area. Exposing it to sunlight will dry the lavender out much faster, but could break down some of its aromatic oils. Fresh cut lavender may take two weeks to dry fully. Some infusers dry it for only one to three days, until it is withered but not crunchy; this reduces the chance of spoilage greatly, but does not eliminate it."

If using buds, open them up with a knife or fingers. Place it in a clean jar. Wash your hands and jar first if they are dirty, but dry thoroughly before bringing them into contact with the lavender. Mixing water into the oil may interfere with the infusion."

Almond oil, olive oil, or safflower oil are commonly used for this purpose, although you may wish to smell these first and avoid strong-smelling bottles that could overpower the lavender scent."

Creating Lavender Balm or Salve Follow the instructions for creating an infused oil first. This method turns a lavender-infused oil into a salve that can be rubbed onto your skin to lessen inflammation and pain. First, you'll need to create the lavender-infused oil as described in another section, or purchase some from a herbalist store. Shave beeswax using a knife or cheese grater.
