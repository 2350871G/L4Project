Most paint programs will allow you to change the size of the canvas at any time. While not required, it is recommended to change the background of the canvas to a non-white color that won\u2019t share any colors of your sprite."

This does not need to be anything defined - just a rough image of what you want the final product to be. This allows you to get the size of the sprite down, in addition to deciding on a basic pose for your base. It is recommended to choose a more natural or laid back pose as opposed to a more action-oriented one."

Begin to draw over your sketch with more defined details, using the sketch from the previous step as a guide. This can include arms, legs, clothing, and other various points of interest. Continue until you feel you\u2019ve included everything. If your paint program has the option for multiple layers, it is recommended to do this step on a new layer above the the sketch\u2019s layer."

            "description": "Shading helps give your sprite depth and allows it to stand out in a 2D space. First, determine where your \u201clight source\u201d is coming from. This will give you an idea of where your darker colors will go to illustrate shading. Using the colors selected in the previous step, select darker tones of the colors using your paint program\u2019s color selector. Place them based on where your light source is facing; if it is directly in front of the sprite, for example, place them towards the backside of the sprite. Take note of any parts of the sprite that might cast shadow on other parts: these include limbs, branches, and articles of clothing."
