Forum signatures- If you're a member of any forums, you may want to stick a link or banner in your signature for people to click. It may not generate as much traffic, but it does help get some people involved. Word of mouth- Tell your friends to come join you on the forum. If they're not too interested or don't have much to say, you can ask them to post tech help questions for people, such as yourself, to answer. Ask them to tell their friends and so on.
