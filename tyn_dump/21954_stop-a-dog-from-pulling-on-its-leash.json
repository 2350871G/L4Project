The collar shouldn\u2019t be so tight that it is choking the dog, but should be tight enough so that it does not slide up and down the dog\u2019s neck. You should be able to slide your hand between the dog\u2019s neck and collar when it is secured in place. Many people choose to use a harness instead of a collar. The harness disperses the pressure to the dog's back rather than its neck. This will allow you to train your dog to walk on a leash without having to rely on the choking feeling the dog gets when pulling at its leash."
