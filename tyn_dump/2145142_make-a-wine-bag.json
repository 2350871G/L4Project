    "text": " Making a Paper Bag Choose your paper. You can use just about any type of paper you want for this method, including brown kraft paper and wrapping paper. You can even collage magazine pages or scrapbooking paper into a larger sheet for a more unique bag. If you making a collaged bag, assemble the paper using a glue stick. Reinforce the seams with clear tape. If the paper is very thin, such as wrapping paper, glue another sheet of paper to the back to reinforce it. Cut the paper down to 18 by 14 inches (46 by 36 cm). This will be enough to hold most 12 by 3-inch (30.5 by 7.6-cm) bottles with a little extra wiggle room. Fold the top narrow edge down by 1 inch (2.5 cm) to create a top seam. Turn the paper so that the back is facing you. Fold 1 of the 14-inch (36-cm) edges down by 1 inch (2.5 cm), and crease it with your fingernail. Your paper should now be 17 inches (43 cm) tall. Fold the long edges to the middle to create a gatefold and tape them. Keep the paper with the back side facing you. Fold the left and right long edges to the middle and secure them with a strip of tape. Run your fingernail along the edges to create sharp, neat creases. The 1-inch (2.5-cm) seam you folded earlier should now be inside the bag. Fold the bottom edge of the bag up by 3 \u20442 inches (8.9 cm). Make sure that you are folding the clean bottom edge, and not the edge that you folded by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Run your fingernail along the fold to sharpen the crease. Open the bottom of the bag to create a diamond shape. When you folded the bottom edge up, you created a pocket. Open this pocket up so that you can see the inside of the bag. Flatten the pocket to create a diamond shape with a vertical seam running down the middle. Take a moment to sharpen the angled folds on each side of the rectangle. Tape down the top and bottom corners of the diamond. Fold the top and bottom points of the diamond down to the middle. Overlap them enough to make the diamond 3 \u20442 inches (8.9 cm) tall. Place a piece of clear tape across the middle of the diamond to hold the points down. For a stronger hold, use glue instead. Fold the diamond in half and fold down the sides of the bag. You will have a horizontal crease running across the bottom of the bag. Fold the diamond in half along this crease. The bottom of your bag will now look a trapezoid. Fold the left and right edges of the bag down until the bag is 3 \u20442 inches (8.9 cm) wide. The trapezoid at the bottom should now be a rectangle. Open the bag and push out the edges from the inside. Unfold the left and right sides. Open the bag and stick your hand into it. Stand the bag up on a flat surface, and push the bottom out until it flattens. Use your fingers to help push the corners out as needed. Reinforce the top and base of the bag with thin cardboard. Cut a  3 1\u20442-inch (8.9-cm) square out of cardstock or thin cardboard, and place it into the bag. Cut a set of  3 1\u20442 by 1-inch (8.9 by 2.5-cm) rectangles. Open up the seams inside the bag, and tuck them inside. Secure them with double-side tape or glue. This will help make the handles stronger. You only need the skinny rectangles inside the front and back seams. The front and back panel of the bag are smooth. If you see creases, that's a side panel. Punch 2 holes into each side of the bag and add the handles. Use a hole puncher to make 2 holes in the top edge of the bag. Cut a piece of cord, and thread each end through each hole. Tie the ends of the cord into knots inside the bag. Repeat this step for the other side of the bag with another cord. Insert grommets or eyelets into the holes before you add the ribbon for a nicer touch. If the knots are too small and slip out of the holes, tie the ends of the cord together. Use ribbon for a fancier touch. Insert the bottle into the bag. Be careful when carrying the bag. It is better to hold it by the bottom, especially if you only used tape on the bottom of the bag. Sewing a Fabric Bag Cut 4 18 by 7-inch (46 by 18-cm) rectangles out of fabric. You'll be using 2 rectangles for the outside of the bag, and 2 rectangles for the lining. You can use the same fabric for all 4 pieces, or you can use different fabric for the outside and lining. Consider using a solid color for 1 set, and a pattern for the second set. Add any desired embroidery to the piece that you want for the outside of the bag now. Make 1-inch (2.5-cm) vertical marks on each of the long edges. These marks will eventually create the spaces for your drawstring channels. They need to be 12 inches (30 cm) from the bottom of the rectangle. Measure up 12 inches (30 cm) from the narrow end of each rectangle, then make a 1-inch (2.5-cm) long mark. Do this for each of the long edges on your rectangles. Make sure that you draw on the wrong side of the fabric. Skip this step if you do not want to add a drawstring. Pin the rectangles together across the bottom and sides. Take the 2 pieces that you want to be on the outside of your bag, and pin them together, with the right sides facing in. You only need to pin across 1 of the narrow ends and both of the long edges. Repeat this step for the 2 pieces that you want on the inside of the bag. Make sure that the right sides are facing in too. Sew the rectangles using a 1/4-inch (0.64-cm) seam allowance. Use a straight stitch and a thread color that matches the fabric. Sew across the edges that you pinned, but do not sew across the 1-inch (2.5-cm) marks that you made earlier. Remove the pins when you are done sewing. If the rectangles are different colors, you will need to change the thread and bobbin accordingly. Backstitch when you start and finish sewing to prevent unraveling. This includes before and after the gaps. If you won't be adding drawstrings, sew across the entire length of the bag. Do not leave any 1-inch (2.5-cm) gaps. Flatten the corners, then sew across them to create 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) flaps. Take 1 of the rectangles, and flatten the corners so that the side and bottom seams are touching. Sew across each corner, 1 \u20442 inches (3.8 cm) from the point to create 2 triangular flaps or wings. Repeat this step for the other rectangle. Change the thread color if you need to. Use a straight stitch and remember to backstitch when you start and finish sewing. Cut each of the 1 1/2-inch (3.8-cm) flaps off to reduce bulk. How much you cut the flaps off is up to you, but anywhere between \u20448 and \u20444 inch (0.32 and 0.64 cm) would be ideal. If you notice that the fabric is starting to fray, sew across the raw edges using a zigzag stitch. Fold the top edges down by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm) to create a neat hem. Take the first bag, and fold the raw edge down by \u20442 inch (1.3 cm). Work your way around the bag so that you can still open it. Press the hem with an iron, then repeat the process for the other bag. You are folding the hems down towards the wring side of the fabric. Do not sew the hems down yet. Turn 1 bag right-side-out, then tuck the other bag into it. Choose a bag to be on the outside and turn it right-side-out. Take the other bag, keep it turned inside-out, and tuck it into the first bag. Sew around the top edge using a 1/4-inch (0.64-cm) seam allowance. Make sure that the side seams and hems match up first. Sew around the top, folded edge of your bag using a straight stitch and a 1.4-inch (0.64-cm) seam allowance. Change your thread and bobbin color accordingly so that they match the fabric. Start sewing at 1 of the side seams, and remember to backstitch. Use pins to hold the fabric in place if needed, then pull them out when you are done. You can add a rickrack trim if you want to. Sew 2 rows around the bag to make the drawstring channels. Slide the bag onto the arm of your sewing machine. Find the 1-inch (2.5-cm) gaps in the sides of your bag. Sew around the bag from the top edge of the first gap to the top edge of the second gap, then back around to the first gap. Repeat this step for the bottom edges of the gaps. Use a straight stitch for this step. Match the thread color to the bag, or use a contrasting color for a decorative look. If the bag won't fit onto the arm of the sewing machine, open up the bag so that you can see the inside, then slide it under the sewing machine's foot. Skip this step if you are not making a drawstring bag. Thread a 24-inch (61-cm) piece of ribbon through the left gap. Secure a safety pin to a 24-inch (61-cm) piece of ribbon. Insert the safety pin through the left gap. Guide the safety pin through the channel, past the right gap, and back out the left gap. Remove the safety pin and tie the ends of the ribbon together. The width of the ribbon is up to you, but it needs to be narrower than 1 inch (2.5 cm). You can even use thin rope instead. Singe the ends of the ribbon with a flame to keep it from fraying. There should not be anything sticking out of the right gap. Pretend that it does not exist for this step. Skip this step if you are not making a drawstring bag. Thread another 24-inch (61-cm) piece of ribbon through the right gap. Cut another 24-inch (61-cm) piece of ribbon just like the first piece. Secure a safety pin to the end of the ribbon and push it through the right gap. Pull the ribbon through the channel, past the left gap, and out the right gap again. Remove the safety pin and tie the ends of the ribbon together. You should have 2 loops sticking out of the sides of your bag, 1 on the left side, and 1 on the right. Skip this step if you are not making a drawstring bag. Insert a wine bottle into the bag. Close the bag by pulling on the ribbon loops. If you did not make a drawstring bag, wrap a ribbon around the bag where the bottle's neck is, then tie it into a bow. Give your bag a nicer touch by stenciling designs onto it. Do this before you add the wine bottle, however. Making a No-Sew Bag Cut a 24 by 7-inch (61 by 18-cm) rectangle out of felt fabric. This will eventually give you a bag that is 12 inches (30 cm) tall and 7 inches (18 cm) wide. If you want a taller bag, make the rectangle longer. For example, a 36 by 7-inch (91 by 18-cm) rectangle will give you an 18-inch (46-cm) tall bag. For a nicer finish, cut the rectangle out using pinking shears instead. Fold the bag in half with the right sides facing out. You will not be turning this bag inside-out like you would with a regular sewn bag. At this point, you can leave the top edge as-is, or your can cut it into a curve for a fancier bag. Hot glue the sides of the bag, starting 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom. Working 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) at a time, hot glue the bag together. Start 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the folded bottom of the bag, and finish at the top edge. Make the glued area no wider than\u20444 inch (0.64 cm), or the bag will be too narrow. If you don't have hot glue, use fabric glue instead. You will have to wait 10 to 15 minutes for the glue to dry, however. Don't glue the bag all the way to the bottom. This will allow the bottom of the bag to flatten out when you insert the bottle. Cut a slit into the back of the bag to hold the ribbon, if desired. Choose your ribbon first, then measure its width. Flip the bag over to the bag, and draw 2 vertical lines in the back, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. The length of these lines should match the ribbon's width. Cut these lines with scissors, making sure that you only cut through the back layer of fabric. How far down you make these lines depends on the height of the bag and the height of the bottle. The lines should rest right at the base of the bottle's neck. Decorate the bag as desired. It is much easier to do this while the bag is sitting flat. You can leave the bag blank, or you can embellish it to make it more special. Here are some ideas:\nUse a stencil and paint to create a fancy design on the front. Decorate the bag with metallic puffy paint. Embellish the bag with tiny rhinestones. This will look great alongside other designs. Iron an applique to the front of the bag. Embroider the edges of the bag with embroidery floss and a straight stitch or blanket stitch. Insert a bottle into the bag and wrap a ribbon around the neck. If you cut vertical slits for the ribbon, thread the ribbon through the slits first, then wrap both ends to the front of the bag, and tie them into a bow. Cut the ends of the ribbon at angles, then singe them with a flame for a nicer touch.",
