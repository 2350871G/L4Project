The plywood or plastic will serve as a barrier, safeguarding delicate exterior features from falling shingles, nails, and miscellaneous debris.

Step into the harness and pull it up over your shoulders, then tighten down the cinch points at the hips and chest. Finally, attach the carabiner end of the safety rope to the ring on the roof anchor, feed the opposite end through the nylon lanyard, and clip the lanyard onto the back of the harness. If you happen to slip while wearing the harness, the safety rope will catch on the teeth inside the lanyard clip, stopping your descent.
