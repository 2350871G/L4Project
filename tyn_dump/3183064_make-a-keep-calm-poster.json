You want it to have a cream-like consistency. Paint the crown. Dip your foam brush into the paint and tap off any excess paint onto a paper towel. Carefully tap the paint over the stencil. Avoid using too much paint, or the paint will seep under the stencil. Remove the crown stencil. Carefully pull off the tape, and then lift the stencil off. Be careful not to smudge the paint. You want to remove the stencil while the paint is still wet to avoid chipping it. Position and paint the letter stencils. Most letter stencils will come on a large sheet of paper, and there is usually one of each letter. You will have to do each letter one at a time. Position the letter where you want it to go, and paint over it. Lift the stencil, and move on to another part of the poster; make sure that the stencil sheet doesn't touch the painted letter. This will help prevent the paint from smudging. If you cannot find any letter stencils you like, you will need to make your own. Use a word processing program to create the text, and print it out onto a sheet of cardstock. Use a craft knife to cut the letters out. If you are having troubles cutting in a straight line, use a metal ruler to help guide you. Wait for the paint to dry. Most acrylic paints dry to the touch quickly, about 20 to 30 minutes. Each brand will be a little different, however, so you might want to check the drying times on the paint bottle you have. Use an eraser to erase any visible pencil marks. Make sure that the paint is absolutely dry before you do this, or you will risk smudging the paint. Painting a Poster by Hand Gather your supplies. If you have a steady hand, you can outline the crown and letters, and then fill them in using paint. Here's a list of what you will need:\nRectangular sheet of paper\nPencil\nEraser\nRuler\nAcrylic paint\nPaintbrush\nPaper plate or palette Find a rectangular piece of paper. You can use poster or construction paper. If you want a poster that has a pattern on it, then use scrapbooking paper. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. If you choose to use scrapbooking paper, you will have to cut it down to make it a rectangle. Draw your guidelines. Use a long ruler and a pencil to lightly sketch lines across the poster where you want the crown and letters to go. This will help you keep everything even and straight. Use a pencil to sketch out the crown near the top of the poster. Try to make it as centered as possible. The crown should be about one third of the width of the paper. Try not to press too hard with the pencil, and don't worry about making it too clean. You will be erasing the pencil later. Use a pencil to sketch out the letters. If necessary, use a ruler to help you make the lines straight. Try not to make the lines too dark, or you won't be able to erase them fully. Pour the paint out onto a palette. If the paint is very thick, you might get some visible brush strokes. Consider adding a few drops of water to it and mixing it. It should have the consistency of cream. Start painting in the letters and crown. If you are left-handed, start painting from the right side of the poster. If you are right-handed, start painting from the left. A flat-tipped brush will be the best for the letters, as it will give you the crispest lines. A pointy, round-tipped brush will be the best for getting into corners and creating details. Try to use a synthetic/taklon or sable hair brush. Camel hair will be too soft, and a boar bristle brush will be too stiff. Try to paint in many, but thin layers. This will help reduce brush strokes. If you apply the paint too thickly, you'll be more likely to get brush strokes. Wait for the paint to dry. It will take about 20 to 30 minutes for most types of acrylic paint, but you might want to check the label on the bottle just to be sure. Erase the pencil marks. Make sure that the paint is completely dry first, then gently erase any visible pencil marks. Using Paper Cut-Outs to Make the Poster Gather your supplies. If you like to cut and use glue, this version might be fun for you to make. You can also use letter stickers to make the words instead, but keep in mind that the stickers will be glossier than the rest of your poster. Here's a list of what you will need:\nRectangular sheet of paper\nColored paper (letters and crown)\nPencil\nEraser\nRuler\nCraft knife\nLetter stickers (optional)\nGlue stick\nEraser (optional) Grab a rectangular piece of paper. You can use poster paper or construction paper. If you want a poster with a pattern on it, use scrapbooking paper. You can find it in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. If you decide to use scrapbooking paper, cut it down to make it a rectangle. Sketch out your guidelines. Use a long ruler and a pencil to lightly draw some lines where you want everything to go. This will help you align the letters and crown. Sketch out the crown and letters onto a sheet of paper. You can also print out the outline of a crown and some letters onto a sheet of paper. Make sure that the crown and letters are not filled in by any designs. If you want, you can also use letter-shaped stickers to make the words. Keep in mind, however, that most stickers tend to be glossy. If you use stickers, then the words will have a different finish than the rest of your poster. Use a craft knife to carefully cut the letters and crown out. Be sure to cut just inside the outline. Also, try hard not to nick the crown or letters, as they will be going right onto your poster. If you find that the knife is not cutting smoothly, the dull is probably dull. Try changing the blade for a new one. Glue the crown and letters onto the poster. Flip the crown over, and place it down onto a piece of scrap paper. Use a glue stick to apply a thin layer of glue over the back of the crown, then paste the crown down onto the poster. Use your fist to smooth it down. Glue the letters down onto the poster.Flip each letter over, and apply some glue onto the back. Stick the letter onto the poster before moving onto the next one. You will notice the piece of scrap paper getting more and more glue marks over time. Try to avoid these marks, or your letters will become dirty. Wait for the glue to dry before erasing the pencil marks. Try to go in the same direction while erasing\u2014so always rub your eraser in an upwards direction, or a downwards direction. Don't rub back and forth, or you will risk dislodging the paper.",
