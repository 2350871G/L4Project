If you find a design online that you like, you can print it off to copy later, or start drawing your own unique idea either by hand or on the computer.Symmetry can also be a big component of rangoli. North India values large, flowing designs, whereas the Tamil version focuses on intricacy and symmetry. Whichever way you choose to go, make sure to pick a pattern that you love! One of the lovely things about rangoli is that it can be any size you\u2019d like, and it can follow simple or complex patterns."
