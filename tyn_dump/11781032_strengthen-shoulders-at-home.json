While stretching, inhale for 3 seconds, hold it for 3 seconds, and exhale slowly to focus your breathing. This will also help you stay in the flow of things while stretching.Warning: If you are working on stretching your shoulders after an injury or because your muscles have been weakened, stretching is especially important. Do not skip your stretching unless you\u2019ve been advised to do so by your doctor. Never overexert yourself past your natural range of motion. Do each of these stretching exercises twice if you really want to ensure you stay limber. If you\u2019re incorporating your shoulder exercises into another workout routine, work your shoulder stretches into your other stretches. Stretching alone can actually strengthen your muscles! Do this daily if you\u2019re trying to prepare for a new workout routine or want to stay flexible and limber."
