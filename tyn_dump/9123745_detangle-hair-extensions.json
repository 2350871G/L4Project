Wash the extensions with water and your usual shampoo, rinsing well to ensure that there are no suds left behind. For extensions made of natural hair, use an alcohol-free, sulfate-free shampoo formulated for color-treated hair. For synthetic hair extensions, use a mild shampoo or one formulated for synthetic hair.
