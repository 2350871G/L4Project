                    "description": "In order to collect the drippings to make the gravy, you need to cook the pork first. This can be done in one of two ways. Roast the pork: Select your cut of pork and place it in a oven-proof dish or pan fat-side down. Preheat the oven to 400\u00b0F (204\u00b0C). When the oven has heated, place the roasting dish and pork into the oven. Roast the pork for 30 minutes and then flip it so the pork is fat-side up. Rotating the pork allows the whole pork cut to roast thoroughly. Remove the pork and let it stand for 10 minutes. Sautee pork chops: Season your pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat butter in a large skillet or pan on medium-high heat. If you prefer, you can use olive oil instead of butter. Place the pork chops in the skillet and cook them until they are brown on both sides and cooked all the way through. This should take three to five minutes. The pork is done when the meat is white on the inside."
