    "text": " Simple Cucumber Juice Peel your cucumbers if they are waxed. The skin of a cucumber is coated in a protective wax. While you can eat this coating without much problem, the wax will distort the texture of cucumber juice. You can accomplish this task by using either a potato peeler or a sharp knife with a smooth blade. Slice off the ends of your cucumbers using a sharp knife. The bottom and top stem are hard, inedible parts that you should not attempt to turn into juice. Chop the cucumbers into large chunks. The pieces can be up to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) in height, width, and depth. Smaller pieces will also work, but you should avoid using pieces that are much bigger than that. Place the cucumber chunks into a food processor or blender. You should leave a couple of inches in between the top cucumber pieces and the rim of the machine. Do not fill the food processor to the top. Blend the cucumber pieces on a medium or high speed. Run the machine for approximately two minutes. The mixture should be pulpy, but it does not need to be smooth. Place a mesh strainer over a large bowl.

By resting the strainer on top of the bowl, you free up both hands. Alternatively, use a jelly bag instead. Place cheesecloth inside the strainer. The cloth will allow you to strain out more pulp. You can also line the strainer with coffee filters to create the same effect. Slowly pour the blended cucumbers through the strainer. Pour as much of the cucumber puree into the strainer as possible without causing the puree to overflow.

By stirring the cucumbers, you encourage the juice to seep out and flow through the strainers, into the bowl. Continue stirring and pressing until no more juice comes out. Pour the cucumber juice into glasses, chill, and serve. You can also store fresh cucumber juice in a sealed container inside the refrigerator for one week. Sweetened Cucumber Juice Peel, slice, and chop the cucumbers. Use a peeler to remove the waxy skin and a knife to chop off the ends. Cube the cucumbers with a knife to make them easier to work with. Grate your cucumber chunks into fine shreds. You can either use a hand grater or a box grater, depending one whichever is easiest for you to work with.

Blend it on a high speed until it resembles a puree with very few noticeable chunks of cucumber remaining. Blending releases more of the juice trapped inside the cucumber. Spread cheesecloth inside of a large glass bowl. The cheesecloth should be large enough to drape over the sides of the bowl. Carefully pour the pureed cucumbers into the cheesecloth. Go slowly to prevent the sides of the cheesecloth from slipping down into the puree. Once the puree is inside cheesecloth, bring the sides of the cheesecloth together into a tight bundle. Knot the cloth or tie it to secure the ends in place. Allow the cucumber juice to drain out of the cheesecloth and into the glass bowl. Once the juice stops dripping out on its own, squeeze the cheesecloth pouch to wring out any excess. When squeezing the pouch no longer produces juice, remove the cheesecloth and discard or save as desired. Add salt, to taste, into the cucumber juice. Stir to combine.

Serve the cucumber juice in glasses, either chilled or with ice. Save any extra inside the refrigerator up to a week.",
