You don\u2019t have to put in the orange juice unless you\u2019d like a slightly sweeter, more tart taste.Tip: You can also put 1/8 tsp (4 g) of cinnamon into the mixture if you aren\u2019t using stewed prunes to relieve constipation. Cinnamon will harden up your stool, not soften it, but it will make your stewed prunes tastier. To make spiced prunes, add 1 tsp (5 g) of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp (5 g) of ground cloves, 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) of ground ginger, and 3 tablespoons (44 mL) of lemon juice instead of orange juice."
