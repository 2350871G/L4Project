    "text": " Preparing the Plexiglas Choose a solid workspace. Your workspace should be made of wood, metal, or concrete. Grass or paper are not good choices, as the Plexiglas could adhere to these materials. Cut the Plexiglas, if necessary. Prepare the pieces to be joined by cutting them to the proper size and shape. Acrylic glass that is a quarter inch (6.3 mm) or thicker is best cut with a table saw or miter saw.

Set the acrylic glass in place for gluing. Once you have cleaned the pieces, fit them together as they will be joined. After ensuring a snug fit, secure the pieces together with either masking tape or clamps. Applying the Glue Apply the glue to the joint. The glue must be applied with a syringe, because it is water-thin and works by melting the acrylic to bond two pieces together. Using a 25 gauge syringe, apply a small amount of methylene chloride (such as Weld-On #3) to the joint between the two acrylic glass pieces, drawing the syringe toward you rather than pushing it away.
