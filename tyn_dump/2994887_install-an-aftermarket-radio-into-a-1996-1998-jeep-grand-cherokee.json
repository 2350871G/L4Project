    "text": " Open your Jeep's hood and disconnect the negative (-) battery terminal off of your Jeep's battery. Doing this will ensure you do not do damage to yourself, the new radio, or your vehicle. This will also ensure that you do not blow any fuses in the vehicle in the process of installing your new radio into your Jeep. With your hands, gently pull off the wooden bezel surrounding the HVAC system controls and vehicle wiper and heated seat control panel. Set it aside. Remove three (3) Philips-head screws. A Philips-head screw holds in one side of the HVAC system controls and one side of the vehicle wiper and heated seat control panel, a Philips-head screw holds the vehicle wiper and heated seat control panel in place, and the other Philips-head screw holds the HVAC controls in place. Set these screws aside, as you'll need them later. With your hands, gently pry off the wooden bezel surrounding the vehicle lighting control panel. Set it aside. Remove the two (2) Philips-head screws holding the vehicle lighting control panel in place. Set them aside, as you'll need them later. Remove five (5) Philips-head screws holding the instrument cluster and center stack surround bezel in place. Set them aside, as you'll need them later. Pull gently on the instrument cluster and center stack surround to remove it. Set it aside. Remove two (2) bolts securing the factory radio in place. A bolt is located in the upper right-hand corner of the factory radio, and another bolt is located in the lower left-hand corner of the factory radio. Set these aside, as you'll need them later. Pull the factory radio out of your Jeep's dashboard, and disconnect the black and gray wiring harnesses, radio ground wire, and AM/FM radio antenna from the back of the factory radio. Set the factory radio aside. Connect the factory wiring harness adapter's wires to the wires on the wiring harness that came with your new radio in the following order, using electrical tape each time to secure each set of wires together:  Connect the negative (-) right rear speaker wires together (purple w/ black stripe).  Connect the negative (-) left rear speaker wires together (green w/ black stripe).  Connect the positive (+) right front speaker wires together (gray).  Connect the positive (+) left front speaker wires together (white).  Connect the positive (+) right rear speaker wires together (purple).  Connect the positive (+) left rear speaker wires together (green).  If your Jeep has the factory Infinity Gold premium sound system (Infinity Gold logo on both front door speaker grilles), connect the blue wires together for the remote amplifier turn-on wire. If your Jeep does not have the factory Infinity Gold premium sound system, then cut off the bare end of the blue remote amplifier turn-on wires. Connect the positive (+) 12-volt battery power wires together (yellow).  Connect the positive (+) ignition power wires together (red).  Connect the negative (-) right front speaker wires together (gray w/ black stripe).  Connect the negative (-) left front speaker wires together (white w/ black stripe).  For the ground connection, crimp a metal spade to the ground connection on the factory wiring harness adapter and connect that wire to the factory ground wire so it makes a secure connection. If you do not have a metal spade, cut off the metal spade on the factory ground wire and connect that wire directly to the ground connection on the factory wiring harness adapter and hold it in place with electrical tape. This is a very important step, as not doing so may cause damage to yourself, your vehicle, or the new radio, and may cause fuses to blow in the process. Use the removal keys that came with your new radio to remove your new radio from its metal mounting sleeve. Save the removal keys in case you decide to remove your radio later and reinstall the factory radio. Place the mounting sleeve that came with your new radio into the plastic mounting adapter kit until the metal meets the plastic.  Place your new radio into the metal mounting sleeve and plastic mounting adapter.  Connect the gray and black wiring harnesses on the factory wiring harness adapter to the gray and black wiring harnesses from your Jeep's dashboard until they secure into place.  Connect the factory AM/FM radio antenna to the AM/FM radio antenna port on your new radio until it is securely in place.  Connect the wiring harness that came with your new radio to the connection on the back of your new radio until it is securely in place.  Secure the plastic mounting adapter kit to your Jeep's dashboard with the two (2) bolts you removed earlier.  Reinstall the instrument cluster and center stack surround bezel and hold it in place with the Philips-head screws you removed earlier.  Reinstall the vehicle lighting control panel Philips-head screw.  Place the wooden bezel around the vehicle lighting control panel and push gently to secure it in place.  Secure the HVAC control and vehicle wiper and heated seat control panel Philips-head screws.  Place the wooden bezel around the HVAC controls and vehicle wiper and heated seat control and push gently to secure it in place.  Reconnect the negative (-) battery wire to your Jeep's battery and shut your Jeep's hood.  Install the new radio's faceplate onto your new radio. Turn on your Jeep's ignition, and enjoy the tunes!
