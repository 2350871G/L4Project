Cut open a brown paper lunch bag and lay it flat over the area where the melted crayon is. Put the iron on its lowest heat setting and press it onto the paper bag. You should start to see the wax become absorbed by the paper bag. Do this for a minute or two, or until the wax looks and feels more like a liquid. You can also do this with paper towels instead of paper bags. You can also melt the wax with a hair dryer or a fabric steamer. If you don\u2019t have access to an outlet and it\u2019s hot outside, park your car in the sun. Roll your window down and let the sun beam in for 30 minutes or an hour. This may help liquify the wax. Before touching it, test the temperature of the crayon wax by holding the back of your hand about 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from it. If it hurts at all to hold your hand this close to the wax, don\u2019t touch it."
