Allow it to run a few turns. After few seconds of running the processor, switch it off. Wash with cold water and dish washing detergent. Give the processor a sniff. You should find that your processor is now deodorized. If not, repeat; it should be better by the second time. Using vinegar to clean the food processor Pour half a cup of white vinegar into the food processor bowl. Add a quarter teaspoon of your usual dish washing detergent. Pour in warm water to near the top of the food processor bowl. Place the processor lid on and set aside. Leave for an hour or two. During this time, the vinegar will absorb the pepper odor from the plastic. Tip the water and vinegar solution out. Wash the processor as usual. Give it the sniff test; if it's odorless, you're good to go. If not, repeat but allow the soaking to occur for 8 to 12 hours, then rinse. That will be sufficient to remove the odor. Using charcoal to clean the food processor Place a small piece of charcoal into the food processor bowl.  Put the lid on top. Let stand for a few hours, or overnight if possible. Remove the piece of charcoal from the food processor bowl. Wash as usual with standard dish washing detergent. Rinse well. Give it the sniff test. The odors should now be removed. Using baking soda to clean the food processor Add half a cup of baking soda to the food processor bowl.  Fill with warm water to the top of the food processor bowl. Stir a little to combine. Place the lid on the top of the food processor. Allow to sit soaking for several hours or overnight. Tip the baking soda water out. Wash with dish washing detergent and rinse properly. Give it the sniff test. The baking soda should have absorbed the odor. If not, repeat.",
