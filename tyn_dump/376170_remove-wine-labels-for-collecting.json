Soaking in Hot Water Fill a large pot with hot water. Boil enough water to fill a stockpot about 2/3 of the way up.

You can use hot water from the tap instead, but it might not be as effective as just-boiled water. Submerge the empty, uncorked bottle in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes.

        "If you\u2019re using a 2-piece pasta pot, lower the colander insert into the base.",
        "Then, stand the wine bottle up inside the colander.",
        "Unless you\u2019re using a colander insert, you\u2019ll need to manually hold the bottle over the water while it steams to avoid getting it wet.",
        "Peel off the label using a utility knife and oven gloves.",
        "The glass will be hot after having sat over the steam for a while, so make sure you\u2019re wearing oven gloves.",
        "With the tip of a utility knife or razor blade, gently lift up one corner of the wine label.",
        "If it doesn\u2019t budge, expose the bottle to the steam for another 10 or 15 minutes.",
        "Once it starts to come loose, slowly lift off the entire label.",
        "Once the adhesive has softened, the label should come off easily in one piece.",
        "Air-dry the label on a sheet of parchment paper.",
        "If the label ends up being slightly damp after having been exposed to the steam, allow it to air-dry overnight.",
        "Set it on a sheet of parchment paper with the adhesive-side up.",
        "This will allow the glue to harden while the front of the label dries off.",
        "This is a useful technique to use on labels that you don\u2019t want to submerge in water.",
        "Soaking in Hot Water Fill a large pot with hot water.",
        "Boil enough water to fill a stockpot about 2/3 of the way up.",
        "Make sure you use enough water to completely cover the entire wine label once you set the bottle into the pot.",
        "You can use hot water from the tap instead, but it might not be as effective as just-boiled water.",
        "Submerge the empty, uncorked bottle in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Stand up the bottle in the pot full of hot water.",
        "If necessary, add a little more water so that the top of the label is covered by the water.",
        "Leave it to soak for about 10 to 15 minutes or so.",
        "If desired, you can purchase a chlorinated soap from a wine store that\u2019s designed to help to dissolve the adhesive.",
        "Be sure to follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions so you use the product correctly.",
        "Remove the bottle from the hot water and dry it off.",
        "Put on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves to provide some grip and protect your hands from the hot water.",
        "Use caution as you lift out the wine bottle as it will be hot.",
        "Dry off the outside of the bottle with a towel.",
        "Peel off the damp label using the edge of a utility knife.",
        "Once the bottle is dry, slide the blade of a utility knife underneath one of the corners of the label.",
        "Once it starts to come loose, carefully peel up the rest of the label.",
        "Work slowly to avoid tearing the label.",
        "The hot water soak will have softened up the adhesive, so you should be able to preserve the label in one piece.",
        "Be careful not to rub or scratch the damp paper as it will easily get damaged.",
        "Allow the label to air-dry overnight.",
        "Set the damp label on a piece of parchment paper face-down, if you want the adhesive to dry.",
        "Or, set it glue-side down onto a sheet of regular paper if you\u2019d rather mount the label or preserve it in a journal.",
        "The moist glue will adhere to the paper.",
        "Leave the paper to air-dry overnight.",
        "If the label curls up while it dries, you can press it flat within the pages of a heavy book once it\u2019s totally dry."
