There are several types of bridge construction. Think about what you want yours to look like. Most balsa bridges are types of truss bridges or arch bridges, as the wood lends itself well to this type of construction. Plus, these are two of the simpler types of bridges to engineer. Truss bridges are type of beam bridge supported by crossing posts above the bridge, and arch bridges are supported by large arches below the roadway of the bridge. Trusses have triangular frames of varying frequencies. Different types of bridges carry loads differently. When thinking about your design, you can build your own based on a type of bridge, e.g. truss or arch, or simply find a template for the type of bridge you want to build online and print this instead of using your drawings."

Making the Pieces of Your Bridge Spread your drawing out on the foam board. For this, you want to use your drawing showing the side of your balsa bridge. This will be your guide for piecing your bridge together. Use pieces of masking tape to tack down the drawing of the side of your bridge. Cut a piece of sheer parchment paper larger than the foam board. Tuck its edges around the back of the board and tape them. The parchment paper keeps glue off of your drawing and allows you to use it to create both sides of your bridge. Cut your balsa wood strips. You can use the measurements on your drawings or just use the drawings as a template to mark each measurement with a pencil. Cutting your own strips from sheets will save you money. Use your woodcutter in conjunction with a straight edge. Make sure to account for all the pieces you\u2019ll need: truss pieces, lateral bracing, and the roadway. Organize your materials. After you\u2019ve cut all your pieces, organize them into piles based on which part of your bridge they represent.

Use the drawing you\u2019ve created, and lay each strip of wood where it needs to be on the drawing. To keep pieces secure while you lay them out, stick two sewing pins into the foam board at each joint. Cross them over the wood to secure it.

After that, remove it from your foam board template, and repeat the process for the other side of the bridge. Glue the two sides to the roadway. Before you start to glue, pin your roadway to the foam board. Put a thin line of glue on each edge of the roadway. Push your sides against the roadway. Use straight pins around the edges of the sides to keep them in place while the bridge dries. Add your lateral bracing. The lateral bracings of the bridge are the cross sections, often forming \u201cX\u201ds, on top of the trusses. While your bridge is still supported by pins around its sides, glue on your lateral braces. If you need to, you can use clothespins as tiny clamps. Again, let your bridge dry for as long as possible.
