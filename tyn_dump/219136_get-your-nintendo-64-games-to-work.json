    "text": " Testing the console Try turning the console off for a few minutes. Sometimes it can get overheated. If you've been playing for a while, touch the console. If it's really warm, then maybe it's time to give your Nintendo 64 a break. Make sure all the AV cable is fully in. Push it in hard to make sure it can give off some signal. If it still doesn't work, get some new a new AV cable. See if the cartilage is fully in the slot. Try pushing it down a little harder to make sure it's really able to read it. Because if it's only half reading it, the N64 just gets stuck. Cleaning the console Physically blow inside of the console. However, in doing this, be aware that you risk getting saliva in it, which may oxide the pins; do this at your own risk. Use canned air in the console where the game goes in. This gets rid of the dust. You can also try to use it in the port. Try diluting alcohol with water, 50-50. Take a Q-tip and dip one side in the solution and rub the contacts of the game itself. Dry off the contacts with the dry side or let them air dry. Repeat this until the Q-tip doesn't get dirty after touching the contacts. Fixing the games for N64 Open the game by undoing the two hex screws. Do not lose these; place in a resealable bag and set aside. Inside the cartridge is a small metal panel with two small screws. Undo these as well. Once undone, gently pry open the metal casing. Inside is a chipboard. Remove the plastic strip at the bottom of the cartridge. Also remove the chipboard from the case. Once accomplished, using the can of cleaner from about 25 centimeter (9.8 in) away, spray the board completely.  You will notice the pins are faded. These games were not made to last so long, so the conductive gold etched into the board has faded away. After wiping all residue and ensuring the circuit area is clean, especially where the bottom pins are, it is time to prep the circuit writer pen. Using the circuit writer, on both sides of the chipboard, recoat all the pins pointing out of the bottom of the cartridge. Cover and fill in all the pits and faded areas. Ensure that you do not make two pins contact into each other, as the ink is conductive and it will cause a short circuit if done incorrectly. Let it dry for about 10 to 15 minutes. Once done, reassemble the game. Test. The game should work without having to jam and push the cartridge into the console.",
