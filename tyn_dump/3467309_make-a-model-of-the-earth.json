If you want to hang the globe, ask an adult to help you cut a hole in the top and hang it from twine. Modeling the Earth's Layers Cut a Styrofoam ball in half. Get a Styrofoam ball from a craft store. Cut it in half with an adult's help. Now you can see the inside of the Earth, so you can show its layers. Glue a Styrofoam semicircle onto the ball. Take the half of the ball you're not using. Cut out a section from the middle, in a semicircular shape. Glue this to the center of the half-Earth, so there's a bump coming out of it. This is the inner core, a solid ball formed from the pressure of the layers around it. Color this red with paint or markers. Draw the outer core. Draw a large circle around the inner core, on the flat half of the globe. This should take up about \u2153 to \u00bd the space on that surface. Color it orange and call it the outer core. Draw the mantle. Color the rest of the flat surface yellow, leaving only a tiny sliver of uncolored land at the edge. Label this the mantle. The mantle is actually made up the upper mantle (solid rock) and the lower mantle (liquid rock). Divide it into two different shades of orange if you like. Label the crust. The crust is the surface layer of the Earth, and it is very thin compared to the other layers. Color this brown or black. On your model, it will look like a thin line around the entire cut surface. Together, the upper mantle and the crust make up the lithosphere. Showing the Solar System Glue the model to a foam board. Make one of the two models described above. Once you're finished, glue it to a large piece of foam board or cardboard. Paint the board black. Color the foam board black to show outer space. Add the stars. You can use stick-on stars, or cover the background with glitter glue or glitter paint. Make the moon. Find a golf ball or a crumpled up piece of paper, about \u00bc the size of your Earth model. Glue it on the board, close to the Earth. Add the planets. Crumple up another piece of paper for each of the planets. Glue them onto the board in this order:\nMercury \u2014 small, grey\nVenus \u2014 yellow, about Earth sized\nEarth (your model)\nMars \u2014 red, about Earth sized\nJupiter \u2014 orange and white, the biggest planet\nSaturn \u2014 yellow, almost as big as Jupiter, with rings around it\nUranus \u2014 light blue, bigger than Earth but smaller than Saturn\nNeptune \u2014 light blue, about the size of Uranus\nPluto \u2014 a tiny grey dot Add the sun. Closest to Mercury, the sun is an enormous yellow-orange ball. The sun is much too big for you to show its size accurately. You can either make the biggest ball you can fit, or just color a corner of the board yellow to indicate that the sun expands far beyond the edges.",
