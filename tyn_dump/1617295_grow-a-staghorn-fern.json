Be careful to keep the spore pile on the piece of paper. You can also purchase spores in little packets from nurseries if you don't have access to a fern leaf. Tap the paper with your finger to separate out the spore casings. Hold the piece of paper flat in front of you and tap the bottom with one finger several times. The casings that the spores were in will begin to separate out, while the spores cling to the paper. Dispose of the casings and keep the spores on the paper to sow right away.

Transplanting and Caring for Staghorn Ferns Transplant ferns once you see fronds. As soon as you see fronds forming on your ferns, use tweezers to carefully pluck a fern out that you want to transplant. Be careful not to destroy the root system.

Keeping the soil too wet will cause your fern to rot, so make sure to wait until the soil is dry before you water it. This may be once a week in moderate temperatures, or more often in hot temperatures. Pour enough water over the base of the fern to saturate the roots and the soil, but don't leave any standing water. Apply water only to the soil to avoid black spot. Avoid misting your fern. Staghorn ferns are susceptible to a fungus called black spot, and the moisture left on the fronds from misting is often the culprit. Fertilize once a month with half-strength fertilizer. Find a commercial fern fertilizer at a garden center or nursery and mix it with water to cut down on the strength. Pour a spray bottle half full of fertilizer and fill the other half with water. Then follow the product instructions for application. Mounting a Staghorn Fern Find a plank of wood larger than the base of your fern. When your fern has matured and has reached a few inches wide and tall, you can mount it on the wall. Find a piece of wood that you like the look of, and make sure it's longer and wider than the base of your fern. Install hanging hardware to the back of the wood. Purchase a pack of hardware used for hanging heavy pictures or mirrors. Before you begin mounting the fern, attach the hardware to the back of your piece of wood where you'd like it to attach to the wall. Trace a circle in the middle of the wood. Use a cup or a bowl that's about the width of the base of your fern. Place it in the middle of the wood and trace a circle with a pen or marker. You can also move it a little up or down if you don't want it exactly in the middle. Hammer in nails all the way around the circle. Get eight or so small nails and hammer them along the edge of the circle you traced, spacing them evenly. If your circle was large, you may need more than eight nails.

        "Avoid misting your fern.",
        "Staghorn ferns are susceptible to a fungus called black spot, and the moisture left on the fronds from misting is often the culprit.",
        "Fertilize once a month with half-strength fertilizer.",
        "Find a commercial fern fertilizer at a garden center or nursery and mix it with water to cut down on the strength.",
        "Pour a spray bottle half full of fertilizer and fill the other half with water.",
        "Then follow the product instructions for application.",
        "Mounting a Staghorn Fern Find a plank of wood larger than the base of your fern.",
        "When your fern has matured and has reached a few inches wide and tall, you can mount it on the wall.",
        "Find a piece of wood that you like the look of, and make sure it's longer and wider than the base of your fern.",
        "Install hanging hardware to the back of the wood.",
        "Purchase a pack of hardware used for hanging heavy pictures or mirrors.",
        "Before you begin mounting the fern, attach the hardware to the back of your piece of wood where you'd like it to attach to the wall.",
        "Trace a circle in the middle of the wood.",
        "Use a cup or a bowl that's about the width of the base of your fern.",
        "Place it in the middle of the wood and trace a circle with a pen or marker.",
        "You can also move it a little up or down if you don't want it exactly in the middle.",
        "Hammer in nails all the way around the circle.",
        "Get eight or so small nails and hammer them along the edge of the circle you traced, spacing them evenly.",
        "If your circle was large, you may need more than eight nails.",
        "Leave less than a centimeter of nail poking up out of the wood.",
        "Place your pruned fern inside the circle of nails.",
        "Gently pull your staghorn fern from its pot or container and place the whole root system in the middle of the nails.",
        "Prune the roots back a little with scissors or shears so that they fit inside the circle.",
        "Cover the base of the fern with peat moss.",
        "Dampen handfuls of peat moss and wrap them around the base of your fern, covering the roots.",
        "Make sure the peat moss is damp enough that it sticks where you press it down.",
        "Tie the fern down by crisscrossing twine around the nails.",
        "Take burlap twine or baker's twine and tie a knot on one end.",
        "Tie that knot around one of the nails, and then start crisscrossing the twine over the peat moss.",
        "Wrap it around a nail on one side of the plant before crossing back over the roots to tie it on a nail on the other side.",
        "Continue until you feel like the plant is secure.",
        "Hang your fern in bright, indirect sunlight.",
        "Find a spot in your home to hang the fern where it won't receive any direct sunlight.",
        "Indirect natural light and steady, mild temperatures are best.",
        "Water the mounted fern once a week in the shower.",
        "Water your staghorn fern by taking the mount off the wall and placing the entire thing in the shower.",
        "Spray water over it for about ten minutes and then allow it to drip dry.",
        "Brush off excess moisture from both the wood and the fronds with a dry cloth, then rehang the fern.",
        "Prune the fern periodically to maintain its weight.",
        "Staghorn ferns can grow to well over 100 pounds (45 kg), which makes them impractical for mounting.",
        "To avoid needing to remove your fern from the wall, prune it periodically as the fronds begin to overwhelm the board.",
        "Use shears to cut fronds at their base, just above the crown of the fern.",
        "Never rip a frond off, as this can cause tissue damage to the crown tissues."
