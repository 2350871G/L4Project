Use a polish that\u2019s made for silver since other polishes could cause pitting or leave small scratches. Apply a pea-sized dab of the polish to a soft cleaning rag or cotton ball, and move the silverware back and forth to apply it. Once you polish the silverware, rinse it under cold water and dry it completely. You can buy silver polish from jewelry stores or online. If your silverware has intricate details on it, then use a soft-bristled toothbrush to work the polish into the hard-to-reach areas. You can also use toothpaste in place of silver polish if you want. Don\u2019t use a colored gel toothpaste since it may leave residue on your utensils."
