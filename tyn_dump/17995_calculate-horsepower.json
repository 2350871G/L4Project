Calculating the Horsepower of an Electric Motor Figure out the current (I), efficiency (Eff), and voltage (V) of the motor. The voltage of the motor will be expressed in volts, the current will be expressed in amps, and the efficiency will be expressed as a percentage. The motor should have these units of measurement written on it. Using the formula (V * I * Eff)/746=HP, determine your electric motor\u2019s horsepower.

Convert the efficiency into a decimal before calculating. For example, a 82% efficiency would equal .82. Calculating Your Own Horsepower Weigh yourself. Find out how much you weigh in pounds. Write your weight down. If your scale uses kilograms, multiply this number by 2.2 to find your weight in pounds. Find a stairway that is free from obstructions. You\u2019ll be running up these stairs with a stopwatch, so try to find a stairway that is not frequently used. Measure the total height of the stairs. First, find the height of one stair in feet. Then, count how many stairs are in the stairwell you will be running up. Multiply these two numbers, and you will have the total height of the stairs. Write down the height. If your ruler uses meters, multiply the height by 3.28 to convert the measurement into feet. Time how long it takes you to run up the stairs. Get a running start, and when your foot lands on the first step, start your stopwatch. When both feet are on the top step, stop your stopwatch.
