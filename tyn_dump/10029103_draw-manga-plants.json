Although manga styles certainly look cartoonish, a mangaka who knows how to take things from the real world and convert them into manga has an advantage over the rest.

This tutorial uses a lily as an example, so the shapes shown here might be different than the ones you need. Show a few spots for the stem, if you're going to draw it, the place where the petals meet, the petals themselves, and any leaves. Notate the direction of the petals with a few light lines. These will be erased later, so only make them light enough to see. The purpose of these is to provide a sort of skeleton for you to build off of when drawing the flower in later steps.
