Take your plastic container and fill it halfway with water. Then, fill the remainder of the container with white vinegar. Let the container soak for 12-24 hours. Rinse the container in water when you\u2019re done soaking it to remove your tomato stains.If you have a plastic spatula or some other plastic item, you can soak it in a glass filled with 1-part white vinegar and 1-part water. This method will work for basically any colored-food stain that remains after standard dishwashing."

Grab half of your lemon and hold it with the cut side facing the stain. Rub the cut side into the stained area by scrubbing it back and forth across the stained area. Squeeze the lemon gently as you scrub to release more lemon juice. Continue rubbing for 30-60 seconds. Rinse the stain off with water when you\u2019re done.Wear rubber gloves if you have any cuts on your hands or don\u2019t want your fingers to smell like lemon. This may work to remove oily tomato residue as well, since lemon juice is fairly good at fighting grease."
