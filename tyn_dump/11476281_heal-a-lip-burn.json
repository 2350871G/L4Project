However, if you have darkened skin, blisters, or numbness in your lips, it may be second-degree or third-degree burn and you need medical assistance. Go to the doctor as soon as you can so you can get proper treatment. Don\u2019t try to pop any blisters at home since they\u2019re more likely to get infected.
