Work carefully to avoid getting water on the lens or any openings, including the charging and memory card ports. Moisture and salt in the air settle on the surface of your camera. Also, be aware of sweat. If you open your camera without cleaning it first, these things can all get inside and damage delicate components. Dampen the cloth very lightly.
