        "You can then make whatever adjustments you think are necessary to get it right where you want it.",
        "If your picture looks like it\u2019s hanging too low on one side, just nudge the picture over to that side on the wire to bring it up.",
        "Don\u2019t let go of the picture until you\u2019re certain that it\u2019s secure on the nail.",
        "Use a level to confirm that your picture is nice and straight.",
        "Set the level down gently along the top of the frame.",
        "If you're using a conventional level, the bubble should be centered between the two lines of the viewing chamber.",
        "If you're working with a laser level, hold the tool on the wall adjacent to the picture at a 180-degree angle and adjust the top of the frame until it's in line with the light beam.",
        "Be careful not to accidentally knock the frame out of alignment while you're setting up your level.",
        "Hanging Multiple Frames Arrange your frames into neat rows.",
        "Mount your pictures down the length of the wall, making sure the top edges of the frames are aligned.",
        "For an off-kilter look that's still symmetrically pleasing, you can also trying centering smaller frames with the vertical edges of larger ones.",
        "When working with frames of various sizes, position your largest pieces towards the bottom lefthand side of the display area to create a more natural visual balance.",
        "If you plan on hanging other pieces above or below your row of pictures, take some time to consider the best way to group them all together visually.",
        "Space your frames with the aid of a tape measure.",
        "After hanging your first piece, decide how much space you want to leave between it and your next frame.",
        "Extend your tape measure along the wall from the outer edge of the frame that's already in place.",
        "Use a pencil or strip of tape to mark the distance and make it clear where you next frame will go.",
        "Taking the time to check the placement of your frames with a tape measure can help you ensure that your pictures are evenly spaced the first time, preventing you from having to make annoying micro-adjustments or take them down and start over.",
        "Mount multiple frames quickly using a paint stirrer and screw.",
        "Force a screw (any size will do) through the end of a wooden paint stirrer and hang the picture on the screw temporarily while you\u2019re deciding where to put it.",
        "Move the paint stirrer around until you\u2019re satisfied with the picture\u2019s position, then tap the screw to make a tiny mark on the wall.",
        "This mark will indicate where you\u2019ll drive the nail.",
        "Hanging pictures from the screw before choosing a spot for them will account for inconsistencies in wire length, making it possible to line up rows of same-sized frames quickly and with minimal error.Tip: Attempting to maneuver the picture and paint stirrer at the same time may be tricky.",
        "Have another person lend you a hand if possible.",
        "Use your frame\u2019s cardboard corner protectors as makeshift spacers.",
        "The corner pieces that Ribba frames are packaged with can double as an easy spacing aid for gallery walls.",
        "Once you\u2019re done hanging your first picture, turn a corner protector sideways so that it\u2019s the same width as the frame\u2019s face, hold it up to the outside edge of the frame, and mark the far end with a pencil.",
        "With this simple yet clever method, you\u2019ll end up with just the right amount of space between all of pictures with no need to measure each gap individually."
