If you have super glue on any of these other regions, see your doctor or visit an emergency room or urgent care as soon as possible. A doctor can most effectively remove super glue from the sensitive eye areas. In most cases, super glue will solidify on contact with saliva.

This can help to loosen the super glue and prepare your skin for removal. You can use any mild soap to flush your skin. Ensure that the water isn't too hot when rinsing your skin so that you don't burn it. Use a thermometer to check the water temperatures.
