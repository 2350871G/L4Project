Some games allow melee toys to be used. If so, it may be a good idea to bring an N-Force sword. However, some campuses ban them to try to maintain balance, so make sure to check the rules before you bring a sword. While it's nice to have some of the fancier blasters, a simpler blaster such as a Disruptor or Retaliator can hold you over quite well as long as you are careful. Make sure to bring lots of darts or other ammo, because HvZ events can last multiple days. Rolled up (clean!) socks are also a good idea to bring in case of running into a special zombie or simply having to reload or clear a jam. Some campuses allow you to modify your blaster. If so, it may be worthwhile to try and remove a few of the locks on your blaster. However, keep within the maximum range posted if there is one, and if the rules say to bring stock, always make sure to bring stock. Most games require you to have a visible bandanna (eg. a neon color) so teams can easily be distinguished. Humans usually wear the bandanna on their arm, while zombies usually wear the bandanna on their head. Some games also require you to have a card or dog tags for zombies to take to administrators so that you're noted as a zombie. If possible, see if there are communication channels for humans and zombies (eg. Gravemind, Discord channels that keep humans separated from zombies and vice-versa)\nA good pair of running shoes is a must for both humans and zombies.

Try to work on improving your awareness, reload speed, running speed, dodging, and accuracy. Awareness will keep you from walking into traps. It's always better to be overly cautious than not cautious enough. Reload speed lowers the amount of time you are vulnerable as a human. Running speed keeps zombies away from you as a human, and as a zombie, allows you to get close to a human. Dodging allows a human to avoid a zombie tag and shoot the zombie, while a zombie can dodge darts to try to tag a human. Accuracy is probably the most important, because if you fire a perfect outline of zombies, the only thing you're actually hitting is your foot. Try to learn how to shoot somewhat accurately while running so that you can utilize both the human's range and your mobility."
