Thick smoke reduces visibility and increases the chance of collision with other vehicles, livestock, trees or other objects when you cannot see ahead. Low beam headlights work best in smoky conditions; high beams can blind you if they reflect back off the smoke. If you have fog lights, both the front and rear ones should be turned on. Be aware that if your car has daytime running lights, you may need to turn the headlights on manually; this will also turn on the tail lights."

Driving more slowly gives you a better reaction time, potentially helping to avoid a collision. Be cautious and aware of other road users around you.

Be actively conscious of anything bright or reflective; this may be a human being standing on the road for fire fighting or traffic direction purposes. Avoid sudden stops.

Be aware that continuing to drive can increase the risk of a collision, which can result in injury or death and if your vehicle is damaged, this can weaken its use as your last form of shelter. Keep your headlights and hazard lights (emergency flashers) on while parked. This will increase the chances of being seen by other drivers, many of whom may also wish to pull over and stop. Even if the smoke is light enough to see through, stopping is a good idea to help you assess a safe way forward. If stopping puts you at risk of being in the actual fire, implement your plan for staying safe in the car during a fire. Be aware that the smoke will gradually fill the car. To help increase your chances of survival, keep all windows rolled up and all doors shut. Shut all vents and turn off air-conditioning. If you have wool blankets, hang them over windows (use the coat handles on the car ceiling or drape over dashboard to front seats and front seats to back seats). Drop lower than the windows and to help you inhale as little smoke as possible, keep as close to the floor as you can. To help you breathe as this happens, breathe through a cloth that has been moistened with your drinking water."

        "Suitable masks will be marked as P2 or N95.",
        "For help in choosing and wearing your mask properly, check out: How to Wear an N95 Face Mask.",
        "Pack a wool blanket.",
        "Have at least 1 wool blanket in the car, which can be used to put up against windows to protect you from smoke and flames if you have to stop and stay with the vehicle or drive through active fire zones.",
        "Wool has natural flame resistance and even if it does catch fire, it will smolder and not melt onto skin.",
        "There are also fire blankets treated with fire retardant that can be purchased online or from stores stocking safety supplies, if you prefer.",
        "Old wool blankets can be purchased from charity stores.",
        "Having dedicated emergency blankets not needed for your bedding means they can be left in your car or with your emergency kit for use at any time.",
        "Wipe the windshield (windscreen) clean before leaving on your journey.",
        "This will help to avoid trying to see through grime as well as smoke.",
        "It can be helpful to wipe down the windshield occasionally as you\u2019re traveling (if safe to do so), to maintain the best visibility.",
        "Use your fire information app to stay on top of the latest information.",
        "For example, in New South Wales, the Fires Near Me app keeps people informed about what is happening in local bushfires, enabling you to make informed decisions.",
        "Listen to your emergency radio frequency for constant updates.",
        "This will vary from country to country, so be aware of what the frequency is well ahead of any disaster event.",
        "This may vary between dedicated emergency channels, national broadcasters, and local stations.",
        "As well as using your local emergency services apps, Twitter can be a good up-to-date source from local people feeding in photos and current information.",
        "Use the hashtag #[yourcity/area]fires, this will usually provide a stream of advisories and help from online users.",
        "However, be conscious of the potential for inaccuracies in information and use the emergency services apps and sites for confirmation.",
        "If you are aware of fires in the area, keep your phone(s) charging at all times, so they\u2019re fully charged if you do need to evacuate.",
        "Take a car charger with you as well.",
        "Be aware that solar chargers may not work if smoke is clouding out the sun."
