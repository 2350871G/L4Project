        "You may not see these pests at first, but if you see holes chewed through the leaves of your plants, they are the likely culprit.",
        "Stop diseases from ravaging your collards.",
        "Collards are fairly hardy plants, but they can still be impacted by a few diseases.",
        "Keeping the plants in well-drained soil will prevent clubroot, which can cause plants to wither or not produce leaves.",
        "Spots on the leaves indicate a fungus, which can be treated with neem oil, sulfur, or another fungicide.",
        "Avoiding planting collards in the same soil in successive years prevents other diseases, including:\nBlack leg\nBlack rot\nYellows Let a light frost cover your plants before harvesting.",
        "Collards actually taste sweeter if they are allowed to frost over before harvesting.",
        "Generally, however, collards are ready to harvest anywhere between 40 to 85 days after germination.",
        "For best results, harvest anytime after the first frost has come and gone.",
        "You can pick collards when they are frozen in the ground.",
        "However, be gentle with the plants because their leaves become brittle when frozen.",
        "Clip whole plants or pick individual leaves.",
        "Cut the whole plant about 4 inches (10 cm) from the ground.",
        "Alternatively, pick single leaves, working from the bottom up so that new ones will grow.",
        "Either way is a fine method for harvesting collard greens, but picking off individual leaves means your plants will keep producing throughout the growing season.",

        "After draining them well, you can add garlic or lemon juice to the collards to enhance their flavor.\u201d Replant collard greens the next year, if necessary.",
        "If you only pick individual leaves from your plants (and not the entire plant at once), your collard greens may continue to grow the next year.",
        "However, this will depend on the climate in your area.",
        "Collards can tolerate frosts, but if winter temperatures/conditions are severe, you may need to replant the greens next year."
