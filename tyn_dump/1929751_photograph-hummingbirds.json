                    "description": "Hummingbirds are drawn to the brightly-colored feeders and sweet liquid inside, so if you hang one near your home in the warm summer months, you'll soon have a handful of birds coming by to eat every day. Position the feeder in a location where you can see it easily (e.g., in front of a kitchen window) so you'll know when the birds are coming by to eat. Then, grab your camera! If you happen to have more than 1 feeder already in place, take 1 down. You should only have 1 feeder hanging, so that all of the birds congregate in a single location."

                    "description": "Hummingbirds are skittish and easily frightened off by humans walking around. In order to let the birds get used to you being nearby, sit or stand between 10\u201315 feet (3.0\u20134.6 m) away from the feeder. Photographing hummingbirds takes patience. Plan to sit still (though not completely motionless) for at least 15\u201330 minutes before the birds are comfortable enough to start feeding. If it's a sunny day and you don't have other plans, you could even take a lawn chair out to the hummingbird feeder! You may need to spend several hours around the feeder anyway, waiting for the birds to arrive and taking various photos before you get a great one."

Then, tear off 3 or 4 strips of scotch tape and use them to cover the feeder's holes, leaving only 1 open. This will ensure that the birds all feed at the exact same location, making it easier to set up your camera to take high-quality photos. With the perches removed and most of the holes blocked, you know where the bird will be and it will be much easier to position your shot."

Being a little farther than 10 feet (3.0 m) from the birds will allow you to compose the shots as you like. The distance will also let you focus on the bird without the background of the photograph overwhelming the subject. If your particular setup doesn't allow you to situate the tripod this far from the feeder, don't worry. You can always zoom out more with your lens if you're closer, or crop out blank space around the bird if you're too far away."

Otherwise, if your tripod happens to be positioned closer to the feeder, using a regular 35 mm lens will be fine. If your camera doesn't already have a good-quality lens, you can purchase one at a photography store. Telephoto lenses also have another perk: in letting you shoot from farther away, they lower the likelihood that you'll spook the birds when you start snapping pictures. More experienced photographers may even choose to use a wide-angle or fisheye lens and position the tripod only about 10\u201312 inches (25\u201330 cm) away from the birds. Since this would put you extremely close to the birds, you'd need to trigger the camera shutter remotely."

Position your flashes so they're only 1\u20133 feet (0.30\u20130.91 m) away from the birdfeeder, and set them to low power. You only want each flash to be at about 1/16 of its full strength so that the flashes don't over-expose the birds' colorful bodies. Depending on the height of your birdfeeder, you may need to set up the flashes on their own small tripods. Lighting the scene with flashes will ensure that you have consistently good lighting regardless of the time of day you're shooting at. In most cases, if you're shooting during the daylight hours, hummingbirds shouldn't be scared off by flashes. This step is technically optional. If you prefer to work without flashes, or if you're shooting in an area with bright, indirect sunlight, you may not need a flash at all."

If you're shooting with film, you can purchase rolls of 400 or 800 ISO film at a photography outlet store.

Hummingbirds will be flying much too fast for you to try to manually focus your lens on them, and using the autofocus will let you focus on timing and composing the shot. If you're using a cheaper non-SLR camera, you can typically engage the autofocus feature by pressing the shutter button halfway down."

If you use too slow of a speed, you'll notice that the birds' wings are blurry and hard to see. In some cases, to avoid blurry wings on a fast-flying hummingbird, you'll need to use a shutter speed of at least 1/2500 of a second to freeze the birds in motion. Depending on the aesthetic of the photo you're trying to take, you may actually want the bird's wings to look blurry. In this case, use a slightly slower shutter speed to capture the wings' motion. Try a handful of different shutter speeds to see what works best. You could shoot 50 pictures at 1 shutter speed, then adjust it and shoot 50 more."

Manually set the aperture to f/1.4, f/4, or f/5 to prevent the shots from being dim and poorly lit. Using a fast shutter speed and a wide aperture means that you'll have a low depth of field, so the scenery behind the hummingbird will likely be out of focus. On some SLC cameras, the aperture is referred to as the f-stop. These terms mean the same thing."

This will dramatically improve your chances of having 1 or 2 great photos you can be proud of. If you have a digital SLR camera, you could also try engaging the function that lets you take 3-5 photos in rapid succession. You could also try shooting a video of a hummingbird feeding and then select the best still video frame. If you're shooting with a digital camera, just make sure that you've cleared off enough memory on the device that you can fit hundreds of new photos.
