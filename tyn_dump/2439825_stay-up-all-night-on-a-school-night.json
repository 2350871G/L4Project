If you don't pull many all-nighters, a box of individually packaged instant coffees, like the ones from Starbucks, will likely do. These are also good to keep in backpacks, purses, wallets, cars, etc. for if you are dozing off when you're out. If you pull frequent all nighters, you may want to buy a large container of inexpensive instant coffee and keep it in your room. Before you use it in an all-nighter, be sure you have something to scoop and stir with.
