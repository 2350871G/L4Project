Lay the 3 shutters across 2 sawhorses with the top edges aligned. Clamp them together in several places so that they will not move while you do any necessary repairs. Examine the shutters and repair as necessary, using wood putty to fill in holes or cracks. Sand smooth and, if desired, apply the finish of your choice. Allow the finish to dry, periodically opening and shutting the louvers so they do not get fixed in 1 position. Lay 2 shutters side-by-side, face-up, on a worktable. Measure down approximately 12 in. (30.5 cm) from the top right side of the 1st shutter and make a pencil mark. Measure the same distance from the bottom of the shutter and make another mark. These marks are where your hinges will be placed. Align the middle hole of 1 hinge on the top mark, and use that as a guide to mark the other 2 holes of the hinge. Repeat on the bottom hinge and on the left side of the 2nd door. Pre-drill screw holes with an electric drill, and fasten the hinges on the front of the 1st 2 shutters using a screwdriver or your electric drill fitted with a screwdriver bit.  Turn the shutters face down with the 2 already hinged together on your right side. Attach the hinges for these shutters exactly as you did before except that these go on the back so that the screen can fold properly.
