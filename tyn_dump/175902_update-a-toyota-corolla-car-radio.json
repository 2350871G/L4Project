Another important thing to consider when upgrading your head unit is what aftermarket unit will fit best. Head units come in three sizes - Single DIN, DIN and a half, and Double DIN. If your unit is Single DIN it will likely be compatible with most aftermarket head units. Otherwise you may need a mounting kit for your vehicle. Get a wiring harness or adaptor.

Do you need the ability to play CDs? Do you want to hook up an MP3 player? The type of media that you wish to play will be crucial in helping you decide the best kind of adaptor to buy. Know your adaptor options. There are several types of accessories and adaptors available to allow you to listen to a more varied media collection.

Start your car, but keep it in park. Also, do this in a well ventilated area. It is dangerous to leave a car running in a closed space. Insert the flashdrive into the car\u2019s USB port. If your car does not have a USB port, it is not likely Entune capable. Select \u2018YES\u2019 when prompted to update the software. When your system recognizes the Entune update file, it will ask you to confirm the update. Allow the update to complete. Do not turn off the car or drive until the update is complete.
