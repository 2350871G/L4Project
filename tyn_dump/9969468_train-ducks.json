This will give them a chance to get familiar with their new surroundings. Before long, they\u2019ll begin to identify the pen as a safe shelter to return to. Make sure the pen you have set up is large enough to comfortably house all of the ducks you\u2019re keeping. A good rule of thumb is to provide at least 4 square feet (about 0.37 square meters) of space per animal. It's also possible to train adult ducks to free range, although it may take them a little longer to catch on."
