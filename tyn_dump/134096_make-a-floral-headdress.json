Depending on the size of the flowers and bunches they are sold in, you will need 1 to 2 bunches of your main flowers (about 6 to 12 stems). The main flowers set the tone for your headdress and make the biggest statement, so keep in mind what color scheme and vibe you are going for. You can use real or fake flowers depending on the occasion and your personal preference. Choose one main flower for your headdress, or mix it up with 2 or 3 options. Roses, dahlias, daisies, carnations, and peonies are all great options that tend to hold up well on floral headdresses."
