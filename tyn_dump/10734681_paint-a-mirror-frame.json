Look for small screws on the back of the mirror and unscrew these using a screwdriver. Then lift or slide the mirror out of the frame. Only some mirrors have a removable frame. If you cannot see any screws or an obvious way to remove the frame, don't try to force it as you could end up damaging the mirror. There are ways to work around painting the frame if the mirror cannot be removed. If you really want the mirror to be removed but you cannot see how to do so yourself, take the mirror to a glass shop. It can be professionally removed and refitted once you have completed painting."
