Add to the professional look by sticking with traditional colors. For men, consider silver, gunmetal, brown or black frames. For women, consider brown, gold tones, silver, burgundy, black, or espresso frames. Show off your creativity or youthful style with funky designs and visual detail. Consider thicker, larger plastic frames in geometric shapes or frames with laser detail patterns along the side of the frames. Consider a less traditional color, like blue or green, for a fresh, youthful appearance. Also consider multi-colored laminates. Use your eyeglasses to show that you are young at heart, if not in age, by selecting frame shapes that subtly uplift the face. Men should go with upswept rectangles, while women can consider soft cat-eyes. Consider Color Examine your skin tone. Individuals with pink or blue undertones have \u201ccool\u201d toned skin, while individuals with yellow or peach undertones have \u201cwarm\u201d toned skin. Olive skin falls between warm and cool, since it is a mix of both yellow and blue undertones. Consider your eye color. Determining the warmth or coolness of your eye color can get tricky, since the spectrum of possible eye colors covers such a wide range. If you have blue eyes, determine how close they are to pale blue-gray. Most blue eyes are considered cool, but the closer they are to gray, the warmer they get. Another option is to go with a peach or orange color which will make your eye color pop. If you have brown eyes, determine how close they are to black. Most brown eyes are considered warm, but extremely dark browns often qualify as cool toned. If you have green eyes, determine whether your eyes are blue-green or yellow-green. Blue-green shades are cool-toned, while yellow-green shades are warm. Look at your hair color. Cool tones include strawberry blond, platinum, blue-black, white, auburn, salt-and-pepper, and ash brown. Warm tones include golden blond, brownish black, brown-gold, carrot, or dusty gray. Average your three tones together to determine your overall coloring. If you have more warm tones, then you likely have warm coloring. If you have more cold tones, you likely have cool coloring. Search for frame colors that coordinate well with your natural coloring. Think gold, copper, camel, khaki, peach, orange, coral, off-white, fire-engine red, and blond tortoise if you have warm coloring. Lean toward silver, black, rose-brown, blue-gray, plum, magenta, pink, jade, blue, and dark tortoise if you have cool coloring. General Considerations Get an eye exam. Before you invest in a pair of eyeglasses, you must have an accurate prescription for your lenses. Shop at inexpensive stores that either specialize in eyeglasses or that have an eyeglasses section if you need emergency lenses because an old pair broke or got lost.  Consider going to an optometrist or boutique if investing in a quality pair. These options usually cost a little more, but the quality of service and product may be worth the price. If you have a weak prescription but still want glasses, try shopping online for them. Many of the inexpensive eyeglass sellers don't carry glasses weaker than +/- 1.0. If you have a +/- 0.5 prescription and you don't want to pay a high price for your glasses, you'll find many options online. Mind Your Budget Only buy what you need. Lenses come with a number of added features, such as scratch-resistant coatings and color-changing features meant to offer ultraviolet protection. While many of these features do effectively provide what they offer, they are also largely unnecessary. If you have a tight budget, skip the extras and stick with a basic prescription lens. Shy away from brand names if your budget is low and you don't need to get the latest styles.  Look for coupons. If you purchase your eyeglasses from a department store or popular eyeglasses chain store, you may be able to find coupons in magazines or online. Check with your medical insurance. Many carriers cover a portion of the cost for eyeglasses if you buy them at specific places. Depending on your coverage, you could have more or less choice available to you.",
