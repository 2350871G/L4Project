Epoxy fillers, such as auto bondo, are much stronger than wood and body fillers, and are better suited for withstanding the wear and tear that doors endure.

Experts there can help you identify the type of wood that was used and supply you with the necessary materials. Glue the new timber into place. Use wood or carpenter's glue to affix the replacement timber into place. Once fit, allow the glue to dry. Wood or carpenter's' glue sets thin, minimizing gaps between wooden parts. This glue also comes in waterproof varieties, making them ideal for wood-based projects. Hammer two nails into the top and bottom of the new timber for a more secure fit. Sand the repaired area smooth. Use sandpaper to sand away any glue residue or imperfections between the new and old frame. Apply a body or wood filler. Mix enough body filler, also called bondo, to cover the entirety of the repaired areas. Apply and smooth with a putty knife. Allow to dry. The filler will fill in any gaps in the glue and help maintain the repair. Most brands of body and wood filler are similar in the tasks they can handle. The eventual hardness, natural color, and malleability of each filler will differ depending on brand and ingredients. If pricing is a concern, body filler tends to be cheaper than wood filler. Sand the filler. Sand the applied filler smooth with sandpaper. Once smooth, finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint. Repairing Minor Wood Rot Identify the rotted areas. Wood rot often occurs near the bottom of door frames, where water tends to pool during rain or floods. Measure the section of door frame containing wood rot and mark the area with a pencil. Carve out the rotted areas. Using a chisel, dremel, or straight oscillating tool, grind out all of the rotted areas of wood on the frame. It is important to get every last bit of rotted wood you can see. If even a small amount of rotted wood remains, the fungus causing the rot will continue to spread. If the rot covers a particularly large area or extends beyond the door frame into the structure of the house, more serious repairs will be necessary to keep the rot from returning. Inspect your door for wood rot. When the frame becomes rotted, the door can also rot as well. An infected door can pass the rot to the door frame and vice versa. Replace the door if it becomes rotted. Insert a wire mesh into the carved area. Purchase a folded wire mesh and place it in the gap of the frame. Lock it in place with screws. This wire mesh will serve as a skeleton for the body filler. Mix enough wood or body filler to fill the carved out gap. Use a putty knife to fill the mesh cavity with the mixture. Allow to set for a few minutes and add additional filler to fill any gaps. Remove excess filler with a chisel before it hardens. Use an epoxy-based filler for substantial repairs such as filling rotted portions of door frames. Epoxy fillers, such as auto bondo, are much stronger than wood and body fillers, and are better suited for withstanding the wear and tear that doors endure. Plan out how much epoxy filler you'll need. Once mixed, the epoxy filler dries quickly. Invest in a few higher quality tools if sanding or carving epoxy filler \u2013 the filler is often sturdier than the wood itself when dry. Allow to dry overnight. Once dry, sand to smoothness as desired. Finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint. Repairing Minor Frame Damage Identify the damaged areas. Survey the frame for areas that need to be filled. Animal bites, door keys, bed frames and other accidents can cause a variety of light dents and gouges in the door frame. Gently push and pull at any visible nicks, dents or scratches to test the severity of the damage. If pieces of wood pull away, a more complex repair might be necessary. Cover gouges with filler. Smaller nicks, dents and gouges can be filled in with a body or wood filler. Use a putty knife to apply the filler into the gouges. Use wood or body fillers for cosmetic damage such as slight gouges or dents. They lack the structural integrity of harder fillers such as epoxy, but tend to have a more pleasant aesthetic. If you expect the door frame to continue to take a lot of wear and tear, use the epoxy filler to provide extra strength to the repair. The epoxy filler will have a greater resistance to future nicks and scratches than wood or body filler. You can also have sheet metal bent to cover the susceptible area. Alternatively, if the damage is very minor, you can sand out the damaged area rather than applying filler. Dry overnight. Once dry, sand to smoothness as desired. Finish with one coat of primer and two coats of paint. Use a straight edge to help keep the filler level and in place when applying to vertical surfaces.",
