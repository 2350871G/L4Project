Before you continue, check that this yarn tail is dangling behind the utensil, and that it isn\u2019t woven between any other prongs. While you can use a plastic fork for this project, metal forks are a lot more sturdy. Try to use a fork with around 3-4 prongs. Thin, average wool works best for pom poms."

To get a small, 1 in (2.5 cm) sized pom pom, wrap the yarn around the fork about 60 times. Try wind the yarn as tightly as possible to give the pom pom its structure. Mimic the motion of twirling your fork in spaghetti as you do this. While 60 times might seem a bit excessive, these yarn loops allow your finished pom pom to look especially fluffy. If you\u2019d like to make your pom pom even fluffier, try wrapping more yarn around the fork. Did you know? If you\u2019d like to make larger pom poms, try wrapping the yarn around a 2 empty toilet paper rolls instead of a fork. The 2 toilet paper rolls serve the same purpose as the fork prongs, which lets you form a knot around the wound-up yarn."
