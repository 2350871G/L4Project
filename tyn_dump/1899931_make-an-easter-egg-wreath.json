Making a Paper Wreath Cut the inside out of a paper plate to create a ring. Find a paper plate, then poke a hole in the middle. Stick scissors into the hole and cut towards the rim. Cut around the inside edge of the rim to create a ring. Keep the ring and discard the rest. Alternatively, you can cut a ring out of a sheet of cardstock. The paper plate can be any side you want it to be. The actual wreath will be about 4 to 8 in (10 to 20 cm) bigger than the plate, depending on the placement of the eggs.

        "Hot glue moss to the front of a grapevine wreath to create a natural look.",
        "Purchase a bag of moss from the craft store, then hot glue tufts to the front of the wreath.",
        "Leave the back and sides of the wreath bare so that the visible grapevine will give it some texture!",
        "Alternatively, you can cover the wreath with Easter grass.",
        "This will make it look more like an Easter basket.",
        "If you are using a Styrofoam wreath, consider wrapping burlap or satin ribbon around it to hide the foam.",
        "Hot glue the ends of the ribbon down so that it doesn't come off.",
        "Hot glue plastic Easter eggs to the wreath.",
        "Here is where you can get really creative!",
        "If you go to a craft store, you'll find all sorts of plastic Easter eggs, from the traditional brightly-colored ones to ones that are speckled to look like real bird eggs.",
        "You can hot glue as many eggs as you want to your wreath.",
        "If you covered your wreath with moss, leave some of the moss showing between the eggs for a more natural look.",
        "Don\u2019t add anything to the sides.",
        "If you used a Styrofoam wreath, consider using enough eggs to cover the entire wreath, including the sides.",
        "Play around with different egg sizes.",
        "Make them point all in the same direction or in different directions.",
        "You can use real eggs, but you will have to empty and clean them first.",
        "Fill the gaps between the eggs with sprigs of flowers, if desired.",
        "If you left some space between your eggs, you might want to fill them in with small sprigs of silk flowers.",
        "This will look especially nice if you used moss on a grapevine wreath.",
        "Small flowers, such as chamomile, baby\u2019s breath, or lavender will look the nicest.",
        "Alternatively, you can use sprigs of greenery, such as leaves or ferns, instead.",
        "Make a bow out of wired ribbon, then secure it to the wreath, if desired.",
        "It would be best to secure the bow to the wreath with a piece of floral wire.",
        "This way, you can easily pull it off and re-use it.",
        "Alternatively, you can hot glue the bow to the wreath.",
        "Most people like to place their bow at the top or bottom of the wreath, but you can place yours at an angle for a unique look!",
        "Cut the ends of the ribbon into angles or notches, then seal them with a flame to prevent fraying.",
        "Add a ribbon hanging loop, if desired.",
        "The easiest way to hang a wreath is to fit a wreath hanger over your door, then hang the wreath from the large hook.",
        "If you don't want to use one of those, however, cut a 12 to 24 in (30 to 61 cm) piece of ribbon, thread it through the middle of your wreath, then tie the ends together to make a loop.",
        "If you made your wreath from Styrofoam and plastic eggs, you can hang it outside, but other types of materials may not be waterproof and should be hung indoors."
