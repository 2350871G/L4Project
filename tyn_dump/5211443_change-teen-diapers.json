A disposable underpad is just one of many options to provide a barrier between the teen and the changing surface.

Channel the teen\u2019s aggression into the diapering process by asking them to assist with preparing the supplies or the room. You could say, \u201cLook how strong you are, could you use some of your strength to help me do this? It will go much faster.\u201d\nTell the teen that you're only trying to help them and that it's not okay for them to hurt you in the process. You might say, \u201cI understand that you're frustrated, but hitting me is wrong and you need to stop.\u201d\nIf you feel physically in danger, stop the diapering process and try again after a 15-minute cooldown period. Offer positive reinforcement. If a teen usually resists changing, be sure to offer praise if everything goes smoothly. At the end of the change, you might observe, \u201cThank you so much for helping out! Did you notice how quickly that went?\u201d\nOffer an incentive for cooperative behavior in the future. For example, say, \u201cIf we have a week with no arguments over diaper changes, we'll go out to your favorite restaurant.\u201d\nChange it into a positive situation for both you and your teen. Use the time to talk about everything else than the diaper change. Ask for help. You may not be able to complete the changing process on your own, especially if your teen physically resists. If this happens, ask your teen for help and then reach out to others, if necessary. For example, when changing at home you may call-out to other family members. Choose someone your teen trusts, or ask them who they want to help, if possible. This should be a last resort, as it may violate the teen's privacy.",
