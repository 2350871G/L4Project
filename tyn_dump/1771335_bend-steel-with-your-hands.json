(A common strongman feat was bending a 60-penny nail, which is 6 inches [15 cm] long.) The shorter the bar, the harder it is to bend, as shorter lengths give less bending leverage than longer lengths; however, some prefer a six inch (15 cm) bar to a seven inch (17.5 cm) bar because of the way the stock was formed. You can buy steel bars in the optimal length for hand-bending from some online retailers or buy longer bars either online or from your local hardware store and cut off a piece of the desired length. To cut the steel bar, use a pair of bolt cutters, preferably about 24 inches (60 cm) long. Wear safety goggles when cutting, as short pieces can travel at high speed when cut from the larger bar stock. Grind or file off the cut end to smooth it."

        "Keep up the bending pressure from your fulcrum fingers and your driving muscles as you bend the steel further, until your fulcrum fingers start to touch.",
        "If you're bending from the double overhand position, you can go from making the initial bend to continuing the bend in a single motion without changing your hand grip.",
        "If you're bending from the palms down or reverse position, you may have to change to the double overhand position to continue bending the steel.",
        "Ideally, you want to make this part of the bend in a single, smooth motion.",
        "If you're not strong enough to do that, you can make multiple attempts in rapid succession, using as much force as you can muster.",
        "Don't rest too long between attempts, or the steel will cool, making it harder to bend.",
        "Crush the ends of the bar together.",
        "Press the ends of the bar together until you can lace your fingers together; the ends should be about 2 inches (5 cm) apart.",
        "Then, use your clasped hands and upper arms like a nutcracker to finish bending the steel.",
        "You may have to remove some of the wrapping around the steel if it gets in the way.",
        "You may also have to grasp the bent steel in one hand and clasp that hand with your other hand, squeezing both the steel and your hand.",
        "As with the sweep, crush the bar's ends together should follow quickly after making the 90-degree bend so that the steel doesn't have time to cool."
