Standard glass cleaners such as Windex or a foaming glass cleaner such as ZEP will also work well. Finally, some people create their own cleaners by using a water and vinegar mixture or simply rubbing pure ammonia on their windshield. Ammonia is an excellent glass cleaner. However, it can easily damage the paint, upholstery, and carpet in your car. Be careful of drips when using it as a cleaner. To make your own water-vinegar cleaner, mix one part hot water with one part vinegar in a spray bottle. Shake well."
