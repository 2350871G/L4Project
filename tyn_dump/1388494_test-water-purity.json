There are many different reasons why your water could be contaminated, so be as specific as you can in order to get the test you need.

Some tests have special requirements, and if you don\u2019t follow them, you won\u2019t get an accurate result.

It\u2019s a problem if you notice white spots from mineral stains or soap scum. Hard water can also irritate your skin or cause water heaters and clothing to break down more quickly than usual. TDS tests are not perfect. They don\u2019t cover many other water problems, including pollution from pesticides or lead. Call a certified lab for a more complete test. Fill a clean glass with a sample of water. Wash out the glass with soap and water before using it. Fill it about \u00be of the way full so you have plenty of room for the meter. If you\u2019re planning on testing your tap water, simply fill it with water from the faucet. Otherwise, dip the glass into the water to collect a big sample. You need at least \u20442 in (1.3 cm) of water for the test, enough to submerge the tip of the meter. Sterilizing the glass isn\u2019t necessary since you\u2019re not testing for things like bacteria. It won\u2019t affect the test. Submerge the tip of the meter in the water sample. Take the TDS meter out of the box and pull the cover off of it. It\u2019s like a thermometer and has one end that activates when you put it in the water. Turn the meter on and push that end about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) into the water. Keep it there until you see numbers appear on the meter\u2019s screen. Don\u2019t submerge the entire meter or else you might damage it. Check the readout to figure out if your water is at a safe level. The TDS is measured in parts per million (ppi). This number changes a lot depending on where you live and what is going on with your water supply. On average, a ppi of less than 600 is considered to be good. Anything over 900 is considered to be poor, and 1,200 ppi means your water is bad news. If your water has a high TDS rating, treat there are several ways to treat it. The easiest way is to get a reverse osmosis water filter that draws out the solids. Another way is to distill by boiling it and collecting the water vapor. Keep in mind that a low TDS rating doesn\u2019t necessarily mean your water is safe. It means that it has a low amount of solid minerals, which aren\u2019t necessarily harmful to begin with.",
