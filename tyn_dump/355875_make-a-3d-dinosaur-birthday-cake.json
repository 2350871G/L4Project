Assembling the Dinosaur Make a paper template based on this image (click to enlarge). If you have a printer that can print on 11\u201dx17\u201d paper, you can print it large enough for a 9\" cake.

Finishing Touches Spread a thin layer of green frosting over the cake with a spatula. This is called the crumb coat -- and for good reason, as much of the crumbs pull away and get mixed up in the frosting. Use a very light hand on the cut surfaces of cake.
