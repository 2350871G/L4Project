Syncing the songs is more difficult when you\u2019re using older hardware like turntables. You need to monitor the songs as they play.

DJ mixing controllers have buttons for effects like reverb, echo, and filters. Combine the effects with fading controls to keep audiences on their toes. Reverb causes voices to sound louder and richer. It also may cause music to sound industrial, which often works well on techno and house tracks. Use echo to emphasize a beat. While the beat echoes, fade the song out and come back strong with the beat from the new song. It\u2019s a good way to cover up imperfect transitions, too. Effects like filters give music a different tone. Filters are basically EQ controls, which you use to separate frequencies in a track.

        "You need to monitor the songs as they play.",
        "Put your headphones on, listen carefully, then make adjustments by turning the gain knobs on your mixer.",
        "If you\u2019re syncing songs manually, adjust the song that has lower vocals or fewer high notes.",
        "When you slow down a faster song, the pitch changes, and pitch changes stand out more in higher notes.",
        "Open both audio channels by sliding the crossfader to the middle.",
        "Continue playing the first song until you get close to the end of it, then begin setting up your equipment for the new song.",
        "When the crossfader knob is in the middle of its track, it opens up both the left and right audio channels equally.",
        "You will be able to hear the second song as soon as you hit the play button.",
        "Another option is to ignore the crossfader and adjust both audio channels manually.",
        "Look for channel upfader knobs on the sides of the board.",
        "Operate the knob for the song you aren\u2019t currently playing.",
        "Pull it up to open the audio channel.",
        "Start the new song on a beat near the end of the old song.",
        "Wait for a significant section at the end of the first song, such as during an instrumental chorus, to play the second song.",
        "Match the songs beat for beat so they don\u2019t clash.",
        "Keep playing them side by side as the first song heads towards its conclusion.",
        "Listen to both songs through your headphones.",
        "When songs are played out loud, such as at a packed club, you hear a delay.",
        "The sound you hear in your headphones is more accurate, ensuring you line up the beats correctly.",
        "Adjust the volume and equalization controls to play the new song.",
        "Operate the volume control first, bringing the second song up to an audible level matching the first one.",
        "Then, use the equalization (EQ) controls to make fine adjustments to the audio.",
        "EQ enables you to change different frequencies, such as changing the level of bass or treble in a song.",
        "Watch the channel audio meter on your screen.",
        "Make sure it stays \u201cin the yellow\u201d for the most part, or in the middle of the color-coded meter.",
        "When the audio gets too high and goes \u201cinto the red,\u201d the audio distorts.",
        "If you don\u2019t have channel audio meters, watch the master volume meter.",
        "Spend a lot of time with the EQ controls at home while practicing your mixes.",
        "While you have plenty of time to adjust the second audio track, you still need to be careful with them in a live setting so they don\u2019t disrupt the audio quality.",
        "Blend the tracks together with fader controls.",
        "Begin nudging the crossfader bar towards the side responsible for the new track.",
        "If you\u2019re using manual channel controls, move both knobs to about 75%.",
        "Listen to the music to make sure the sound level stays consistent.",
        "Use the master volume meter to monitor the overall sound level of the mix.",
        "If the volume dips too low, you turned down the audio too quickly.",
        "Fade out the old track while maintaining the new track\u2019s overall volume.",
        "Take off your headphones if you\u2019re wearing any and keep an eye on the master volume indicator.",
        "Listen to the beat of the music.",
        "Slowly raise the audio level for the new song.",
        "At the same time, decrease the audio level for the old song to complete the transition.",
        "The perfect transition is seamless.",
        "The beat never stops and listeners keep dancing.",
        "If you are able to hear the fading audio or abrupt song changes, you didn\u2019t time your transition well enough.",
        "Practice with the songs to improve it.",
        "Creating Better Mixes Use lyrics as an opportunity to transition during vocal sections.",
        "Lyrical phrases are like landmarks in songs.",
        "They often serve as a great tool to help you keep track of the song.",
        "Memorize the lyrics at the beginning and end of each song, counting the beats in these sections.",
        "Then, activate the second song to transition away from the first song.",
        "Transitioning between instrumental sections is much easier.",
        "For lyrical sections, you need to find a natural transition spot, like at the end of a chorus.",
        "Load up the new song on the second audio channel, preparing it in advance for the transition.",
        "Remove the bass from fading songs to smooth out transitions.",
        "Booming bass sounds are a problem when songs play at the same time.",
        "The sound volume becomes overwhelming, making the audio sound terrible.",
        "You normally can\u2019t combine them by playing them together, so use the EQ controls on your mixer to cut the bass while fading out the song you need to stop.",
        "A standard DJ controller has 3 EQ knobs controlling low, medium, and high frequencies on each knob.",
        "Pull the low frequency knob down to fade the bass out.",
        "Add effects to transitions to give them personality and variety.",
        "Transitions throughout a long playlist tend to get monotonous, so DJs add special effects.",
        "DJ mixing controllers have buttons for effects like reverb, echo, and filters.",
        "Combine the effects with fading controls to keep audiences on their toes.",
        "Reverb causes voices to sound louder and richer.",
        "It also may cause music to sound industrial, which often works well on techno and house tracks.",
        "Use echo to emphasize a beat.",
        "While the beat echoes, fade the song out and come back strong with the beat from the new song.",
        "It\u2019s a good way to cover up imperfect transitions, too.",
        "Effects like filters give music a different tone.",
        "Filters are basically EQ controls, which you use to separate frequencies in a track.",
        "A filter may isolate high vocals, for instance, and make them more intense.",
        "Make your own remixes for unique songs and transitions.",
        "Remixes involve altering existing songs, such as by editing in sounds, looping segments, or combining different songs.",
        "You need an audio editing program like Audacity or Ableton Live.",
        "Once you make the tracks, add them to your mixing queue and transition between them like you normally would.",
        "Remixes give you an opportunity to customize songs.",
        "For example, mash together smaller segments of different songs, then perform spectacular transitions between them live to keep audiences on their toes.",
        "Use a remix live like any normal song.",
        "Try supplementing a remix with different effects and volume modulations from your mixing controls.",
        "Record mixes and post them online to increase your following.",
        "While you practice going through an entire set list of songs at home, use your audio editing program to record yourself.",
        "Then, upload your unique mix to a site like Mixcloud or Soundcloud.",
        "You get a chance to spread your work without having to go out to the nearest club.",
        "Uploading websites are a great way to hone your mixing skills.",
        "Read feedback from your listeners to see where you need to improve."
