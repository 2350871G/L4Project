Apply some soap and water to your fingers or a washcloth and gently rub it into your belly button to get rid of dirt, grime, and lint. When you\u2019re done, carefully rinse away all the suds.Tip: If your belly button is pierced, you\u2019ll need to take special care to keep it clean. Use a warm saltwater solution to clean the area around the piercing at least 2-3 times a day, or as often as your piercing artist or doctor recommends. Belly button piercings can take a long time to heal, so you may need to keep up this routine for several months or up to a year. In general, the soap or cleanser you use for the rest of your body should work fine for your belly button. Use a gentle, unscented soap or bodywash if scented soaps cause drying or irritation. You can also use saltwater to gently cleanse your belly button. Mix 1 teaspoon (about 6 g) of table salt with 1 cup (240 mL) of warm water and dip a washcloth in the solution. Carefully massage the saltwater into your navel, then rinse it away with plain water. Saltwater can kill germs and loosen dirt, and you may find it less drying and irritating than soap."

If your doctor packed the cyst with gauze, you\u2019ll need to return to have it removed after 2 days. Wash the wound with warm water once a day until it heals (usually within 5 days). If the cyst comes back, you might need to have surgery to remove it completely. For deep cysts, such as urachal cysts, the surgeon will probably make a tiny incision and remove the cyst using delicate instruments, guided by a camera.
