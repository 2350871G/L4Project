You could also use a flat chopping board or a large plate, but you\u2019ll want to make sure that it\u2019s big enough to catch the bits of grated cheese that will be hard to contain. Grasp the fresh brick of Parmesan and slide it up and down the grater. If your grater has multiple-sized holes, use the side with the larger holes that produce an extra-course grate. Use a knife or spoon to scrape any cheese clinging to the grate. If you are using a box-type grater, be sure to scrape the cheese clinging to the inside of the grater as well. The colder your Parmesan, the less likely it will be that the grated cheese will stick to the grater. Transfer the grated cheese to individual serving bowls.  Grating Parmesan Using a Blender Place the brick of cheese on a cutting board.  Cut the Parmesan into 1/2\" (1.27 cm) chunks using a knife.  Toss 3 or 4 chunks into the blender at a time.
