        "Some extractor kits come with a nut that fits over the extractor head.",
        "Grip the nut with two wrenches about 180\u00ba from each other, for a more equal torque.",
        "Heat the screw if it won't come out.",
        "If the screw doesn't budge or you're concerned the extractor might break, remove the extractor.",
        "Heat the screw with a torch, then drip paraffin wax or water on it to lubricate the threads.",
        "Try the extractor again once the screw has cooled.",
        "Take care not to damage the surrounding material.",
        "Even when working with metal, it's best to stick to heat guns or propane torches.",
        "Move the torch around the screw constantly to avoid heating any one spot for more than a second at a time.",
        "Additional Methods Attach a nut to the screw with epoxy.",
        "Find a nut that fits snugly around the screw head.",
        "Bond them together using a two-part metal-to-metal epoxy, often sold as \"weld bond.\"",
        "Wait for the epoxy to cure as directed on the label, then grip the nut with a socket wrench and rotate.",
        "If you don't have a nut the right size, you can adhere a smaller nut to the top of the screw head.",
        "This will not provide as much leverage.",
        "Drill out the screw head.",
        "Breaking the screw usually relieves pressure on the screw shaft, making it easier to pull out \u2014 but if it doesn't work, you've eliminated most other options.",
        "Choose a drill bit slightly larger than the shaft of the screw, so the head detaches completely when you drill through.",
        "Start with a center punch to make a hole in the exact center of the screw, and take care to drill directly through the center.",
        "Once the screw head breaks off, grip the screw shaft with locking pliers and rotate counter-clockwise to remove.",
        "If the screw head isn't flat, file it down or grind it with a dremel and a pointed grinding stone attachment.",
        "Center punch and drill once you have a flat surface to work with.",
        "Hire a professional.",
        "If all else fails, hire a machine shop to remove the screw using electrical discharge machining (EDM).",
        "This may be your best option if you used a screw extractor that broke off inside the screw."
