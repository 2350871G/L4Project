Plan situations or lines in your funny video that lead the viewer to one conclusion only to flip that conclusion on its head. You could, for example, write about a character who realizes on their blind date that they used to be swim team rivals.

Try writing a scene where two similar ideas or situations are presented, then add a third that breaks the pattern. You could, for example, write a slapstick scene where two characters walk through a doorway normally and the third gets hit in the face with a pie when he walks through. Or you could write about two ghosts who like living in a haunted house and a third who is afraid of other ghosts."

Think about who your video's target audience is and write in situations that this group has probably experienced. For example, you could write a video about funny, relatable things that happen to high school students (like boring teachers, awkward first dates, and overly-enthusiastic football games). Try writing about situations that are funny to you or a community you belong to, as this will help your humor feel more authentic."

You could, for example, write about a mean, strict boss and have another character say, \"Did Tiny Tim get on your nerves today, Mr. Scrooge?\" Or you could write about a person who just got turned down by a guy and have them say, \"I just hit on him but now I feel like my heart was hit by a bus.\""
