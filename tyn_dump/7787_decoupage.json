        "If you're decoupaging a large piece of furniture, avoid coating the whole thing in the glue before placing some of the material on it.",
        "Some of the glue will dry before you have a chance to apply the material.",
        "Continue to decoupage until you've used all of your material.",
        "You don't have to wait for the material to dry before you spread more glue and put more material on the furniture.",
        "Let the furniture dry for at least a 2 to 4 hours.",
        "Once you've finished decoupaging the furniture, leave it to dry in a well-ventilated space.",
        "The furniture should be dry to the touch before you apply a varnish.",
        "Follow the manufacturer's instructions about drying time since they'll vary by product.",
        "Seal the furniture with another coat of glue.",
        "Spread a thin layer of glue or varnish over the entire piece of furniture.",
        "This will keep the materials in place and protect the furniture from wear.",
        "If you'd like more protection, let the first coat dry and apply another coat of glue or varnish.",
        "Making Decoupaged Terra Cotta Pots Paint and seal the terra cotta pots.",
        "Get out as many clean terra cotta pots as you want to decoupage and wipe them clean.",
        "If you want to paint the pots so they're colorful, paint them with acrylic paint and let them dry completely.",
        "Then coat the inside of the pot with a sealer such as an acrylic or water-based polyurethane sealer.",
        "If you don't want to paint the outside of the pot, you'll need to apply a sealer to protect the pot from water damage.",
        "Cut the material you want to apply.",
        "Take your paper or fabric and cut out the design, image, or shape as you want it to appear on the pot.",
        "For example, if you're covering the pot with photos of roses, cut the outline of the roses with the stems and leaves.",
        "For an improvised look, you could tear the material instead of cutting it.",
        "You can also cut out interesting shapes to make an abstract design on the pot.",
        "Use a brush to coat the bottom of the material with glue.",
        "Dip a paint brush or small foam brush into the glue.",
        "Spread a thin layer of it on the back of your cut or torn material.",
        "If you'd like a large, bold image on your pot, just decoupage 1 image.",
        "For a fun pattern, stick smaller torn or cut images onto the sides of the pot.",
        "Press the material onto your pot.",
        "Set the material on the pot and smooth it out with your fingers so there are no bumps or wrinkles.",
        "If you put too much glue on the back of the material, it may leak out of the sides.",
        "Use a cotton swab to wipe away the excess so you don't have bumps on your pot.",
        "Continue to apply the rest of your materials to the pot.",
        "You don't need to wait for the material to dry if you'd like to overlap other pieces over the material.",
        "Cover the pot with a layer of glue.",
        "Dip a foam brush into glue and spread it evenly across the entire outside of the pot.",
        "Apply a thin layer so it dries quickly and clear.",
        "Let the pot dry completely.",
        "If you'd like an extra layer of protection, brush on another layer 15 minutes after the base layer has dried.",
        "You may only need to apply 1 layer if the decoupage items you've decoupaged thin materials or the pot won't be placed outside."
