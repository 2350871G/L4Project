What makes a video YouTube Poop isn't the videos that are used in the video, but the way they are edited. Sometimes YouTube Poop intends to tell a joke or a story, or make fun of the source material. Other times, it may be completely random and nonsensical. To get an idea of what YouTube poop is, search YouTube Poop on YouTube and check out some of the most recent YouTube Poop videos."

            "headline": "Know the different types of Poopism.",
            "description": "Poopism refers to the way these videos are edited. They may contain random chopping, extremely loud audio manipulation, sentence mixing/word splicing, visual jokes, colorful and eye-popping visual effects, and other things all put together to make a video interesting, funny, confusing, or even intentionally annoying. The following are some of the different types of Poopism:\n\nStutter Loop:  This form of editing takes a short clip of a video and repeats it over and over again. The purpose is to either place emphases on a phrase or clip or take it out of context and imply something unintended. Sometimes audio or visual effects may be applied to each instance the clip repeats. Sometimes the visuals may be removed or replaced with a different visual, such as a character reaction. Sequence mixing:  This form of editing involves taking random words from a character and places them in a different order to create a new (often profane) sentences. Panning and Zooming:  This involves taking a video clip and making it move across the screen or zoom in extra close. Freeze Frame:  This is a form of editing in which a single frame of video is paused and held for an extended period of time. The purpose is usually to emphasize a character's expression. Random Visual Effects: Random visual effects are often added to YouTube Poop videos to change the color of a visual and distort the image. Popular effects include swirl, wave, spherize, flashing lights and colors, and chroma key with overlapping video. Random Sound Effects:  In addition to random visual effects, random sound effects are also used in YouTube Poop. These can be external sound effects like cartoon sound effects, alarms, buzzes, and censor bleeps. Sometimes audio effects are applied to the audio of a video clip. Popular audio effects include pitch shifting the audio to make it higher or lower, or distorting the audio in a way that is loud, obnoxious, or annoying to listen to. Tech Text: This is on-screen text that is inserted into a video by the creator. It often only appears for a split second. It may contain a joke, commentary, or random nonsense. Voice Transplant:  This is a form of editing that replaces the voice of one character with the voice of another character. Lip Syncing:  This is a form of editing in which the visuals of a video are edited to match a different set of audio, such as making it appear as though a character is singing. YouTube Poop Movies:  This a genre of YouTube Poop that tends to be longer. They may have a storyline or a strong sense of continuity. Most notably \"The King Gets A Car\" and \"Morshu Gets A Car.\" YouTube Poop Music Videos:  These videos are more commonly known as YTPMV's. They use the same video clips and editing techniques that are common in other YouTube Poop videos, but the visuals and audios are edited so they fit a song. The music can be a song from a video game, a popular song, or an original composition."
