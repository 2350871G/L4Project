Any brown tie and dress shoes will suffice for your representation, though if you're striving for perfection, consider looking through pictures from the movie or watching the movie with a watchful eye for wardrobe. If you're going as Mark Hamill's Joker, wear white spats over your shoes. If you're going as the Joker from The LEGO Batman Movie, wear an orange shirt under the jacket.
