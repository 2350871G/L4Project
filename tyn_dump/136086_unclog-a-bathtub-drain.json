        "Now, turn on the bathtub to see if it is now draining normally.",
        "Pour \u00bc cup of baking soda and 1 cup white vinegar into the drain.",
        "If pouring hot water into the drain did not unclog it, use baking soda and vinegar to remove excessive gunk.",
        "Wait 15-20 minutes.",
        "Allow the baking soda and vinegar to sit for 15-20 minutes.",
        "You can use a timer to keep track of the time.",
        "Boil more water in the kettle.",
        "Once again, fill the kettle up with water and bring it to a boil.",
        "Pour hot water directly down the drain.",
        "The water will react with the baking soda and vinegar to unclog the drain.",
        "Test the bathtub to see if this method unclogged your drain, and try another method if this one did not work.",
        "Using baking soda and vinegar does not use any chemicals and generally works for small clogs, so this may not work every time.",

        "Scrub the strainer and stopper to remove any hair and soap scum.",
        "Fill the bathtub with a few inches of water.",
        "You want to fill the tub with just enough water to submerge the plunger; water is how the plunger gets suction.",
        "Use the plunger to suction out any obstructions in the drain.",
        "Place the bowl of the plunger over the drain, and press and pull it rapidly.",
        "You will have to use some force here, and be careful\u2014you may get splashed.",
        "Most likely, dirty water and gunk will rush out of the drain while you are plunging it.",
        "After about 10 plunges, check to see if there is dirty water and gunk coming out of the drain.",
        "Consider adding more force if nothing is coming out of the drain.",
        "Keep plunging until the water drains when you remove the plunger.",
        "If no obstructions are coming out of the drain, you may need to use a different method.",
