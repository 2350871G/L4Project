This means you do not need to worry if the blur stick will match your skin tone. However, you should make sure the blur stick will work with your skin type. Blur sticks are often good for people who have oily or combination skin, as they reduce shine and minimize your pores. Blur sticks keep your skin looking supple and dewy, without clogging your pores. You may want to exfoliate your skin first to make applying the blur stick easier. If you have dry skin, blur sticks can also be beneficial as they can help to moisturize any dry patches and prep your skin for other makeup."
