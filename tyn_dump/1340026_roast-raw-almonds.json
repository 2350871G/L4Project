If you want to coat the nuts in olive oil and other seasonings, toss them in your choice of oil and spices directly on the baking sheet or beforehand in a separate mixing bowl. Topping Options for Roasted Almonds\nSweet: Sugar, cinnamon sugar, honey, cocoa powder\nSavory: Sea salt, garlic powder, seasoned salt, rosemary, barbecue sauce\nSpicy: Chili powder, hot sauce, buffalo sauce, sriracha, black pepper"
