Butter adds richness, and shortening and other types of oil tend to create a lighter flavor. Use the fat recommended in the recipe you're using, or if it's not specified, consider these options:\nUse bacon or pork drippings to make a roux you'll be using for gumbo or another dish that will have smoky elements like sausage. Use butter to make a roux you'll be using for a creamy soup, such as a chowder. This is also a good choice if you're making a roux for macaroni and cheese. Shortening makes a good roux base for lighter gratin dishes, since it doesn't have an overwhelming flavor."
