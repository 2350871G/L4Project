Reposition the needle in the needle holder. Use the forceps to hold the needle and then correctly reposition the needle in the needle holder. Use the forceps the evert the left skin edge. Grasp the part of the left skin edge that is straight across the wound from where you first inserted the needle on the right side. Push the needle through the left skin edge. Place the tip of the needle perpendicular to the inside of the wound.

Create a 5 cm short end on the right side of the wound by gently pulling the suture thread through the wound. The suture thread pulled through is the long end of the suture thread which is now on the left side. Put the needle down and out of the way. The needle will not be used for the remainder of the procedure. Place needle holder parallel to the wound in the middle of the two strands. Do not make contact with the wound. Loop the long strand around the needle holder twice (clockwise). Lift the part of the long strand, that is closer to the wound, up and over the instrument. Loop the thread twice around the needle holder. Grab the short side of the thread using the needle holder. Grab the short side of the thread as close to the end as possible. More than one degree of tightness may be necessary, so that the suture material doesn't slip out of the jaws of the needle holder. Pull the short thread through the loops. When pulling the thread, cross your left hand over your right and pull so that the edges of the wound touch. Release the short end of the suture thread.
