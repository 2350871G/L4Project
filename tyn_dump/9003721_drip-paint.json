How many colors you use is up to you. The colors you choose also depend on your artistic vision. Some colors commonly go well together.

Slowly pour in water. Mix the paint and add water until it reaches the consistency you desire. More water will thin the color and cause the paint to drip faster. More expensive acrylic paints are paste-like. Mix them with an equal amount of water and a medium such as Golden Clear Tar Gel or Liquitex Pouring Medium. Alternatively, opt for fluid acrylics or add a drop or two of paint thinner. Fluid acrylics pour well enough on their own, but you may thin them out further by mixing them with water."
