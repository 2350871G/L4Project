The top of the tank should be escape-proof since camel spiders can climb up the side of the tank. They can also chew through plastic mesh, so the lid material needs to be strong. For example, choose a metal mesh lid with small gaps that the camel spider can't squeeze through. Look for aquariums that are used to house tarantulas or scorpions since camel spiders will thrive in a similar habitat."
