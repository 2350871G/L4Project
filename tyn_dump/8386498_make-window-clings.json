        "Press the smooth side (the one that was against your template) against a clean window.",
        "For a sun catcher-like effect, place it in a bright, sunny window.",
        "Using Gelatin Pour 4 cups (950 milliliters) of boiling water into a bowl.",
        "Fill a pot with water and bring it to a boil.",
        "Measure out 4 cups (950 milliliters) and pour it into a bowl.",
        "If you wish to make a smaller batch of window clings, use 2 cups (475 milliliters) instead.",
        "Fill your pot with more water than you need.",
        "The water will evaporate as it cooks.",
        "Stir in 6 packets of gelatin into the water.",
        "Add the gelatin into the water first, then stir it with a whisk until it is completely dissolved.",
        "Make sure that you are using the clear, unflavored kind.",
        "You will be adding color later.",
        "If you wish to make a smaller batch of window clings, use 3 packets instead.",
        "Remove any bubbles with a spoon.",
        "Transfer the gelatin to a rimmed baking sheet.",
        "You want it to be about \u00bc-inch 0.64-centimeter) thick.",
        "If you can't find a baking sheet, you can also use a casserole dish or pie pans.",
        "The goal is to get a thin layer of gelatin that is about \u00bc-inch 0.64-centimeter) thick.",
        "Allow the mixture to cool for 10 to 15 minutes.",
        "Take this time to prepare the rest of your supplies: food coloring, glitter, cookie cutters, etc.",
        "Stir in few drops of food coloring into the gelatin.",
        "You can do this with a skewer or a toothpick.",
        "You can also use liquid watercolor, but food coloring will be safer for younger children who are still teething.",
        "Stir in some glitter, if desired.",
        "If your child is still on the teething stage, consider using edible glitter instead.",
        "Work quickly, however; the gelatin will harden up after 30 minutes.",
        "Allow the gelatin to set overnight.",
        "If your window clings are too soft or wet, they won't stick well to the windows.",
        "Let the gelatin dry for another night.",
        "Cut shapes out using cookie cutters.",
        "Use 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) cookie cutters for this.",
        "If the shapes are too big, they will be to heavy and slide down your window.",
        "Remove the window clings from the pan.",
        "Lift away the excess gelatin from around the shapes first.",
        "Next, slide a spatula under each shape, then use it to lift them out.",
        "Set the shapes down onto a smooth surface, such as a plate, baking sheet, parchment paper, wax paper, etc.",
        "Use the window clings.",
        "Keep in mind that these window clings are delicate and easily torn.",
        "They also do not last a long time.",
        "If they aren't sticking to your window, they are too wet and heavy.",
        "Let them sit, uncovered, for another day or two, before trying again.",
        "These window clings are safe for teething children because they are made from gelatin.",
        "It is not recommended that you munch on them, however; they likely don't taste very good."
