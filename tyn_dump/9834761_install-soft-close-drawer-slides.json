If you do not have a slide available, you can measure the drawer or cabinet from front to back. The standard slide length is 14 in (36 cm). However, deeper cabinets will have longer slides. Fitting the Slides on the Drawer Align the smaller slide against the bottom of the drawer. Lay the drawer on its side. The slide needs to be flush against the drawer\u2019s bottom edge. The slide\u2019s thicker, squared end should be flush with the drawer\u2019s front edge. Undermount slides attach to the bottom of the drawer, one each on the left and right edges.

Draw directly on the drawer. Create a thick, dark line right above both ends of the slide. Also mark the spots where the slide will be screwed to the drawer. The slide will have a screw hole at both ends. Predrill holes into the drawer. Get an electric drill with a drill bit  approximately \u20443 in (1.7 cm) wide. Drill about \u20442 in (1.3 cm) into the screw spots you marked earlier. Drilling the holes in advance prevents damage to the cabinet when you add the screws later. Screw the slide to the drawer. Set the slide back on the drawer. Align its top edge with the mark you made earlier, adjusting the slide so the holes are over the spots you drilled. Place a \u20442 in (1.3 cm) screw in each hole. Fasten the slide in place with an electric screwdriver. To avoid damaging the wood, tighten the screws gradually. Stop when the slide feels firmly in place and doesn\u2019t wobble. Attach the slide on the other side of the drawer. Find the other small slide piece. Flip the drawer over so the other side is facing up. Then, line up and attach the other slide the same way you did with the first one. Setting up the Slide Tracks Set the back brackets in the slide frame. Find the L-shaped metal brackets as well as the 2 remaining slide pieces. Fit a bracket into 1 end on each slide. The brackets easily slide into the frame track. The free ends of the brackets will attach to the cabinets with screws. To make sure the bracket is placed correctly, test the frame pieces by fitting them inside the cabinet. Align the slide frames with the bottom of the cabinet. Place the slide frame pieces inside the cabinet. Push the brackets all the way to the back. The frame pieces should be flush with the bottom edge of the cabinet and rest against the side walls. If you are using undermount or center mount slides, place the frame pieces on the cabinet\u2019s bottom. Use a level to straighten the frames. The frames need to be level from front to back. To check this, set a carpenter\u2019s level on top of the frame. Reposition each frame as needed until the leveling tool is even from left to right.

Use an electric screwdriver to secure the frame to the cabinet. Then, set another screw in the front end of the bracket to secure the slide in place.
