Choose fresh poblano peppers that are unblemished and a dark green color with long enough stems to tie. Tie the stems of the peppers on a piece of twine. The peppers can be close together and you can make the strand any length you choose. Hang the pepper strand in a dry area with good air circulation. Wait several weeks until the peppers have become smooth, dry and dark red."
