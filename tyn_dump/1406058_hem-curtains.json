This means that you will need to cut your curtains longer than you want them to be. The longer the curtain is, the wider the hem needs to be; this will help make it look more proportionate. Standard curtains have a 3 to 4 inch (7.62 10.16 centimeters) wide hem. You'll need to cut your curtains 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) longer than you want them to be. Shorter curtains might look better with a 2 inch (5.08 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) longer than you want them to be. Longer curtains, such as floor to ceiling, might look better with a 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) longer than you want them to be."

Longer curtains, such as floor to ceiling, might look better with a 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) longer than you want them to be. Spread the curtain, wrong-side-up on a flat surface. Because of their size, it might be easier to spread your curtains on the floor. If you have a very large table and a small curtain, however, you can work on the table. Fold your bottom up and press it flat with an iron. How far you fold it up depends on how wide you want your hem to be. For example, if you want a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) wide hem, fold the bottom up by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters).
