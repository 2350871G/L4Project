While many handcrafted items require years of skill, some crafts are relatively easy to learn. Choose a niche in the creative industry that\u2019s easy to learn and inexpensive to pursue.For instance, knitting and crocheting don\u2019t require a lot of money to pursue, and they aren\u2019t overly difficult to learn. Fine carpentry, sewing, and 3D-printing, however, are not easy skills to pick up in a short amount of time. If you\u2019re already skilled in an art or craft, try using that talent in your Etsy shop!"

A name like \u201cTamara\u2019s Tremendous Toys\u201d is a lot more engaging to your customer base. Try writing down any idea that comes into your head, even if it\u2019s mundane.

Try photographing your products in a well-lit area without any clutter in the background. Additionally, choose a simple backdrop that doesn\u2019t distract from the products that you\u2019re trying to sell. Make sure that the details and purpose of your item are evident in the listing picture.For example, if you\u2019re selling handmade earrings, you\u2019d want to include a zoomed-in shot of the jewelry, as well as a picture of someone modeling the item. If you\u2019re selling rugs or blankets, you might want to upload a picture of the blanket lying on a bed and a close-up of the details and pattern. Use caution when shooting near reflective surfaces. Depending on your camera angle, your reflection might faintly show up in the pictures. Try to take your photographs in identical areas. If your product pictures look too different, it might make your shop look disorganized. If you choose to use the camera flash, try to angle your camera lens to prevent any excess flare in your photos."

Additionally, try to price your goods based on the hours of labor that you put into making them.If you run a knitted hat shop, take a mental inventory of how much the yarn will cost. Next, factor in how long it takes you to make each hat. If the yarn costs around $5 and it takes you 2-3 hours to make a hat, it would be fair to price each hat at a minimum of $25. Set an hourly wage for yourself that feels comfortable and fair when compared to other Etsy shops. For instance, don\u2019t set a $25 hourly wage for yourself when other people are setting an hourly wage of $15 or $20.Tip: Try to mold your prices around this formula: Materials + Labor + Expenses + Profit = Wholesale x 2 = Retail"
