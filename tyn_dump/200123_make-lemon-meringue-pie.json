You can do this using a pastry blender or two crisscrossing knives. Keep cutting the mixture resembles small peas. Toss the flour mixture with water. Sprinkle the water into the flour 1 tablespoon at a time. Keep tossing the mixture with a fork until it is moistened and starts to leave the sides of the bowl. Roll the pastry into a ball and flatten it into a thick disk. Work on top of a floured surface to prevent sticking, and do not overwork the pastry. Wrap the thick disk plastic wrap and refrigerate it for 30 to 45 minutes. The dough is ready when it is firm, cold, but pliable. This will give you a nice, flaky crust. Roll the dough out into a 13-inch (33.02 centimeters) disk. Work on top of a lightly-floured surface. If needed, lightly dust your rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Place the dough into a 9-inch (22.86 centimeters) pie pan. Poke the bottom of the crust a few times with a fork, and finish the edges. You can do this by rolling the edges slightly, and pinching them to create a fluted design. Bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes or until it turns a light, golden brown. Take it out of the oven, and set it aside to cool. Making the Pie Filling Reduce the oven's heat to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).  Whisk together the sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt in a medium-sized saucepan, then slowly add the water. Keep whisking until the flour and cornstarch are dissolved. Don't turn on the stove just yet. Cook the mixture over medium-high heat until it comes to a boil. Keep whisking it through so that it doesn't scorch. Beat the egg yolks together in a bowl, then add \u00bd cup (120 milliliters) of the hot mixture to the yolks. Add the mixture slowly, beating it in with a whisk. Save the egg whites to make the meringue topping. Add the egg yolk mixture to the saucepan, return it to a boil, and cook until it thickens. Continue whisking the mixture. It will take about 1 minute for it to thicken. Remove the saucepan from heat and add the butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Keep stirring until butter is melted. For extra flavor, add \u00bd teaspoon of vanilla extract. Pour the mixture into the pie shell and set it aside. Don't store it in the fridge; you want the filling to be still warm when you spoon the meringue on top. Making the Meringue Topping Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until they turn foamy. You can do this in a glass bowl with a handheld mixer, or in a food processor fitted with whisk beaters. Add the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time, and continue beating. As you continue to beat, the egg whites will fluff up and turn white. For extra flavor, add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. Continue beating until the mixture stands in stiff peaks, about 1 to 2 minutes. If you are using a food processor, you may not see any stiff peaks. The mixture while be thick, however, sort of like jello. Spoon meringue the pie filling while the filling is still hot. Remove the plastic wrap first, then spoon the meringue onto the filling. Make sure that it covers the entire surface, from edge to edge. If you'd like, gently tap the surface with the back of a wooden spoon to make the \"peaks.\" Bake the pie for about 10 minutes or until the topping is golden. If you added peaks to your meringue, the grooves will still be white, but the ridges will be golden brown. Remove the pie from the oven, and let it cool for 2 hours before serving. Store any leftover pie in the fridge. Finished. ",
