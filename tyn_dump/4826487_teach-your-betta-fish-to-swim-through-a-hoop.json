If you tap too hard, your betta fish will be startled and won't want to come. If you tap too softly, it won't recognize that you want its attention. A good way to get a gentle tap with the pad of your finger is to simply let your finger fall onto the glass from about 1 in (2.5 cm) away.

This makes the fish associate the reward with following your finger and will make repeated training sessions much easier. Don't put your finger in the water to feed it or you could disturb or upset your fish and have to start training all over again."
