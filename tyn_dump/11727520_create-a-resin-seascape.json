A good suggestion is to use wood for the best outcome, but one can also use glass. Find a space for you to work in. Gather your materials. See Things You'll Need below for reference. Creating a Border and Mixing Colors Lay the tarp on the ground and place the piece on top. Make sure the surface is clean of any dirt or dust.

Place the yellow resin towards the edge of one side of your canvas or wooden table. Using your hand, spread out the color on the side you want it to be. Place the light blue resin you have above the yellow (not on top but in front of empty space).
