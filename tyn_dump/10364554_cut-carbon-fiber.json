If you don\u2019t have a downdraft table, cut the carbon fiber on any sort of flat surface. Use a clamp or vise to pin the piece of carbon fiber in place. To protect the work surface from damage, lay a piece of foam down and cut the carbon fiber on top of it. You may be able to cut carbon fiber without using a clamp. Bracing the carbon fiber with your hand, a straight edge, or another surface can help you cut it cleanly. Whatever you use, make sure the carbon fiber piece cannot slip out of place while you make the cut."

Any wheel or drum designed to cut metal will work.

You can use jigsaws, saber saws, and even hand saws in conjunction with a tungsten-carbide grit-style blade. Electric saws may cut even faster than rotary tools, but the back and forth motion used will cause the edges of the carbon fiber to chip more. Hand saws, such as hacksaws and coping saws, tend to wear out quickly when used on carbon fiber. In addition, you may need to drill through the carbon fiber first to start an interior cut.
