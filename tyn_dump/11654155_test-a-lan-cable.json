While cable testers are similar, different products may have different instructions. The cable tester may have both an insertion and receiver jack on one piece, meaning you don\u2019t need a two-piece tester. Some other testers have both options, so you can run the cable into other rooms if you want to. Make sure there is a battery in the tester before you use it. Most take a 9V battery."
