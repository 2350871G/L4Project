You can get a disposable mask with a particulate filter or a full spray paint respirator with replaceable cartridges on the side. Fit the mask over your mouth, then open up any nearby doors and windows to help ventilate paint fumes. Also, have a pair of rubber gloves on hand to use when cleaning the pipes. If you are able to, paint the pipes before using them in a project. That way, they are easier to work with and can be painted outdoors. Keep other people and pets out of the area until you\u2019re done painting."

Scrub in a circular motion with a light but firm amount of pressure. PVC is soft, so be gentle with it, but apply a little more force to remove rust and other debris from metal. Treat PVC pipes by hand. Electric sanders are too strong and will wear out PVC but can be used on metal pipes. PVC pipes will leave wax on the sandpaper over time, making it unusable. Have multiple pieces of sandpaper on hand and switch sheets when this happens. If metal pipes have rusted badly, remove as much of the rust as possible. Then, apply a rust converter primer to create a stable base for the paint. If the pipes have already been installed, use a sanding block for an easier time rubbing down tough to reach spots."

To clear stubborn debris on PVC, use acetone. Wear gloves and a mask while handling it. You could also use an ammonia-based cleaner such as a glass cleaner. If you\u2019re struggling to remove rust, spread a rust remover onto the pipe with a clean sponge or brush.

Otherwise, use a metal spray paint to begin covering the pipe from top to bottom. If you are able to, work all the way around it before spreading paint to lower sections. Otherwise, paint the pipe one side at a time. Apply the paint consistently to avoid drips. If you notice drips, use less paint to compensate. Avoid overlapping any spots you have already painted. Allow the paint to dry for at least 6 hours. The drying time can vary a lot depending on the product you\u2019re using. Some of them even take as long as 24 hours to surface dry, so check the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for specifics. Wait for the paint to become dry to the touch before recoating the pipe. The paint has to dry, but it doesn\u2019t have to fully cure. Metal paints tend to take a while to cure, so leave that until you\u2019re completely finished painting. Repaint the pipe as needed, letting each layer dry in between. Expect the pipe to need at least one additional coat of paint for a quality finish. Add more paint sparingly to keep the second layer thin and identical to the first one. After it dries, check the quality. You can add multiple layers to even out the finish. Take care not to accidentally overlap any finished areas. For each layer, go over the pipe once. If you go over an area multiple times, the finish won\u2019t be even. After you\u2019re finished, give the pipe at least a day to finish drying before attempting to use it in a project. If it has already been installed, you don\u2019t need to worry about it drying before you use it.",

        "You can buy plastic paint online or at most hardware stores.",
        "You won\u2019t need to get a plastic paint primer, but you could use an acrylic or latex stain-blocking primer if you wish.",
        "PVC is designed to resist moisture, so standard paint doesn\u2019t stick to it.",
        "Sweep the paint canister from side to side to begin spraying the pipe.",

        "Wait 20 to 30 minutes for the paint to dry.",
        "Leave the pipe alone, making sure nothing touches the wet paint in the meantime.",
        "The paint dries relatively quickly in ideal conditions.",

        "The paint won\u2019t be fully cured at this point, so keep the pipe away from moisture and other possible sources of damage.",
        "Be sure to consult the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for a more specific recommendation on how long to let the paint dry.",
        "It can vary a little depending on the brand you buy.",
        "Add extra layers of paint, letting each one dry between coats.",
        "Your pipe probably won\u2019t look consistent and colorful right away.",

        "Existing pipes are safe to use as long as you avoid damage to the finish.",
        "Covering Metal Pipes with Paint Check the color and weight of the pipe to find out what it is made of.",
        "Metal pipes are usually either copper or galvanized steel, although they can be made with other types of metal.",
        "Each metal has some specific traits you can spot by close inspection.",
        "Note the pipe\u2019s color, then touch it, picking it up if it isn\u2019t already installed.",
        "Look for discolorations or other identifying markers.",
        "Use this information to choose a compatible paint or primer.",
        "Copper pipes are often used in plumbing.",
        "They have an orange color similar to a penny and can turn green over time.",
        "Galvanized steel is also used in plumbing.",
        "Steel pipes feel somewhat heavy and are a dull gray color.",
        "Iron is similar and can be painted the same way.",
        "Aluminum pipes look similar to steel ones but have a much shinier, silvery color.",
        "If you pick up an aluminum pipe, it feels very light.",
        "Lead pipes feel very heavy compared to steel.",
        "They tend to be a dark gray color and are easy to scratch.",
        "Lead isn\u2019t magnetic, which you can test with a kitchen magnet.",
        "Select an enamel or oil-based metal paint and primer.",
        "Metal pipes require a specific type of paint that seals it against rust.",
        "To get the paint to stick to the metal, you also have to apply a compatible primer.",
        "Make sure both products are compatible with the type of pipe you\u2019re painting.",
        "Generally, metal paint and primer comes in both spray-on and paint-on varieties that work on almost any type of metal surface.",
        "Oil-based paints and primers are more resistant to stains and damage.",
        "Enamel and acrylic products are both oil-based, so they still work well with metal.",
        "Enamel self-etching primers work very well on aluminum or any bare surfaces.",
        "It\u2019s good for smoothing out rough surfaces for a very consistent finish.",
        "If you\u2019re painting over rust you cannot remove, make sure you\u2019re using a rust converter primer or else the paint won\u2019t stick.",
        "Look for a primer that is labeled as a rust converter.",
        "Spray-on products are useful for covering tight spaces.",
        "If you don\u2019t have to deal with hard-to-reach spots, use a paint-on version for a quicker and more consistent finish.",
        "Apply a metal primer from top to bottom on the pipe.",
        "The easiest way to apply primer is with a microfiber foam roller with \u20448 in (0.95 cm) nap.",
        "You could also use a 2 in (5.1 cm) stiff-bristled paint brush like you would on other surfaces.",
        "Pour the paint into a roller tray and add it gradually so it doesn\u2019t drip.",
        "Then, cover the entire pipe in a consistent layer of paint from top to bottom.",
        "If you\u2019re able to, work on pipes that haven\u2019t been installed yet.",
        "Stand them up on a post or another object that allows you to reach both sides.",
        "Otherwise, paint the sides one at a time.",
        "For pre-installed pipes, spread a liquid primer and paint with a brush to cover tight areas.",
        "Work slowly to avoid getting the paint on nearby walls.",
        "If you\u2019re able to, remove the pipe so you can see what you\u2019re doing.",
        "If you\u2019re using a spray-on primer, hold the canister about 6 in (15 cm) away from the pipe.",
        "Sweep it from side to side while gradually moving down, taking care not to overlap the primer.",
        "If you\u2019re only able to paint one side of the pipe right away, paint it and let it dry.",
        "Once it is dry, you can flip it over and get the other side.",
        "Wait about 24 hours for the primer to dry.",
        "Oil-based products dry at a relatively slow rate, so you\u2019re going to have to deal with a bit of a wait.",
        "In the meantime, keep the pipe safe from moisture or anything else that could damage the finish.",
        "If you\u2019re able to, place it in an area with plenty of air circulation.",
