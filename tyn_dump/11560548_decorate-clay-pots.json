        "Pick colors based on the design scheme for your pot.",
        "For instance, if you\u2019re painting a night sky on your container, use a dark navy or black paint.",
        "Metallics and bold colors are great color options for a clay pot.",
        "Thin the paint by adding a few drops of water.",
        "Add 3-4 drops of water to your acrylic paint.",
        "Stir the water into the paint with a foam brush until the product looks thin and slightly watery.",
        "Don\u2019t add too much water to the mixture, as this could make the paint difficult to apply later on.",
        "If you\u2019re thinning a small amount of paint, only use 1-2 drops of water.",
        "Brush a base layer of paint onto the pot with a brush.",
        "Dip a foam or regular brush into 1 of your acrylic paints, then start applying the product to your pot.",

        "Additionally, paint the inner rim of the pot with paint, as this portion will be visible to the naked eye.",
        "If you\u2019re going for a smooth, consistent layer of paint, try keeping your paint strokes as long and smooth as possible.",
        "If you\u2019re creating a more abstract theme, try painting in small and short strokes.",
        "For instance, if you\u2019re painting a night sky onto your pot, you\u2019ll want to keep the base layer of blue as consistent and smooth as possible.",
        "Let the paint dry completely.",
        "Read the label on your acrylic paint to see what the estimated drying time is.",
        "Wait 1 hour before checking the surface of the pot, and let the container dry for longer, if needed.",

        "Add extra layers of paint to create a vibrant color.",
        "Check the shade of your pot after the base coat dries.",
        "Is this color vibrant enough for your tastes, or would you prefer a deeper hue?",
        "Apply an additional coat or 2 of paint as needed until your container reaches the perfect color.",
        "Let each coat of paint dry before adding a new one.",

        "Apply 2 layers of differently colored paint to create a unique pattern.",
        "After your base layer of paint dries, apply 1-2 coats of a darker paint, like black or gray, on top of the original color.",
        "Once the top coats dry, use a wire brush to scrape away some of the darker paint.",
        "Scrape away as much or as little of the top layer as you\u2019d like.",
        "If you add 2 layers of top coat, make sure you let the first layer of paint dry before adding a second.",
        "Adding Extra Decorations Use a thin paint brush to paint small designs onto your pot.",
        "Dip a thin brush into the acrylic paint of your choice, then start sketching a design onto the newly painted surface of your pot.",
        "Apply the paint in soft, delicate strokes, taking care not to smear or smudge the design along the way.",
        "Try to use conservative amounts of paint when adding smaller designs\u2014if needed, you can always touch up the spot with more paint later on!",
        "Foam brushes might not be the best option for detail work.",
        "If you\u2019re using multiple colors in your decorative design, make sure to rinse and clean the thin brush in between uses.",
        "Add strips of painter\u2019s tape before you paint to create cool patterns.",
        "Cut or rip away long and short strips of painter\u2019s tape before placing them over the surface of your pot.",
        "Think of what kind of design you\u2019d like to create\u2014would you prefer to split the pot into 2 colors, or create a zig-zag shape?",
        "Once you\u2019ve picked out a design, press these sections of tape along the outer surface of your clay pot, then paint the pot.",
        "Once the paint around the tape dries, you can remove the strips.",
        "For instance, if you\u2019re creating a zig-zag shape, you\u2019ll need to rip away multiple short strips of tape.",
        "If you\u2019re painting the pot in 2 simple colors, you only need 1 long piece of tape to encircle the entire pot.",
        "Tie twine around the center of your pot if you don\u2019t want to use tape.",
        "Measure the circumference of your pot to determine the base length of your twine.",
        "Once you have this measurement on hand, add a minimum of 6 in (15 cm) to the existing length.",
        "Cut your piece of twine and wind it around the pot, using the extra section of string to tie your twine into a nice bow.",
        "If you want to better secure your twine into place, consider using hot glue.",

        "Now, you can leave fun messages and notes on your pots!",
        "You can add a second layer of chalk paint, if necessary.",
        "Chalk paint can be useful if you need to label herbs, flowers, and other plants.",
        "Cover your pot with fabric instead of paint.",
        "Lay out a piece of fabric that\u2019s large enough to surround your pot.",

        "Arrange the fabric carefully around the container, applying glue in sections and pressing the fabric into place around the pot.",
        "Apply glue to the inner rim of the pot, and attach 1 to 2 in (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of fabric to this portion.",
