                    "description": "For easier backstitching, use a shorter needle (about 1.25 in (3.2 cm) long) with a shorter (not elongated) eye. Once you get the thread through the eye, tie a knot at the end of the longer side of the thread by doing the following:Wrap the end of the long side of the thread loosely around your index finger 1-3 times. Use your thumb on the same hand to roll the loop off of your index finger. Grasp the loop with your thumb and forefinger and work it toward the end of the thread. It will tighten into a knot in the process."
