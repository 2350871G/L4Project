        "Make sure that you cut right along the outline; try not to leave any white edges.",
        "Bake the shapes on a parchment-lined baking sheet according to the instructions on the package.",
        "If your package does not have any instructions, bake the shapes at 350\u00b0F (176.6\u00b0C) in a pre-heated oven until the pieces lay flat.",
        "This can take anywhere between 5 minutes and 35 minutes.",
        "Don't worry if the pieces start to warp and curl while baking.",
        "They will eventually flatten back out.",
        "If you are using number 6 plastic, bake the pieces at 350\u00b0F (176.6\u00b0C) for about 3\u00bd minutes.",
        "Take the pieces out of the oven, and let them cool.",
        "If you want, you can bend them while they are still warm to give then an interesting shape.",
        "Seal the colored designs.",
        "You can use a spray-on or brush-on sealer.",
        "You can even paint on a few layers of a decoupage glue.",
        "Apply 3 to 4 layers; let each layer dry before you add the next one.",
        "This will give your pin a nice finish.",
        "It will also seal your art work and keep it from chipping.",
        "Glue a flat backed safety pin onto the back of the shape.",
        "Draw a line of hot glue across the back of the safety pin.",
        "Quickly flip the shape over, and press the safety pin onto the back.",
        "Try to center it as much as possible.",
        "Finished."
