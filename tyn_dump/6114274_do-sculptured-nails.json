Etching the nail makes it easier for the artificial nail product to adhere to the surface of the natural nail. Filing the nail from side-to-side could damage the nail plate layers. As a result, air, contaminants, and debris can wedge themselves into the nail bed and ruin the design of the finished nail.

The primer should remove oil and other moisture from the natural nail, allowing the artificial nail product to adhere more effectively. Do not touch the primed nail with your fingers since doing so could add more oil to the surface and cancel out the effect of the primer. Only use small amounts of primer since too much can irritate the nail and surrounding skin.

If the nail form doesn't fit properly, it will be difficult to apply the sculpted nail and the finished product will be more easily broken. Regular nailbeds can use standard nail forms.

        "Use any color nail powder you want, but it should be the color you plan to use for the tip of the sculpted nail.",
        "After positioning the bead over the free edge and form, tap down on the center of the bead with the side of your brush, spreading it over the entire free edge.",
        "Continue patting the bead with the side of your brush to sculpt the desired shape.",
        "Use the edge of the brush to push in the sides and align the edge of the artificial nail to the edge of the natural nail grove.",
        "Push along the seam of the bead with the tip of the brush to create a curve, then use the side of the brush to even out the tip of the artificial free edge.",
        "Place clear powder over the stress area.",
        "Reload the brush with nail liquid and dip it into clear powder.",
        "Once the powder absorbs the liquid, apply the bead to the stress area of the nail.",
        "Place the bead directly beneath the sculpted white tip.",
        "Pause for three seconds, then pat the bead over the edge of the white tip.",
        "This edge is known as the \"stress area\" since it is the spot that is weakest to potential breaks.",
        "Use the side of the brush to evenly smooth the clear product over the entire stress area and white tip.",
        "Apply pink powder to the center of the nail.",
        "Reload your brush with nail liquid and dip the tip into pink powder.",
        "After the powder absorbs the liquid, apply the ball to the center of the natural nail.",
        "Shape it over the top of the nail.",
        "If you do not want to use pink powder, use nail powder in whichever color you want for the main body of the nail.",
        "Place the ball halfway down the surface of the natural nail, keeping it away from the sculpted white edge.",
        "Let the ball flow naturally for three seconds.",
        "Use the side of the brush to stroke the color across the top half of the nail.",
        "Brush the ball to both sides of the nail, then draw up the color so that it meets the edge of the sculptured white tip.",
        "Apply pink powder to the cuticle area.",
        "Use more nail liquid and pink powder to create another bead of product.",
        "Apply this product to the lower half of the natural nail, then use your brush to spread it.",
        "Place this bead halfway between your lower cuticle and the edge of your previous bead.",
        "Allow the bead to flow naturally for three seconds.",
        "Use the side of the brush to evenly stroke the product over the rest of the exposed natural nail.",
        "Do not get any product directly on the cuticle.",
        "In fact, you should use a clean brush tip to gently direct the product away from the cuticle itself.",
        "Allow the powder to cure.",
        "Allow the sculpted acrylic to cure for several minutes before continuing.",
        "The product is fully cured once it feels dry and as hard as your natural nail.",
        "The exact curing time will vary depending on the nail liquid and nail powder you use.",
        "Check the label for precise guidelines.",
        "As the nail cures, you can use a c-shaping stick to perfect the shape of the side walls and new free edge.",
        "Remove the form.",
        "Once the nail product has cured, you can peel away the form.",
        "The form should lift away easily without causing any damage to the sculpted nail.",
        "Part Three: Finish the Sculptured Nail File into the final shape.",
        "Using a 180-grit nail file and 240-grit nail file, smooth the edges of the sculpted nail to even out any inconsistencies.",
        "Start with the 180-grit file, then work over the side walls of the nail.",
        "Once the sides look good, file down the free edge.",
        "Swap to your 240-grit file and work over the surface of the nail.",
        "Sand away any uneven lumps in the artificial nail surface.",
        "Tilt the 240-grit file slightly and continue working over the surface of the nail to perfect the contour.",
        "Use a clean nail brush to wipe away any dust when finished.",
        "Seal the nail.",
        "Apply a non-cleansing gel sealer over the finished nail, then cure the sealer under heat for two minutes.",
        "Brush a thin layer of the seal over the entire nail just as you would apply a top coat of polish.",
        "Start at the cuticle, then gradually work down toward the free edge.",
        "Place the nail beneath an LED heat lamp for two minutes to allow the sealer to cure.",
        "Note that some sealers may require more or less curing time, so it's best to check the label instructions before proceeding.",
        "Apply cuticle oil to the nail.",
        "Dab a small bead of cuticle oil onto the center of the nail.",
        "Use your fingers to rub the oil over the nail and into your cuticles.",
        "You only need a small droplet of oil for each nail.",
        "It should help condition your cuticles while giving the artificial nail a slight shine.",
        "Examine the finished nail and repeat as needed.",
        "This step completes the first sculpted nail.",
        "Repeat the sculpting process until all nails are evenly decorated.",
        "You can prepare your natural nails all at once, but the actual sculpting and finishing portions of the process must be completed one-by-one."
