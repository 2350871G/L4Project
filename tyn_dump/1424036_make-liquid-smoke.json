When the charcoal has burned and the coals are red hot, transfer the coals to the smoker. Spread out the coals on the charcoal pan and let the smoker heat up to high heat, or about 300 \u00b0F (149 \u00b0C). Smokers typically cook foods at a lower temperature than grills, because they are designed to cook through smoking rather than direct heat."
