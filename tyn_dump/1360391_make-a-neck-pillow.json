If you made a therapeutic pillow, heat it in the microwave at 1-minute intervals until it reaches the temperature you want. Shake the pillow between each interval to distribute the heat evenly. Making a Sock Pillow Get a clean, colorful sock. A crew sock that comes past your ankle will work well for this, but you can also use a knee sock as well. Do not use an ankle sock; it won't be long enough to drape around your neck. Pour enough uncooked rice to fill your sock into a measuring cup. Plan on using about 2 to 3 cups (370 to 555 grams) of rice. You can pour the rice straight into the measuring cup; if the cup isn't big enough to hold all the rice, use another container that has a spout. This will make it easier to pour the rice. Stir some essential oil into your rice, if desired. Add 10 to 15 drops of essential oil, then stir it in well so that it gets mix in evenly. You can use just one type of essential oil or a combination of different types. Lavender and peppermint are a great combination because of how relaxing they are. If you don't have essential oil but still want a bit of aromatherapy, try dried lavender, mint, or rose petals instead. Pour the rice into the knee sock until it is mostly full. You want the sock full enough so that you can still move it around. Leave about 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of space at the top of the sock so that you can sew it shut. You may not end up using all of the rice. If you have rice left over and you added essential oil to it, do not reuse it for cooking. If you don't have enough rice, pour some more in. If you used essential oil earlier, you may want to add in a couple more drops. Fold the top edge of the sock down twice. Most socks have a thin band at the top; use this as a guide. If your sock doesn't have such a band, fold it down twice by about 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters). You will be sewing in the next step. If you do not know how to sew, do not fold the sock down. Sew the folded edge down. You can do this on a sewing machine, or you can do it by hand with a needle and thread. Whichever method you choose, keep your stitches small and tight so that the neck pillow doesn't come apart. If you are using a sewing machine, backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to ensure that the stitches don't come apart. If you do not know how to sew, wrap a piece of yarn around the top of the sock a few times, then tie it into a secure knot. You can also use ribbon, string, rubber bands, or even a hair ties. Use the pillow. Place the pillow into the fridge or freezer to keep it nice and cool. When you need to use it, drape it around your neck. Most socks have a natural arch to them, so you can drape this part around the back of your neck. You can also heat the pillow up in the microwave at 1-minute intervals until it reaches the temperature you want. Shake the pillow between each interval. Sewing a Simple Pillow Find a terrycloth hand towel. Trim off any tags or labels. If you can't find a hand towel, you can use a larger towel or even a pillow case or t-shirt--jut be sure to cut them apart first. It needs to be at least 20 by 12 inches (50.8 by 30.48 centimeters). Fold the towel in half lengthwise. Most towels are the same on both sides, but if you have a fancier towel, it may have a right and wrong side. In this case, make sure that the right side is on the inside and the wrong side is on the outside. Sew along the long edge and one of the short edges.

Tuck the remaining edge of the pillow in by about \u215d inch (1.6 centimeters). If you need to, secure it with sewing pins. Sew the top edge of the pillow shut. You can do this either on a sewing machine or with a needle and thread. Keep the stitches small and tight. If you are using a sewing machine, remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. Use the neck pillow.

        "Use the pillow.",
        "Place the pillow into the fridge or freezer to keep it nice and cool.",
        "When you need to use it, drape it around your neck.",
        "Most socks have a natural arch to them, so you can drape this part around the back of your neck.",
        "You can also heat the pillow up in the microwave at 1-minute intervals until it reaches the temperature you want.",
        "Shake the pillow between each interval.",
        "Sewing a Simple Pillow Find a terrycloth hand towel.",
        "Trim off any tags or labels.",
        "If you can't find a hand towel, you can use a larger towel or even a pillow case or t-shirt--jut be sure to cut them apart first.",
        "It needs to be at least 20 by 12 inches (50.8 by 30.48 centimeters).",
        "Fold the towel in half lengthwise.",
        "Most towels are the same on both sides, but if you have a fancier towel, it may have a right and wrong side.",
        "In this case, make sure that the right side is on the inside and the wrong side is on the outside.",
        "Sew along the long edge and one of the short edges.",
        "Use a matching thread color and a \u215d-inch (1.6-centimeter) seam allowance.",
        "It would be easier to do this on a sewing machine, but you can do it by hand too, as long as you keep your stitches small and tight.",
        "If you are using a larger towel or material, the dimension within the stitching need to be 18 by 5 inches (45.72 by 12.7 centimeters).",
        "If you are using a sewing machine, backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
        "Turn the pillow inside out.",
        "If you made your pillow using a larger piece of material, trim the seam allowances down to about \u215d inch (1.6 centimeters) first.",
        "Add some dried lavender to your rice, if desired.",
        "Measure out enough rice to fill your pillow two-thirds of the way.",

        "Add \u00bc cup (10 grams) of dried lavender, then stir it in.",
        "You can also use another dried, fragrant herb, such as mint or rose.",
        "Fill the pillow two-thirds of the way with rice.",
        "This will ensure that the pillow is full enough to drape comfortable around your neck, but not so full that it feels stiff.",
        "Fold the top edge of the pillow in.",
        "Tuck the remaining edge of the pillow in by about \u215d inch (1.6 centimeters).",
        "If you need to, secure it with sewing pins.",
        "Sew the top edge of the pillow shut.",
        "You can do this either on a sewing machine or with a needle and thread.",

        "If you are using a sewing machine, remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing.",
        "Use the neck pillow.",
        "Heat the pillow in the microwave at 1-minute intervals until it reaches the temperature you want.",
