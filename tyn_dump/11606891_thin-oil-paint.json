Use a paint stirrer to mix the ingredients together so the paint has an even consistency. Always use a 2:1 ratio of paint to paint thinner when creating a thicker mixture.

For a thinner paint job, add in 2 cups (470 mL) of paint thinner into 1 cup (240 mL) of oil paint. Using a paint stirrer, mix these 2 substances together to create a watered-down base for your project. Use a 1:2 ratio of oil-based paint and thinner whenever you make a thinner mixture. Thinner coverage can work well for exterior painting projects that involve a lot of whitewashing. Don\u2019t add too much thinner at once. You can always make adjustments to your mixture later!"
