You can get your baby\u2019s attention by making a few strange sounds with your mouth or making funny faces. Try sticking out your tongue or making a distracting sound. Everything\u2019s new to a baby, so if it hears you make a sound that it\u2019s not used to or sees you make a face it hasn't seen before, it will be transfixed by you. Make sure not to make sounds that are too loud or faces that are too scary. You don\u2019t want to scare your baby.
