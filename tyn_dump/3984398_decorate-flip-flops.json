Dab super glue onto the straps of your flip-flops and place the rhinestones on top. Leave the glue to dry for 15 minutes before you wear the shoes to give it time to harden. Consider gluing on multiple rhinestones of different colors and sizes in a pattern of your choice. Beads, pearls, and sequins also make great decorations. Glue these on in the same way. Zig-zag patterns and color scale patterns look striking on flip-flops."

Wait 15 minutes for the glue to harden and then shake any excess glitter off the shoes. Gold and silver glitter looks fantastic with all different colors of flip-flops. Sprinkle the glitter outside or over scrap paper to avoid making a mess inside."

Try your flip-flops on and, if necessary, adjust the positioning of the clips so they're more comfortable. This works best with small clips, as larger barrettes tend to dig into your feet. Purchase hair clips from dollar stores or online. Consider using hair clips with flowers, animal figurines, or pom-poms on them.

Press each flower on and wait for it to dry before wearing. To add some extra sparkle, remove the center of the flower and glue a rhinestone into the empty space before gluing the flower onto the flip-flop.

Once you reach the end of the straps, cut the ribbon and glue the end in place. Repeat the wrapping process on both straps. Any type of ribbon will work for this activity. Use a full spool of ribbon to ensure that you have enough to wrap around both your straps, especially if you\u2019re decorating adult-sized flip-flops. You can add a cute touch to these flip-flops by tying a bow with any leftover ribbon and gluing it to the point where the two straps meet (between your big toe and the next toe.)"
