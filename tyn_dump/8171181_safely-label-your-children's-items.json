A label on the fabric of the clothing, however, will be difficult to remove without doing damage. Consider labeling the inside collar or bottom hem of shirts.

        "Always follow the directions that came with your iron-on label for best results.",
        "Some labels may require more or less time ironing, or more or less heat.",
        "Sew a name or identifying mark into the fabric, alternatively.",
        "If iron-on patches sound like more work than they're worth, you can always take a needle and thread and sew a simple label of your own into the fabric.",
        "If you're inexperienced at sewing, you can make a simple \"label\" by sewing an identifying mark in the fabric instead.",
        "Passing your needle and thread through the fabric a few times and tying off the end should be sufficient.",
        "Use scissors to cut any loose threads.",
        "With especially young children, thread pulled free from labels could be swallowed and lead to choking."
