The traditional ombre has a lighter color at the tips of your hair than at the roots, while a reverse ombre has darker tips and lighter roots. Select a shade that is no more than two shades lighter than your existing hair color. The more subtle the color change, the more natural and sun-kissed your hair will appear.

Ombre hair is more suitable for those with longer hair, as this makes you less likely to look like you have grown-out roots. The longer the hair, the further down the ombre can begin to work its contrast. In general, the jawline is a good place to have the two tones meet."

        "Bianca Cox\t\t\tHair Stylist and Licensed Cosmetologist\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: You can get a professional-looking balayage effect by splitting each of the sections into a top half, which will be seen, and a bottom half, which is underneath the visible hair.",
        "Then, you can either bleach only the top portions or leave the bleach on those sections for a longer time than the bottom ones.",
        "Choose an application tool.",
        "If you\u2019re using a dye or bleach kit, chances are you were provided with a small brush to apply the bleach.",
        "If not, the best option is to use an applicator brush.",
        "You can find these are your local beauty supply store.",
        "Alternatively, a similar soft, small brush will work well for application.",
        "Just make sure that you use a brush that you would be okay with tossing out after you are done.",
        "Begin bleaching your hair.",
        "Add bleach starting at the ends and working your way up to the desired fade line.",
        "Don\u2019t feel like you need to work fast or to work in large sections; work in such a way that you get all the strands evenly coated with the lightening product.",
        "Make sure that you apply the bleach evenly to both sides of your hair.",
        "Check in the mirror to make sure that the bleach starts at about the same spot on both sides.",
        "Make sure that you coat all of the hair that you want to bleach.",
        "Inspect your strands to check for any spots you may have missed \u2013 even saturation is key.",
        "To avoid a stark line or line of demarcation, apply the bleach using an applicator brush and take vertical strokes down the hair strand, rather than painting the hair in a horizontal motion.",
        "Let the bleach set.",
        "Depending on how light you want your hair to be, you will need to let the bleach set for anywhere from 10-45 minutes.",
        "To check, remove the bleach from a small strand of your hair after about 10-20 minutes.",
        "If you like the shade, remove the rest of the bleach.",
        "If you want to go lighter, leave it in and check again in 5-10 minutes.",
        "For a slight change in color, leave the bleach in for only 10-20 minutes.",
        "For a more bold change in color, leave the bleach for 40-45 minutes.",
        "Leaving the bleach in for longer will also help prevent orange or brassy tones.",
        "Wash out the bleach.",
        "Keeping your gloves on, rinse out the bleach with warm water.",
        "Then, wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo.",
        "Be sure to get out all the bleach, or your hair will continue to lighten.",
        "Don\u2019t condition your hair just yet.",
        "Coloring Your Hair Make sure your hair is dry.",
        "Use a towel to dry it off before beginning the coloring process.",
        "You may even want to wait for an hour or two to allow your hair to get mostly dry.",
        "Section off your hair once more.",
        "Divide your hair into its original sections.",
        "Tie off the ends with elastic bands or hair clips to make your dying job a bit easier.",
        "Use at least 2-3 sections, or as many more as you need to feel comfortable.",
        "Again, use non-metallic clips to avoid reactions with the dying chemicals.",
        "Put on gloves.",
        "Gloves generally come with a dye kit but if they don\u2019t, you can simply use normal rubber, vinyl, or latex gloves.",
        "Remember that it is very important to wear gloves when dyeing or bleaching your hair.",
        "If you do not, you will end up dyeing or bleaching your hands as well.",
        "Prepare your color.",
        "Most box hair dyes require a bit of measuring and mixing, so follow the instructions and prepare your dye.",
        "Make sure that you mix your dye in a well ventilated area.",
        "Brush in your color.",
        "Follow the application instructions that came with your hair dye to properly add it to your hair.",
        "If you\u2019re dying your hair with a traditional ombre (lighter ends), then apply the hair dye to all the bleached sections of hair and just a bit further up your strands as well.",
        "If you\u2019re doing a reverse ombre, add the color just up to the color fade line, and then a second heavier coat near the tips (similar to the bleach application).",
        "Make sure that you coat all of the hair that you want to dye.",
        "Inspect your strands to check for any spots you may have missed.",
        "As with bleach, even saturation with dye is very important.",
        "Let the color set.",
        "Follow the box instructions to be determine how long you should leave the dye in your hair.",
        "Wait the recommended amount of time for your hair dye to set.",
        "Since your hair has been bleached, you probably won\u2019t need to leave the dye in for more than ten minutes.",
        "Wash out the hair color.",
        "Keeping your gloves on, rinse out the dye with warm water.",
        "Then, wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo.",
        "Bleaching/coloring your hair can be very damaging, so take the time to use a deep conditioner to help add some moisture back into your locks.",
        "Dry and style your hair as usual.",
        "With your hair being a tad fried from the chemical dye, it may be best to allow it to air-dry and avoid any hot tools.",
        "However, if you\u2019re like most of us you\u2019ll want to blow dry your hair right away and get it looking back to normal.",
        "Doing this also allows you to determine if you\u2019ve gotten the color you want, or if you need to do some touching up post-dye."
