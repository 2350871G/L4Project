Typically, the base is screwed in, so turn the chair over and look for the screws holding it in place. Use a screwdriver or drill to unscrew them. Some seats just drop into place, in which case you can just push them out. If they're glued in, you may need to carefully pry the seats out or use a solvent that dissolves the glue. If you're doing more than one dining room chair, make sure you mark which seat came from which chair, as the seats will fit more easily back into place on the original chair. If your chair has a loose cushion, pull it out. For other chairs, you may need to take off legs or the rockers at the bottom to get to the fabric."

Save all the pieces of fabric, piping, and welting to use as patterns. Don't just throw these items away.

However, if it's still in good condition, you can save it to reuse. Keep it for now, though, so you can use it as a pattern. Batting is a layer of fabric that sits between the outside fabric and the foam. It adds a layer of protection and it keeps the cushioning in place. On large armchairs, you may not be able to replace the batting and foam since it's shaped to the chair. In that case, leave it in place. In some cases, you'll need to cut stuffing that has been glued into place. Use a knife with a long blade to slide neatly under it, such as a serrated knife or a snap-blade knife. Slide along and cut as carefully as you can."

Tighten up any screws or bolts on the bottom of the chair, which will help make it more stable. If you need to, add small L-shaped braces on the bottom of the chair where the legs attach to the seat. Screw part 1 part into the seat and 1 part into the leg, which will help stabilize the chair. Depending on your chair, you may need to wait to do this until after you've reattached the fabric. With some legs, you may need to glue them back in place to the seat. To help them stick, sand both sides of the wood where the joint meets.

You may need access to an industrial one, or you can send the pieces to someone else to stitch together for you. Make bias tape for the piping. Create bias tape by cutting 1.5 in (3.8 cm) strips diagonally across the grain of the fabric. Sew strips together with diagonal seams by placing 2 strips at a right angle to each other. Sew the strips together so you make a flat edge across the corner. Trim the corner off on the other side of the seam, then flatten the fabric out, and you'll have connected the strips. Keep joining strips this way until you have enough to do all the piping. Bias tape is just strips of fabric cut diagonally along the grain of the fabric (on the bias). Sew welting into the bias strip. Lay a piece of welting in the center of the bias tape on the wrong side of the fabric. Fold the fabric over the welting and pin it in place with sewing pins. Run a line of stitches along the fabric on the inside edge of the welting. Welting is a type of cord that you wrap in pieces of fabric to form piping. Use a zipper foot to sew the welting in place. Sew the piping into the fabric panel. Place the panel on the chair and pin it in place. Mark where the piping should go, and then pull the panel off. Lay the piping along the right side of the fabric and sew a line along the inner edge of the piping to hold it in place. You can also sew it between 2 panels if you're making a seam with piping. Attach the fabric to the chair, starting at the back. Put the back panel on, and staple it or tack it into place the same way it came off. If you need to, trim off any extra fabric as you go. Add the side pieces next, then work your way to the seat of the chair. Staple the fabric into place on the bottom last. Hammer any decorative tacks back in place if you'd like. Fold and staple fabric around the seat of the chair as needed. When folding fabric around the seat of a chair, start on one edge. Center the fabric and put one staple in the center of that edge. Flip it around and stretch it tight. Staple the fabric in place along that side, starting from the middle of the edge and working your way out, pulling the fabric tight as you do. Work your way around the rest of the seat, making sure the fabric is tight. Cut extra fabric off at the corners and fold them into place. If you are going around something like a dining room seat, make sure you trim off the extra fabric. Otherwise, it will bunch, leaving bumps in your finished product. To fold the corners, pull the fabric taut and fold the extra fabric in a triangle. Lay it flat against the edge of the seat, then pull it tight to staple the bottom edge underneath the seat. Add a piece of breathable black fabric under the chair. Cut a piece of fabric to match the piece you pulled off. Turn the chair over and staple the new piece into place over the fabric edges. This fabric will hide the edges and act as a dust cover for the bottom.",
