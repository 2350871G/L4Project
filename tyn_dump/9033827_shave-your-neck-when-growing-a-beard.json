Marlon Rivas\t\t\tProfessional Barber\t\t\t\tExpert Trick: To find the best neck line for your beard, look up, then find the deepest curve of your neck. Shave below that line, gradually angling up toward your jawline. Then, follow along your jawline closer to your ear to clean it up. That will help you maintain a clean appearance while you're growing out your beard."

Using the clippers, trim the base of your neck line in a perimeter of about one inch (two centimeters) out from your neck line. Shave everything outside this perimeter bare."
