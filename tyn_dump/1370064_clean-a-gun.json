Revolvers, shotguns, and most other sorts of guns will not need to be stripped to clean them. Field stripping is not necessary to clean the gun thoroughly. Don't take apart your gun more than you have to unless it requires repair. Likewise, some guns can't be stripped at all and it won't be necessary to do anything but open the chamber to clean it."
