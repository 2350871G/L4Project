Hammer flat-topped square-headed wooden stakes at each corner of the area and 4' to 6' apart in the ground in each direction.  Level the stakes with a carpenter's level placed on a board which is long enough to reach three stakes. Each stake should protrude from the ground by 3\u201d to 4\u201d. Adjust the stakes as necessary to ensure that they are all level. Always work with the board over three stakes; left to right, right to left or diagonally. Do this until all the stakes have been made level. Add some rich soil to top dress that already in place after all stakes have been adjusted. This topsoil should be uniformly level with the tops of all stakes. Fertilize the area according to the seed producer's instructions.  Scratch the surface area with a bamboo rake or a light lawn broom and your lawn area is ready to seed.  Seeding Lay out a grid in the area to be seeded with strings stretched between tent pegs at the sides and the ends to form rectangles not more than 10' across.

Rake the seed lightly into the surface with a bamboo rake or a lawn broom.  Roll or lightly tramp down the whole area to firm the seed in the soil.  Keep the area well watered. ",
