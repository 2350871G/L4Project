Switch to a finer grit sandpaper that ranges from 180 to 320 once the large pieces of plaster are gone in order to create a smooth, finished surface. If you notice any recessed areas, apply a thin layer of mud evenly with your trowel in between sanding passes. Allow the patches of mud to dry before going back over them with sandpaper.

Make sure to cover the floor with a painter's drop cloth before painting. Use a paint brush to edge around the perimeter of the room, being careful not to touch the walls with paint. You can apply thin strips of painter's tape around the tops of the walls, where they meet the ceiling, for added protection (if you haven't already hung plastic over them). Once the primer has dried, you'll be ready to apply one or two coats of your ceiling paint. The drying time could vary based on the humidity and temperature of the room, so it is best to test whether the paint is dry by touching it. If the paint feels sticky or rubs off easily onto your fingers, it is not completely dry before applying your paint over the coat of primer. Wait for the paint to dry completely, then reinstall any light fixtures or vent covers that you removed during the drywall installation process. To ensure that you don't damage your new coat of paint, it is best to let it dry overnight before attempting to reinstall any fixtures."

For example, if your ceiling measures 10 by 10 feet (3.0 by 3.0 m), then you'll know that you need to purchase enough fabric to cover 100 feet (30 m). You will likely need an assistant to help you hold one end of the tape measure while you take down the ceiling dimensions. Don\u2019t worry about purchasing fabric to match the exact size of your ceiling. You\u2019ll need to trim the pieces as you hang them in order to create the perfect fit.

If you are using one single sheet of fabric, begin stapling at the center of the room. Continue stapling in rows moving outward to the edges of the ceiling. Staple along the edges of the fabric where the ceiling meets the wall. Make sure to remove any light fixtures or ceiling vents before hanging the fabric. You may need to measure the location of the fixtures with a tape measure and cut corresponding holes in the fabric before it is hung. These can be reinstalled after your fabric is firmly in place. If you are using multiple strips of fabric, begin stapling at the edge of the room. Line the corner of the fabric up with the corner of the ceiling and place several staples close together along the edges. Continue stapling at a uniform distance along the edges of the fabric. Line up subsequent strips, allowing the edges to slightly overlap, and continue stapling in the same manner until the ceiling is completely covered. To create additional visual interest, you can gently bunch or fold the fabric before stapling. Keep in mind that this may require extra fabric. Calculate the number and size of your folds in order to determine how much extra fabric to purchase. If you prefer the ceiling to have a tent-like appearance, you can staple the center of the fabric and allow it to drape outward to the walls. You can then staple the edges of the fabric to the wall about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the ceiling. Creating this tent-like ceiling cover will require roughly 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) of extra fabric. The lower on the wall that you attach the fabric, in order to create a more dramatic drape, the more fabric you will need."

Choose a fabric from your local fabric shop or from an online fabric seller. Covering your ceiling with fabric is an ideal option if you rent and are not able to cover your popcorn ceiling with more permanent methods. The fabric ceiling covering can be easily removed and won\u2019t leave behind any lasting damage. Consider using flat bed sheets or painter\u2019s drop cloths, which may be cheaper than fabric. Choose a dark fabric color to create the illusion of openness, especially if you have a low-hanging ceiling. A darker ceiling than your walls can mimic the night sky, giving the impression of an open space. Look for interesting fabric patterns to add visual interest and character to your room. A patterned ceiling can anchor the design of any room. Measure your ceiling in order to know how much fabric to purchase. Using a tape measure, measure the dimensions of your ceiling. Because fabrics are sold in varying widths, you\u2019ll need to check your fabric\u2019s bolt size. By doing some quick math, you can figure out how many yards of fabric you will need to completely cover your ceiling. For example, if your ceiling measures 10 by 10 feet (3.0 by 3.0 m), then you'll know that you need to purchase enough fabric to cover 100 feet (30 m). You will likely need an assistant to help you hold one end of the tape measure while you take down the ceiling dimensions. Don\u2019t worry about purchasing fabric to match the exact size of your ceiling. You\u2019ll need to trim the pieces as you hang them in order to create the perfect fit. It is best to order more fabric than you will need in case you make any accidental cuts. Secure the fabric to the ceiling with a staple gun. Using an assistant, hold the fabric up to the ceiling to map out where you will place your first staples. If you are using one single sheet of fabric, begin stapling at the center of the room. Continue stapling in rows moving outward to the edges of the ceiling. Staple along the edges of the fabric where the ceiling meets the wall. Make sure to remove any light fixtures or ceiling vents before hanging the fabric. You may need to measure the location of the fixtures with a tape measure and cut corresponding holes in the fabric before it is hung. These can be reinstalled after your fabric is firmly in place. If you are using multiple strips of fabric, begin stapling at the edge of the room. Line the corner of the fabric up with the corner of the ceiling and place several staples close together along the edges. Continue stapling at a uniform distance along the edges of the fabric. Line up subsequent strips, allowing the edges to slightly overlap, and continue stapling in the same manner until the ceiling is completely covered. To create additional visual interest, you can gently bunch or fold the fabric before stapling. Keep in mind that this may require extra fabric. Calculate the number and size of your folds in order to determine how much extra fabric to purchase. If you prefer the ceiling to have a tent-like appearance, you can staple the center of the fabric and allow it to drape outward to the walls. You can then staple the edges of the fabric to the wall about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the ceiling. Creating this tent-like ceiling cover will require roughly 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5.1 cm) of extra fabric. The lower on the wall that you attach the fabric, in order to create a more dramatic drape, the more fabric you will need.",
