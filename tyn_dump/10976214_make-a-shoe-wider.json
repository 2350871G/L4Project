    "text": " Using a Hairdryer for Leather and Suede Shoes Put on a thick sock and slip on your shoe. Find the thickest sock that you own that will fit inside the shoe you want to widen. If you don\u2019t have a particularly thick sock, try wearing several thinner socks on your feet. This blow-drying method works best on leather and suede shoes. Heat the area that feels tight with a hairdryer for 20 \u2013 30 seconds. As you blow hot air onto your shoe, move your foot around inside your shoe. Push your foot against the area you want to widen to stretch the material. If the area still feels tight after blowing hot air on it for 20 \u2013 30 seconds, let it cool and then repeat the process. Avoid blowing hot hair on your leather shoe for more than 20 \u2013 30 seconds at a time. Applying continuous heat for long periods may damage your shoe. Try on the shoe with a normal sock once it starts to feel loose. Let your shoe cool down before taking it off. Then, slip off the thick sock and put on the type of sock that you would normally wear with the shoe. If the shoe still feel too snug, slip your thick sock and shoe on again and repeat the blow-drying process. Apply leather conditioner to your leather shoe to restore moisture. The hot air from your hairdryer will dry out your leather shoe. Applying a leather conditioner or cream immediately after blowing your shoe with hot air will help prevent the leather from cracking. Gently rub the leather conditioner onto your shoe as if you were applying moisturizer to your skin. Widening Your Shoe with Frozen Water Place a sealable plastic bag in your shoe. Position the bag so its bottom is laying on the bottom of the inside of your shoe. Then, use your hand to spread the bag out so that it molds to the shape of your shoe. A 1 US gal (3.8 L) sized bag should be large enough for most shoes. Place a second bag inside this first one if you\u2019re nervous about water leaking into your shoe. Pour water into the bag until your shoe is full. Use a liquid measuring cup or pitcher to fill the bag with water. Once your shoe is full of water, seal the bag securely so that no water will leak out. Pour the water into the bag slowly so that you don\u2019t accidently spill any onto your shoe.

This freezing water method works best for shoes made of non-leather materials, including plastics, faux leather, and fabric, but should work for any kind of shoe. Stretching Your Shoe with a Shoe Stretcher Reduce the width of the toe block before inserting it into your shoe. On most shoe stretchers, you\u2019ll turn the handle counterclockwise to reduce the width of the stretcher. If you have a two-way stretcher (a shoe stretcher that can make your shoe wider and longer), you\u2019ll also need to adjust the heel block so that it\u2019s as close to the toe block as possible.

If the shoe stretcher is too wide, try another stretcher or one of the other methods listed above. Turn the widening handle to widen your shoe. Turn the widening handle until you start to feel resistance. Then, give it another 3 turns. On most shoe stretcher models, you\u2019ll turn the widening handle clockwise to widen the toe block.
