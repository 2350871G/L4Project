Use a sander to smooth all the previously cut pieces. Making the Frame Start with the assembly of the table as shown in the picture above. Use a clamp when assembling every piece and make sure that all the joints are at 90 degree angles. Drill a hole one or two sizes smaller than the screw. Then put the screw through that hole. That ensures the screw will get where you wanted it to go. Do not try to put the screw in if you haven't drilled the hole first. After the frame is completed, you need to put two 168 cm (66.1 inches) planks on the left and the right side of the frame, as shown in the picture above. The planks enhance the stability of the legs and add to the visual appearance of the table. Adding the Plate Choose the plate planks. Now it's time to put the plate of the table on the frame. For the plate of the table you will use 92 cm (36.2 inches) planks. Attach the planks. Every plank must be screwed down on four places; that means on every plank of the frame. This is important because it is very hard to acquire completely dry wood and if you don\u2019t tighten it down, it will bend and your table will be ruined. On the picture you can see how to assemble the plate on the frame. Leave 1 cm (1/3 of an inch) space between every plank on the plate, for visual appearance. Attaching the Legs Use the appropriate planks for the legs. For the legs you will use 74 cm (29.1 inches) planks. Attach the legs with 7 cm (3 inch) wood screws. Put three screws on every leg, so that they form a perfect triangle.",
