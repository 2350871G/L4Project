Use the pad of your finger to make sure the coffee filter is dry.The coffee filter will likely be dry in 1-2 hours. Making Butterfly Wings Scrunch the middle of the dry coffee filter to create 2 wings. Find the center of the coffee filter, then press the edges of the filter toward each other. Use your fingers to squish down on the center to create the wings of the butterfly.The center of the coffee filter will become the butterfly\u2019s body, while the sides will be the wings.
