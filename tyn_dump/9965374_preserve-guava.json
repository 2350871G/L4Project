If the guavas aren't ripe yet, let them sit on the counter for 2-3 days until the skin yields when you press on the fruit. Avoid placing guava near a window because the heat and light can make it ripen too quickly. If the guava is taking a long time to ripen, try placing it in a paper bag with the top slightly open."

Leave the bag open slightly at the top to let air circulate through the bag and the drawer. If possible, store the guava in a separate drawer from other fruits such as apples or oranges, which can cause the guava to go bad quickly."
