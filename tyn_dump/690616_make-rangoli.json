You can use a plant or animal for inspiration, or you can create your own geometric design. Depending on your skill level as an artist, you can choose small, basic geometric or floral designs, or venture into designing larger, more complex animals, gods, or goddesses (like the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, who is traditionally honored during Diwali). Flowers such as the lotus are very popular for Rangoli. Some other traditional designs are fish, snakes, tridents, and the peacock - India\u2019s national bird. You can also buy ready-made stencils to make the application even easier, or you can make your own. Stencils are easy to use and offer a variety of designs."

                    "description": "You can draw it on a flat, dry floor inside or outside of your home, or you can draw it on paper to display anywhere. The earliest Rangoli were created in small 2x2 patterns, but can now be any size, even covering entire floors. The size of your design can help determine where you should draw your Rangoli. If you\u2019re just starting out, it is best to create your Rangoli on black paper, since there is more room for error on an erasable surface. The bright colors of your design will stand out beautifully against the black background. If you go this route, glue the paper to a piece of cardboard to give it some backing and structure. If you decide to make your Rangoli on the floor, be sure to do it in a place that won\u2019t disturb normal walking routes."
