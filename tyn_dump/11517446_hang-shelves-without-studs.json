        "Other shelves rest atop metal shelf brackets.",
        "Mounting brackets typically come packaged with new shelves.",
        "If you need brackets, you can buy them at a hardware store.",
        "Use a 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm)-long drill bit to create pilot holes.",
        "This will depend on the size of the wall anchors you plan on using.",
        "Choose a drill bit that is the same diameter as the wall anchor.",
        "Then, drill all the way through the drywall or plaster.",
        "Try using a 2 \u20442 in (6.4 cm)-long drill bit to break through it without hitting anything behind the wall.",
        "Interior drywall is most commonly \u20442 in (1.3 cm) thick.",
        "Plaster is \u20448 in (2.2 cm) thick.",
        "If you know the thickness, use a matching drill bit to cut cleanly through the wall.",
        "Keep in mind that the wall may have wires, wood framing, and other components behind it.",
        "To avoid hitting these things, drill gradually.",
        "Check the hole often and stop drilling once you\u2019re able to see all the way through it.",
        "Using Drywall Anchors Tap the anchors into the pilot holes with a hammer.",
        "A wall anchor is shaped like a screw with a threaded end on one side.",
        "Fit the threaded end into one of the pilot hole you made earlier.",
        "Hold the anchor up and tap its head a few times.",
        "Push it into the wall enough so that it stays there when you let go of it, but don\u2019t force it all the way in yet.",
        "Check the weight limit when shopping for drywall anchors.",
        "They come in different sizes, but the biggest ones can bear 30 to 50 lb (14 to 23 kg).",
        "However, try to limit the weight placed on them to ensure they stay in the wall.",
        "Screw the wall anchors clockwise until they are flush with the wall.",
        "Insert a Phillips screwdriver into the opening on the anchor\u2019s head.",
        "Turn it like you would with a regular screw.",
        "Make sure it\u2019s level with the wall, but don\u2019t overtighten it or else it could damage the wall.",
        "For a faster installation, use a drill.",
        "Be careful not to spin the anchors too much, though.",
        "Keep the heads level with the surrounding wall.",
        "Fit the mounting brackets over the anchors and screw them together.",
        "Hold the brackets against the wall, aligning the screw holes with the anchors.",
        "Then, fit a screw into each hole.",
        "Turn them clockwise with a screwdriver or drill until they are about flush with the anchors.",
        "Check to make sure the brackets are well-secure before continuing.",
        "The anchors often come with screws when you purchase them.",
        "The exact screw size needed depends on the anchor, but they should be roughly the same size.",
        "Many anchors use \u204432 in (0.24 cm)-wide screws.",
        "Be careful not to tighten the screws too much.",
        "It could strip the threads, making the screws difficult to remove later.",
        "Hang the shelf on the mounting brackets.",
        "Position the shelf on the wall.",
        "With some setups, the shelf rests on top of the brackets.",
        "Fit a floating shelf by pushing it onto the bracket instead.",
        "Then, check the shelf to make sure it\u2019s sturdy and ready to bear the weight of whatever you put on top of it.",
        "Installing Molly Bolts Slide a bolt through each of the pilot holes in the wall.",
        "The bolts have a metal tip on one end that is meant to go into the wall first.",
        "Make sure the bolt\u2019s shaft is flat and unopened so it fits through the hole.",
        "Push it in as far as you can.",
        "The tip of the bolt will emerge from the opposite side of the wall.",
        "Some types of bolts have flanges on the end that expand once the bolt is in the wall.",
        "Squeeze the flanges against the bolt\u2019s shaft, if possible, to close up the bolt so it fits through the pilot hole.",
        "Molly bolts generally support up to 50 lb (23 kg) of weight and work for both drywall and plaster walls.",
        "They are a good choice for medium-sized shelving.",
        "Turn the bolts clockwise until the heads are flush with the wall.",
        "Make sure the bolts are level with the wall first.",
        "Then, use a Phillips screwdriver or drill fit with a Phillips bit.",
        "Turning the screws opens the flanges on the bolt\u2019s shaft, keeping it secure against the wall.",
        "Pull on each bolt to ensure it\u2019s secure and stable.",
        "Stop turning the bolts once you feel resistance.",
        "Continuing to rotate them could strip the threads or damage the wall.",
        "Once the flanges open, you can turn the screws counterclockwise a few times so they stick out from the wall a little more.",
        "Use this to help ensure the brackets are rest flush against the wall.",
        "Rotate each bolt screw counterclockwise to remove it from the wall.",
        "Use a screwdriver or drill to remove it.",
        "The bolt will stay in place thanks to the flanges clinging to the wall.",
        "The screw leaves behind an open hole for you to use when installing the brackets.",
        "Save the screws for reuse.",
        "Keep a small container nearby to drop the screws in while you\u2019re working.",
        "Screw the brackets to the molly bolts.",
        "Reuse the screws you removed from the molly bolts.",
        "If you need new ones, match them to the bolt size you are using.",
        "Hold the brackets over the molly bolts, fit the screws in place, then rotate them clockwise to secure the brackets.",
        "Try using \u204432 in (0.24 cm)-wide bolts if you have to get replacements.",
        "It\u2019s the average size many molly bolts use, so you may still need a different size.",
        "Place the shelves on the brackets to hang them.",
        "Fit the shelf into place according to the type of bracket you have.",
        "Most of the time, all you have to do is rest the shelf on top of the brackets.",
        "Test the shelf and brackets by attempting to move them.",
        "Make sure the brackets are stable before putting anything on top of them.",
        "Using Heavy Toggles Fit the metal ends of the toggles into the pilot holes.",
        "Hanging toggles have a metal tip on one end and a long plastic strap on the other end.",
        "The metal tip is the one that goes into the wall.",
        "Push it all the way through the hole you made.",
        "Set a different toggle in each hole.",
        "Toggle bolts are the best option for shelves between 30 and 50 lb (14 and 23 kg).",
        "Some bolts can bear more weight than that.",
        "They also work for both drywall and plaster.",
        "Slide the plastic ring toward the wall if your bolts have them.",
        "Look for a small ring along the center part of the plastic strap.",
        "Hold onto the ring with one hand while holding the end of the strap with your other hand.",
        "Then, pull the plastic strap toward you while also pushing the ring back toward the wall.",
        "The flanges on the shaft will open, securing the bolt to the inner part of the wall.",
        "Note that there are also metal spring toggles that work similarly to molly bolts.",
        "Since they don\u2019t have plastic straps, slot them through the mounting brackets and into the wall, then tighten them.",
        "Snap the plastic end off the bolt if it has one.",
        "Grasp the plastic strap near where it emerges from the wall.",
        "Bend it down, then bend it back up again.",
        "It should detach, leaving only the bolt behind.",
        "If you\u2019re having a hard time removing the strap, pull the ends of the strap apart.",
        "Then, push them against the wall until they crack.",
        "Screw the brackets to the open toggles.",
        "With the plastic straps out of the way, you can screw the brackets to the toggles.",
        "Hold the brackets up to the wall, aligning the screw holes with the toggles.",
        "Fit a screw in each one.",
        "Then, turn the screws clockwise until they are tight and almost level with the brackets.",
        "Make sure the screws are straight.",
        "If they are crooked, they won\u2019t fit cleanly in the toggles.",
        "Also, don\u2019t overtighten them.",
        "Hang the shelves on the brackets.",
        "Test the brackets first by touching and attempting to move them.",
        "If they don\u2019t feel stable, check to make sure the brackets are well-secured and that the toggles are flush with the wall.",
        "Make adjustments as needed before putting anything on the shelves."
