Look for a label on the circuit you are working with. The power is measured in watts. This value measures the amount of energy used or made in a given amount of time. For example 1 Watt = 1 Joule/ 1 second. This value is necessary to calculate the current, measured in amperes (amps for short). Find the voltage. Voltage is the electrical potential of a circuit and should also be listed on a label along with power. It is created because one side of the circuit is electron dense and the other side is electron poor. This causes an electric field (the voltage) to exist between the two points.
