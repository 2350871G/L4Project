If your stitches were inserted after a surgical procedure, or if the recommended healing time (usually 10-14 days) hasn't elapsed, removing them yourself can put you at greater risk for infection and may prevent your body from healing properly. Your skin needs to have grown back together before your stitches are removed. Keep in mind that when you go to the doctor, adhesive strips are often placed on the skin after stitch removal to continue to facilitate the healing process. If you do it at home, you may not be getting the care you require. If you want to double check whether it's OK to remove your stitches, give your doctor a call. He or she will let you know whether it's safe enough to do it yourself. However, they will likely recommend you come into the office to get your stitches removed. If your wound looks as if it's getting red or more sore, do not remove your stitches: go to your doctor. You may have an infection. Keep in mind that in many cases, you can get your stitches removed without going through the regular doctor's appointment process. You might be able to walk right in for a quick stitch removal. It's likely that a nurse can check your wound and remove the stitches if the wound has healed. Call your doctor and ask."
