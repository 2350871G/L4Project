Then, add about 6 drops of a liquid dish soap. When you leave the mixture out in a container like a Mason jar, the gnats will be unable to fly out of it once they get in it. Try leaving the mixture in a lidded jar or a deep bowl covered with plastic. Poke holes in the lid so the gnats have a place to enter. Replace the mixture as it fills with gnats. To make the mixture more potent, you can add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (12 \u00bd g) of sugar. Old fruit also works very well. Another option is to use old red wine. The more it tastes like vinegar, the better it will be. Add 6 drops of dish soap, since it prevents gnats from being able to fly out."

Look for chemical products designed for use on flying insects. Spray the chemical throughout your kitchen about once a day until the gnats are gone. For safety, stay out of the kitchen until the spray has had a chance to dissipate. Consider wearing a mask when using a spray. Make sure all of your food is well-sealed as well. Then, clean all surfaces thoroughly after the spray has finished working. Note that chemical sprays can be toxic or at least unpleasant to be around. Although many of them are supposed to be safe for indoor use, you might want to leave your house while the insecticide is active."
