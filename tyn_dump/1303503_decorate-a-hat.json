For example, rounder faces look best in hats that have some height and aren\u2019t too close to the face, like a medium-brimmed fedora. Baseball caps, wide-brimmed straw hats, fedoras, cowboy hats, top hats, and beanies can all be customized in different ways."

Craft stores will often have short ends of fabric on sale. For a grander hat consider: ribbon, feathers, fake flowers,sequins, tulle, and glitter. Regardless of the extent of your decoration, make sure you have scissors and some type of glue on hand. Especially for bulkier decorations like feathers, hot glue works best and glues easily."
