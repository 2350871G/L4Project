Use a flat, mid-sized brush you have available to draw a rough circle. The circle doesn't have to be perfect. Make it as big as you want the rose to be. The color you use in this step will be the color of the finished rose. For example, use red for a red rose, pink for a pink rose, or yellow for a yellow rose. Use a wide brush to fill in the circle if you wish. Choose a shade that is slightly darker than the rose's primary color."

If you don't have a palette to work with, blend the colors on a scrap piece of paper.

        "Wiggle the brush up and down slightly to create a shape like a scallop shell.",
        "Create comma-shaped lines to close the inner petal.",
        "After double loading your brush, position the edge with white paint underneath the side of the innermost petal.",
        "Paint a line diagonally down, then curve it back inwards about halfway between the surrounding petals.",
        "Repeat this on the other side.",
        "When completing these U-shaped strokes, start with the tip or chiseled edge of the brush, then position the brush so it is flat horizontally as you drag it down.",
        "The third layer may not be necessary, but it adds more depth to your rose if you have the space for it.",
        "Evaluate the way your rose looks to determine whether or not to include it.",
        "Add more curves between the petals to create additional details.",
        "A great place for extra petals is underneath the innermost petals.",
        "Hold the brush vertically, keeping the side loaded with white paint above the side loaded with the rose's main color.",
        "Drag the brush diagonally down, then sweep it back towards the rose's center.",
        "Position these petals about halfway between the other petals.",
        "These petals are generally very thin and curve around the U-shaped stroke you made earlier.",
        "Add small petals on the outside of the rose or in other areas.",
        "Use a smaller brush as needed to finish your design.",
        "Let the paint dry and add more details as needed.",
        "Your rose is mostly done at this point.",
        "Give the paint about 30 minutes to dry.",
        "In the meantime, take a look at your work and identify any changes you wish to make.",
        "Paint over any parts of the rose you need to alter before the paint dries.",
        "Add additional details as needed.",
        "For example, dab gold paint onto the rose's center to detail pollen.",
        "Alternatively, double load your brush with light and dark green paint, then use it to add leaves.",
        "Making a Rose through Layering Draw a circle with a light color of paint.",
        "Load a flat, mid-sized paintbrush with paint in a light shade of your main color.",
        "Apply the paint to paper, creating a basic circle.",
        "It doesn't have to be even and may, in fact, look like a lumpy cloud.",
        "For example, use a very light pink if you wish to make a pink rose.",
        "The light shade will provide a base, but you will end up painting over most of it with darker shades.",
        "Spread more paint to outline the curved shape of the petals.",
        "Dip the flat brush back in the light shade of paint, then use it to finish your basic outline.",
        "In particular, try to outline where you plan on placing the petals.",
        "For instance, make shorter, pronounced U-shaped curves along one side of the circle's upper edge.",
        "Progress into longer, shallower lumps along the opposite lower edge.",
        "Another way to do this is by pencil.",
        "If you're good at sketching, forgo the paint circle and draw the petals.",
        "Then, follow up with a light coat of paint to give them definition.",
        "Color in the outer curves with a darker shade of paint.",
        "Use either the medium flat brush or switch to a smaller pointed brush.",
        "Load about half of the brush with a darker shade of the rose's primary color, then use it to fill in some of the outline.",
        "The best place to add the darker shade is along the inner edges of the petals.",
        "This creates the appearance of shadows on the petals.",
        "Apply the darker paint in curves along the petal lumps in your outline.",
        "Try placing tighter curves along the rose's upper edge and looser curves along the lower edge.",
        "Try placing each curve of dark paint at a slightly different level so their tails do not connect.",
        "You will be able to see the basic outline of each petal forming from the contrasting shades.",
        "Paint over the outer part of the remaining petals with darker paint.",
        "Paint the inner part the same way you did the outer part using the same brush as before.",
        "Apply the darker shade of paint in rough U-shaped curves to delineate each petal.",
        "Gradually fill in the unpainted space between the petals.",
        "As a general rule, fill \u2154 of the rose with short curves similar to the uppermost ones.",
        "Fill in the remaining \u2153 with longer curves like the lower ones.",
        "Note that the curves need to gradually become tighter as you get nearer to the center of the rose.",
        "Apply white paint to the outer edge of each petal.",
        "Clean your brush, then sideload it again with the paint.",
        "Use a smaller brush for more precision.",
        "Spread the white paint along the outer edge of each petal.",
        "Keep the light coloring opposite of the darker sections.",
        "The white paint is used to mimic light falling on the petals.",
        "It also contrasts against the primary color, giving your rose more definition.",
        "Draw a swirl in the center of the rose.",
        "After washing your brush, load it with the darker shade of the rose's primary color.",
        "Directly in the center of the rose, draw a spiral by making a series of tight circles.",
        "Expand the circles as you move outwards towards the nearby petals.",
        "The spiral usually curves upwards in most roses, but depending on how you painted the surrounding petals, you can change its direction.",
        "Let the paint dry for 30 minutes when you're done painting.",
        "Make sure you're satisfied with your work before you set it aside.",
        "Continue adding white or darker shades of the rose's primary color to give the rose more definition.",
        "Try adding more white and dark streaks as needed to create contrast.",
        "Wash the rose with the original color shade if desired.",
        "With a clean brush, apply very small amounts of the underlying shade of your rose's primary color.",
        "Paint over the entire rose with a very thin, even layer of paint.",
        "When this is done correctly, it washes out the other colors, making them look more evenly blended.",
        "This step can be difficult and it isn't necessary.",
        "If you like your rose as it is, leave it alone.",
        "Adding too much pain covers up the rose's details."
