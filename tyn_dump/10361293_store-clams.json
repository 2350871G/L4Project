If any clams are open and do not shut when you tap on them, or if they float in water, they are dead and should be discarded immediately. Also, if you see any broken or damaged shells, throw those clams out right away. It\u2019s important to throw out dead clams right away so they don\u2019t contaminate those that are still alive. The clams should have a fresh smell that reminds you of the ocean. If the clams smell fishy or they have an ammonia-like smell, throw them out. Soft-shell clams have a long neck, so they may not close completely."
