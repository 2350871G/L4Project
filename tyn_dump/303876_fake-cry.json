If you can\u2019t pull from any moments from real life or you\u2019re afraid that your personal experience will make you feel too much, make up a scenario that makes you sad or think of a part in a movie that made you cry. Some examples you can think of to help you feel sad are the death of a pet or someone close to you, a memory of someone or something you miss, or a really bad breakup. If you\u2019re fake crying for acting, find a situation that relates to what your character is going through. Focus on the emotions you want to feel rather than trying to cry. When you tell yourself you need to cry, you\u2019re focusing on the results rather than what you need to feel at the moment. Focus on your body, breathing, and expressions instead."

Pretend you\u2019re holding a staring contest with someone and keep your eyes open for as long as you can. If you haven\u2019t made tears and you feel the urge to blink, hold your eyes open with your fingers. Fan your eyes with your hands to make them dry out faster and produce more tears. Sometimes if you keep them half-closed, tears will start to form in the corners of your eyes. Don\u2019t let anything harmful get in your eyes as you keep them open. Practice doing this indoors where there is less likely of a chance for something to blow into them."

To simulate crying, recreate the effect of hyperventilation by taking rapid, shallow breaths. Not only will add to your believability, but it will help your body make tears. To calm down, start taking deeper breaths. Hyperventilating too much will prevent healthy amounts of oxygen from getting into your blood. Only do this in short bursts to start your tears."
