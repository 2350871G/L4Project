                    "description": "Before you decide to strip the covers off of you mattress and search for holes, know that no air mattress holds air indefinitely. You will naturally have to re-inflate your mattress whether or not you have a leak. Cold air, for example, causes your mattress to shrink. As the house cools down at night, your air mattress will likely soften a bit as the air cools. A space heater by the mattress can prevent this problem. Air mattresses need to \u201cstretch\u201d after they are bought. Don\u2019t be alarmed if they feel soft shortly after you inflate them the first few times, they will quickly adapt."

Sit on the mattress after you blow it up \u2013 it should not sink more than 1-2 inches under your weight. If you are still not sure if there is a leak, leave your mattress inflated overnight and put weight on it, like several textbooks. If it is more than a little deflated in the morning, you have a leak. Keep the mattress inflated as you search for the leak. If you feel the mattress becoming soft, reinflate it before you start searching again.

        "Deflate and dry the mattress completely.",
        "Once you\u2019ve found and marked your hole, let all the air out of the mattress.",
        "If you used the soapy water method to find the leak, pat the mattress dry with a towel and leave it in the sun for at least 1-2 hours before returning to it.",
        "Using a Patch Kit Buy a patch kit.",
        "Almost every outdoor store will have these in the camping section.",
        "They are small, cheap sets that contain glue, sandpaper, and patches for tents, bike tires, and air mattresses.",
        "If you are in a pinch and the hole is small, a tire patch made for cycling should work fine.",
        "Some companies have dedicated air mattress repair kits that you can find online, such as the Thermarest Repair Kit, Tear-Aid, and the Sevylor Repair Patch.",
        "Make sure that the patch kit works on plastic or vinyl.",
        "Completely deflate the mattress.",
        "You don\u2019t want any air getting under your patch and ruining the glue, so let all the air out the mattress before continuing.",
        "Sand away any soft felt near your hole.",
        "If your hole is on the top side of the mattress you\u2019ll need to remove the soft covering to make the patch stick.",
        "Take a wire brush or some sandpaper and lightly remove the felt coating until you only have plastic surrounding your leak.",
        "Some mattress makers refer to this soft coating as \u201cflocking.\u201d Clean and dry the area around your leak.",
        "Using soapy water or a little isopropyl alcohol, clean off the leaky area so that there is no dust, dirt, or debris surrounding the hole.",
        "Dry it completely before continuing.",
        "Cut out a patch roughly one and a half times bigger than your hole.",
        "You want ample room to cover the leak, so cut your patch so it fits over the hole with a centimeter or more of the patch around every side.",
        "If your patches are pre-cut, use one that offers 1-2 centimeters of space around the hole itself.",
        "Apply the patch according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions.",
        "All patches function in one of two ways: they are simply applied like stickers, or you must apply special glue and then attach the patch.",
        "Either way, follow the instructions and apply your patch smoothly.",
        "Don\u2019t remove it to get it \u201cperfect.\u201d As long as it covers the leak entirely it will work, and taking it off and reapplying it will make it less sticky.",
        "Press down on the patch with firm, even pressure.",
        "Once your patch is on, apply pressure to it for 30 seconds or more to make sure it is firmly attached.",
        "Use the heel of your hand to press down on the patch, or use a rolling pin to strongly flatten the patch against the mattress.",
        "Let the glue dry on the patch for 2-3 hours.",
        "It can help to lay a heavy, flat object on top of the patch to keep the pressure on it.",
        "Do not try to inflate your mattress until the glue is dry.",
        "Inflate the mattress and check for leaks.",
        "Place your ear right next to the patch and listen for any escaping air.",
        "If no one needs it to sleep, leave the mattress inflated overnight and return in the morning to make sure no more air is escaping.",
        "Patching Your Leak without a Patch Kit Know that DIY fixes may void your warranty.",
        "Many manufacturers request that you only use patch kits, or you send the mattress back to them for repair.",
        "Though effective, DIY patches can lead you to lose your warranty on the mattress, so proceed with caution.",
        "Duct tape can be a temporary fix.",
        "Though effective in the short term, the glue on duct tape is not made to permanently bind to plastic, and it will eventually dry out and fall off.",
        "Never use hot glue to fix a leak.",
        "Hot glue will, in almost all cases, melt part of your air mattress and make the hole bigger.",
        "Sand away the soft felt around your leak if it is on the top of the mattress.",
        "This fuzz, though comfortable, will prevent your glue or patches from completely binding around the leak, causing it to fall off shortly after applying.",
        "Take a wire brush or some sandpaper and lightly scrub away the felt coating until there is only plastic around your leak.",
        "Cut out a square of thin, malleable plastic, like a shower curtain.",
        "If you\u2019re out of professional patches or cannot buy one, you can still improvise a patch from things around the house.",
        "Tarps and shower curtains work well and are easily cut to size.",
        "Make sure your square is big enough to cover the leak, with at least one extra centimeter on every side.",
        "Attach the DIY patch with strong glue.",
        "Cover the leak in a generous amount of glue at least the size of your patch.",
        "Do not try this with your child\u2019s bottle of craft glue.",
        "You need a strong, reliable adhesive, such as superglue, KrazyGlue, or Gorilla Glue, to adhere your patch.",
        "Press your patch into the glue and hold it there.",
        "Use strong, even pressure to press the patch into the glue.",
        "Smooth out the patch with your fingers and gently wipe away any excess glue around the edges of the patch.",
        "Place a heavy object on top of the patch and return in 6-8 hours.",
        "Use several heavy books, a weight, or similarly heavy objects and place them on top of the patch to keep the pressure up as it dries.",
        "When you return the patch should be firmly adhered to the mattress."
