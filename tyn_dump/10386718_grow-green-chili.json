An overripe chili will be red and beginning to shrivel a bit. Seeds from a chili that isn't ripe yet may not germinate because the seeds aren't mature.

        "An 8\u201310 in (20\u201325 cm) pot works best, though you can use one that\u2019s a bit smaller and transfer the plant again later on, if needed.",
        "When you move the plant to the larger pot, add in some fresh soil and water the soil well once you\u2019re finished.",
        "It should take roughly 1 month for the seedlings to grow tall enough to be transplanted.",
        "Feel free to place this pot outdoors instead of just inside the house.",
        "Use a well-draining, fertile soil.",
        "You can find nutrient-rich soils at a garden or nursery store.",
        "If desired, add a little bit of organic compost to the soil that will keep your chili plant healthy and happy.",
        "Check the instructions on your compost to know how much to add to the soil.",
        "Make sure the pot has excellent drainage.",
        "One way to help ensure the water drains well is to sprinkle coarse gravel at the bottom of the pot.",
        "This makes it easier for the water to drain out and the pot\u2019s drainage holes won\u2019t get clogged with soil as easily.",
        "Always check your pot to make sure it has adequate holes for draining.",
        "If you\u2019re setting the plant indoors on a table or windowsill, place a dish or tray underneath the pot to catch any excess water.",
        "Avoid damaging the roots when transferring the plant.",
        "Be super careful not to pull the plant out of the cell tray and instead use a small shovel to gently dig around the roots to loosen them from the soil.",
        "Move the entire root ball into the new soil and pot, covering the roots with soil so that they\u2019re covered up again.",
        "If you're worried about damaging the roots with the shovel, use a spoon to gently move the soil.",
        "Maintaining Your Plants Ensure the chili plant gets at least 6 hours of sunlight a day.",
        "Keep the plant in a warm, sheltered spot, such as on a windowsill.",
        "6 hours of sunlight a day is the minimum amount of light needed for them to grow, though more sunlight is better.",
        "Wherever you place your chili plant, make sure the temperature doesn\u2019t drop below 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F).",
        "Full sunlight is required to grow peppers, so you want to keep them outdoors for as long as possible.",
        "Water the plant 2-3 times a week.",
        "It\u2019s okay if the plant gets a little dry in between the watering days, as chili plants like to dry out a bit.",
        "When you water the soil, give it a nice, thorough watering and make sure the soil is still damp once you\u2019re finished.",
        "If the soil is mushy or water is constantly draining from the pot, this is a sign that you\u2019re overwatering the plant.",
        "Give the plant a liquid fertilizer once it starts producing fruit.",
        "If you want to help your plant grow, buy an organic fertilizer from a garden store or online.",
        "Follow the directions on the fertilizer to feed the plant every 3 weeks or so once you see chilis starting to grow from the plant.",
        "The liquid fertilizer will give even more nutrients to the plant.",
        "Look for a fertilizer that's geared toward fruit production.",
        "Harvesting Green Chiles Harvest the chiles when the fruit is green.",
        "After roughly 2-3 months, green chilis will begin to grow from the plant.",
        "When you\u2019re satisfied with the size of the chilis, it's time to harvest them.",
        "If you want green chilis, remember to cut them off before the chilis start to turn red.",
        "Chiles will turn red the longer they\u2019re left on the plant, and their spiciness will increase with time as well.",
        "They'll begin turning red several weeks after the green chiles are fully grown.",
        "Look to see if the chiles come off of the plant easily.",
        "This is a sign that they're ripe.",
        "If you pull on the chili pepper and it's very difficult to remove from the plant, it's best to wait longer for it to continue growing and ripening.",
        "Pull on the plant gently to avoid damaging it.",
        "Use garden shears or a knife to harvest the chiles.",
        "Take the knife or garden shears and cut the chili off at its green stem, right above the top of the physical chili.",
        "Do this to all of the chiles that you plan on harvesting.",
        "Cut the chiles off when the plant is dry as opposed to wet to avoid spreading diseases.",
        "Consider protecting your hands when dealing with the chili peppers.",
        "The oils from the peppers can irritate your skin, and especially your eyes.",
        "To avoid getting the hot pepper oils on your hands, wear gardening gloves to protect them.",
        "It's also a good idea to wash your hands right after touching the green chiles."
