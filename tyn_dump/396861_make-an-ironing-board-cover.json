Smooth out the IBC completely flat and press (heh! now you've no ironing board to press the IBC on; you can use a towel on the table). Mark a 1\" margin all around the IBC. Measure 1\" (2.5cm) from the outer edge of the casing all around the IBC. Cut the 1\" (2.5cm) margin off from the old IBC. Be careful not to make the first incision from the outer edge of the IBC.

Start pinning the two fabrics together at the flat end (or bottom end) of the IBC. Work your way up evenly on both sides (in other words do not pin one side to the pointed end before doing the other side). Stop pinning before you reach the tip (see pic). Pin the 2 centre points together. Continue pinning the margin to the new IBC fabric. Don't mind the ruffles. As you pin the margin to the new IBC you'll notice that the new IBC fabric ruffles up. Ruffling up is all right, just keep the ruffles reasonably equal in size and be generous with the pins. Stitch the margin to the new IBC fabric.
