You\u2019ll want to use white eggs, as they will show the colors more vividly than brown eggs.

Although they are hard-boiled and more sturdy than raw eggs, it's still possible to crack the shells. You may want to put them back in their carton or in a bowl so they don\u2019t roll away. Part 2: Dyeing the Eggs Fill each cup in the muffin tin halfway with shaving cream. The exact amount of shaving cream you use isn\u2019t super important. You just want to make sure you have enough to thoroughly coat each egg. Add several drops of food coloring to each cup. Mix and match the colors to your liking. Using a muffin tin rather than a cookie sheet allows you to experiment and try different combinations of colors in each cup. For the best results, try using two contrasting colors (like red and blue) or three similar, but complementary colors (like yellow, orange, and red) in a cup. Use a toothpick or cotton swab to swirl the colors together. If you\u2019re using different color combinations, make sure to use a fresh toothpick or cotton swab for each cup to avoid cross contaminating the colors. You don\u2019t need to thoroughly mix it all together. Just gently swirl the colors around for a few seconds in each cup. Place the eggs in the muffin tin cups and roll them until they're coated. Again, you don\u2019t want to mix the shaving cream and food coloring together too thoroughly. Just roll each one 2-4 times to ensure the whole shell is saturated. Leave the eggs to sit in the mixture for 20 minutes. This is enough time for the shells to thoroughly absorb the food coloring in the shaving cream. You can use this time to clean up your dyeing station and put any eggs you didn\u2019t dye in the fridge. Rinse each egg carefully under cold water.
