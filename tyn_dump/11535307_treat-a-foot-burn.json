For a burn on your foot, going into the shower or bathtub and holding your foot under the faucet is easiest. If you\u2019re outdoors, a garden hose could work as well. Make sure any water you use is clean. Any contamination could cause a serious infection. Do not use ice or ice water. Very cold water can cause further skin damage.

If the skin over the burn is still intact, you can also use a cold compress wrapped in a towel. If the burn is severe enough that skin is burned away, don\u2019t apply a could compress.

Assess its degree to determine how severe the burn is. First-degree burns are minor. They only affect the outer layer of skin and cause redness, swelling, and minor pain. Second-degree burns affect deeper skin layers. They cause deep redness, more intense pain, and blistering. Third-degree burns completely burn away the outer layer of skin. The skin may be black or white. You may also feel numbness due to nerve damage. Never try to treat a second or third degree burn by yourself.

Burns over large areas, like the entire bottom of your foot, require a doctor's attention. Additionally, second and third-degree burns on your foot always need medical attention, no matter how small.

Make an appointment as soon as possible. If the burn is severe enough, your doctor may tell you to go to the hospital. Listen to these directions and receive medical attention as soon as possible.

        "Get sterile, non-stick gauze from a pharmacy and wrap your foot loosely.",
        "If you have to, use some surgical tape to secure the gauze.",
        "Do not wrap the surgical tape around your foot.",
        "This cuts off the circulation and slows healing.",
        "Only put a strip along your skin so the gauze stays in place.",
        "Don\u2019t use cotton or a similar product with fibers.",
        "These fibers will get stuck on your skin.",
        "Change your bandage at least once a day.",
        "Also change the bandage any time it gets wet.",
        "Wrap your toes individually if they\u2019re burned.",
        "Otherwise the skin on your toes could get stuck together during the healing process.",
        "Carefully tuck the gauze between each toe and wrap them individually for the best healing results.",
        "If your toes do stick together, hold them under warm running water to gently work them apart.",
        "Keep your foot elevated for 24-48 hours to reduce swelling.",
        "More serious burns may cause significant swelling within the first 48 hours after the injury.",
        "If you\u2019re experiencing swelling, elevate your foot to draw blood away from the area.",
        "For the best results, raise your foot above your heart level.",
        "For a good elevation position, lay back on a couch.",
        "Then place your burned foot on the armrest.",
        "Place 1 or 2 pillows under your foot in bed to keep it elevated.",
        "Clean the burn with gentle soap and cover it with a new bandage daily.",
        "Gently unwrap your burn and discard the old gauze.",
        "Then hold the burn under cool running water and wash it carefully with gentle soap.",
        "Pat it dry with a clean towel or gauze, then re-wrap it with fresh gauze.",
        "Ask your doctor about using soap.",
        "For more serious burns, doctors don\u2019t recommend using soap.",
        "If any gauze gets stuck to your burn, don\u2019t pull them off.",
        "Soak your foot in water to loosen the gauze, then gently remove them.",
        "Move as normally as you can so the skin heals properly.",
        "While it may be painful to walk normally with a burn on your foot, try your best to do so.",
        "If you keep your foot completely immobile, the new skin may grow in too tightly.",
        "This makes moving your foot uncomfortable after the wound heals.",
        "Walk as normally as you can to promote normal healing.",
        "Use a cane if walking on the burn hurts.",
        "This is especially important if the burn is on the bottom of your foot.",
        "Putting any weight on the burn may be painful.",
        "Walking with a cane can increase your mobility and decrease your pain levels.",
        "Doctors sometimes rent canes to patients while they recover.",
        "Speak with your doctor to see if they provide this service or can point you towards someone who does.",
        "Some insurance plans cover canes and crutches if you need them.",
        "Check with older relatives or neighbors to see if they have an extra cane lying around."
