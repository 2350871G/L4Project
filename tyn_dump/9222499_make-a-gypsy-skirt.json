For example, if your natural waist is 36 inches (91 cm), then you would add 2 inches (5 cm) for a total of 38 inches (97 cm) of elastic. If you are using a drawstring, then plan to get at least 20 inches (51 cm) more than you will need. This will provide enough slack to tie the drawstring. For example, if your waist size is 36 inches (91 cm), then get a drawstring that is 56 inches (142 cm) long."

                    "description": "The easiest way to determine the width of each of your tiers is to use the width of your waistband measurement. For a full flowing skirt, double the width of your waistband to get the width of your second tier, and then double the width of your second tier to get the third. If you plan to have four tiers, then double the width of the third tier to get the width for the fourth tier. If you plan to have five tiers, then double the width of the fourth tier to get the width for the fifth tier.For example, if your hip measurement for the first tier was 40 inches (107 cm), then your second tier would be 80 inches (203 cm), your third tier would be 160 inches (406 cm). If you want four tiers, then your fourth tier would be 320 inches (813 cm). If you want five tiers, then your fifth tier would be 640 inches (1,626 cm)! Keep in mind that doubling each tier will require lots of fabric, so it might be quite expensive to make a skirt this wide and flowing. You can also make your skirt narrower by adjusting the ratio of your other tiers compared with the waistband tier. For example, you could multiply the width of your first tier by 1.25 to get the width for the second tier, then multiply the width of the second tier by 1.5 to get the width of the third tier, and do the same for the fourth tier. This will still result in a full skirt, but it won\u2019t be as full as doubling each of the tiers."

You will need to know the size of your natural waist (or wherever you want the waistband of your skirt to be) to determine how much elastic or drawstring to buy.

For example, if your natural waist is 36 inches (91 cm), then you would add 2 inches (5 cm) for a total of 38 inches (97 cm) of elastic. If you are using a drawstring, then plan to get at least 20 inches (51 cm) more than you will need. This will provide enough slack to tie the drawstring. For example, if your waist size is 36 inches (91 cm), then get a drawstring that is 56 inches (142 cm) long. Measure to determine your skirt length.

The easiest way to determine the width of each of your tiers is to use the width of your waistband measurement.

        "Starting with the bottom two tiers, pin the tiers together so that the right sides of the fabric are lined up.",
        "You will need to pleat\u2014create small folds in\u2014your bottom tier to match up all of the edges with the tier above it.",
        "Start by lining up the seams of the two tiers and then work around the skirt to pin the edges together.Make a pleat in the fabric of the bottom tier every couple of inches to ensure that you will be able to evenly line up the tiers.",
        "Remember when you are pinning that the bottom edge of the top tier will always be ungathered, and top edge of the bottom tier will always be gathered.",
        "Sew the bottom two tiers together before pinning any more tiers.",
        "Sew the tiers together.",
        "When you have pinned the tiers together, take the tiers to your sewing machine and sew around the pinned edges of the tiers to connect them.",
        "Sew about \u00bd\u201d from the edges of the fabric.",
        "Remove the pins as you go.After you finish sewing together two of the tiers, pin and pleat the next tier to the tier below it and then sew the edges together as you did with the bottom two tiers.",
        "Keep repeating this process until all of your tiers are connected.",
        "Finishing the Skirt Create the waistband.",
        "Fold over the top 2 inches (5 cm) of your top tier and pin it into place.",
        "Make sure to fold the fabric over so that the wrong sides are matching up and will not be visible.",
        "Then, begin to sew around the bottom edge of the fold to create the waistband.",
        "When you reach the end of the waistband, backstitch a couple of times to secure the stitches.",
        "Work your elastic or drawstring into the waistband.",
        "You will need to cut a small slit in the inside of your waistband to insert your elastic or drawstring.",
        "Cut through the inside layer of the waistband fabric only and not through both layers.",
        "Then, begin to work your elastic or drawstring through the slit.",
        "Whether you are using elastic or a drawstring, it helps to attach a safety pin to one end of the elastic or drawstring.",
        "This will make it easier to work the elastic or drawstring through the waistband.",
        "If you are using elastic, then you will need to sew the ends of the elastic together after you get the elastic all the way through the waistband.",
        "This will cause the top of the skirt to gather.",
        "Then sew the slit closed after you have secured the ends of the elastic.",
        "If you are using a drawstring, all you need to do to is work the drawstring through and pull the ends to adjust the waist to your liking.",
        "If desired, you can also use a buttonhole attachment to sew around the edges of the slit or stitch around the edges of the slit by hand.",
        "This will help to reinforce the opening.",
        "Hem the bottom tier.",
        "To finish your skirt, you will just need to hem the bottom of the bottom tier.",
        "You can easily do this by pinning the bottom \u00bd\u201d (1.3 cm) of fabric under and sewing around the edge of the fabric.",
        "You can either use a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch to secure the hem.",
        "After you finish sewing the hem, cut the excess thread and your skirt is ready to wear!"
