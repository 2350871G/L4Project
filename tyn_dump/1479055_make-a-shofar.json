Kosher animals are those that have split hooves and chew their cud. For the purpose of making a shofar, use either the ram's horn or antelope. Place the horn into a roaster or other large pan, and cover the horn with water.  Boil the horn for 2 to 5 hours or until it is soft and you can remove the internal cartilage. Use a kitchen pick, such as those used to remove nuts from their shells, to clean the horn and make it hollow. If you do not have a pick, any thin object that can reach into the small spaces may be used to clean the shofar. Thread a wire through the horn to measure the depth of the hollow space inside. Allow the horn to dry completely. Measure 1 inch (2.54 cm) past the end of the hollow area, and mark that point on the horn. Cut the tip of the thoroughly-dried shofar horn off at the mark. Drill a 1/8-inch (.32 cm) hole through the cut end of the shofar.  Carve a mouthpiece on the shofar horn, similar to that of a trumpet. Fit the mouthpiece to the individual who will blow the shofar during its liturgical use.",
